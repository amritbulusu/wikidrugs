'''Dextropropoxyphene'''<ref>US Patent 2728779 - Esters of Substituted Aminobutanes</ref> is an [[analgesic]] in the [[opioid]] category, patented in 1955<ref>Thieme Chemistry (Hrsg.): RÖMPP Online – Version 3.32. Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart, 30. April 2013.</ref> and manufactured by [[Eli Lilly and Company]].  It is an [[optical isomer]] of [[levopropoxyphene]]. It is intended to treat mild pain and also has [[antitussive]] (cough suppressant) and [[local anaesthetic]] effects. The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/736718?src=mp&spon=25 Physicians Say Good Riddance to 'Worst Drug in History'] By Allison Gandey. February 2, 2011</ref> Its onset of analgesia (pain relief) is said to be 20–30 minutes and peak effects are seen about 1.5–2 hours after oral administration.<ref name = cancer/>

Dextropropoxyphene is sometimes combined with [[acetaminophen]]. Trade names include Darvocet-N and Di-Gesic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspenpharma.com.au/PDF/CMI/CMI_Digesic.pdf|title=Consumer Medicine Information: Digesic|work=Aspen Pharmacare Australia Pty Ltd}}</ref> Darvon with APAP (for dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol).<ref>Nursing Drug Handbook, Springhouse, page 306</ref> The [[British approved name]] (i.e. the generic name of the active ingredient) of the paracetamol/dextropropoxyphene preparation is "''co-proxamol''" (sold under a variety of brand names); however, it has been withdrawn since 2007, and is no longer available to new patients, with exceptions.<ref>BNF Edition 57, BNF.org</ref> The paracetamol combination(s) are known as Capadex or Di-Gesic in [[Australia]], Lentogesic in [[South Africa]], and Di-Antalvic in [[France]] (unlike co-proxamol, which is an approved name, these are all brand names).

Dextropropoxyphene is known under several synonyms, including:
* Alpha-d-4-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1,2-diphenyl-2-butanol propionate
* [(2''S'',3''R'')-4-(Dimethylamino)-3- methyl-1,2-diphenylbutan-2-yl] propanoate
* (+)-1,2-Diphenyl-2-propionoxy- 3-methyl-4-di-methylaminobutane
* Desoxypropiophen

==Uses==

===Analgesia===
Dextropropoxyphene, like [[codeine]], is a weak [[opioid]], known to cause dependency among recreational users. Codeine is more commonly used; however, as codeine is, in essence, a [[prodrug]] that requires ''[[in vivo]]'' [[Drug metabolism|metabolism]] for efficacy, it is ineffective for some individuals with the "poor metabolizer" genotype of the liver [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP2D6]]. In people with this low-function isoform, dextropropoxyphene is particularly useful, as its metabolism does not require CYP2D6. It is also used for patients with digestive complaints, as it is less liable to worsen their symptoms.

===Restless legs syndrome===
Dextropropoxyphene has been found to be helpful in relieving the symptoms of [[restless legs syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/restless-legs-syndrome |title=Restless legs syndrome: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepmedicinecenters.com/Home/SleepDisorders/RestlessLegsSyndrome |title=Restless Leg Syndrome - Sleep Medicine Centers of WNY |publisher=Sleepmedicinecenters.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rls.org/Document.Doc?&id=3 |work=Restless Leg Syndrome Foundation |title=Causes, diagnosis and treatment for the patient living with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) |publisher= |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref>

===Opioid withdrawal===
In pure form, dextropropoxyphene is commonly used to ease the [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms in people addicted to opioids. Being very weak in comparison to commonly abused opioids, dextropropoxyphene can only act as a "partial" substitute. It does not have much effect on mental cravings; however, it can be effective in alleviating physical withdrawal effects, such as muscle cramps.

===Contraindications===
Dextropropoxyphene is contraindicated in patients [[allergy|allergic]] to paracetamol (acetaminophen) or dextropropoxyphene, and in [[alcoholism|alcoholics]]. Dextropropoxyphene is not intended for use in patients who are prone to suicide, anxiety, panic, or addiction.

===Side effects===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
*Constipation
*Itching
*Drowsiness
*Sore throat
*Impaired alertness
*Confusion
*Serious or fatal heart rhythms
*Nausea

== Pharmacology ==

Dextropropoxyphene acts as an [[mu-opioid receptor]] [[agonist]]. It also acts as a potent, [[noncompetitive]] [[alpha-3 beta-4 nicotinic receptor|α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>4</sub>]] neuronal [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] [[nicotinic antagonist|antagonist]],<ref name="urlBlockade of Rat α3β4 Nicotinic Receptor Function by Methadone, Its Metabolites, and Structural Analogs — JPET">{{cite web | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/299/1/366.abstract | title = Blockade of Rat α3β4 Nicotinic Receptor Function by Methadone, Its Metabolites, and Structural Analogs — JPET | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref> as well as a weak [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]].

==Toxicity==
Overdose is commonly broken into two categories: [[liver]] toxicity (from [[paracetamol poisoning]]) and dextropropoxyphene overdose.

An overdose of dextropropoxyphene may lead to various systemic effects. Excessive opioid receptor stimulation is responsible for the [[CNS depression]], [[respiratory depression]], [[aspiration pneumonia]], [[miosis]], and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]- or [[thought]]-altering effects. In the presence of amphetamine, propoxyphene overdose will increase CNS stimulation and may cause fatal convulsive seizures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/017078s048lbl.pdf|title=Dexedrine® (dextroamphetamine sulfate) Spansule® sustained release capsules [Label]|last=|first=|date=|website=US Food and Drug Administration|publisher=Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC|publication-date=February 2015|access-date=November 11, 2016|quote=In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.}}</ref>

In addition, both propoxyphene and its metabolite [[norpropoxyphene]] have local [[anesthetic]] effects at concentrations about 10 times those necessary for opioid effects. Norpropoxyphene is a more potent local anesthetic than propoxyphene, and they are both more potent than [[lidocaine]].<ref name=Nickander1>Nickander ''et al.'', 1984</ref> Local anesthetic activity appears to be responsible for the [[arrhythmias]] and cardiovascular depression seen in propoxyphene poisoning.<ref name=Strom1/>

Both propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are potent blockers of cardiac membrane [[sodium channels]] and are more potent than [[lidocaine]], [[quinidine]], and [[procainamide]] in this respect.<ref name=Holland1>Holland & Steinberg, 1979</ref> As a result, propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene appear to have the characteristics of a [[Antiarrhythmic agent#Class Ic agents|Vaughn-Williams Class Ic antiarrhythmic]].

These direct cardiac effects include decreased [[heart rate]] (i.e. cardiovascular depression), decreased [[contractility]], and decreased [[electrical conductivity]] (i.e., increased PR, AH, HV, and QRS intervals). These effects appear to be due to their local anesthetic activity and are not reversed by [[naloxone]].<ref name=Nickander1/><ref name=Strom1>Strom ''et al.'', 1985b</ref><ref name=Bredgaard1>Bredgaard, Sorensen ''et al.'', 1984</ref> Widening of the QRS complex appears to be a result of a quinidine-like effect of propoxyphene, and [[sodium bicarbonate]] therapy appears to have a positive direct effect on the QRS dysrhythmia.<ref name=Stork1>Stork ''et al.'', 1995</ref>

[[Seizure]]s may result from either opioid or local anesthetic effects.<ref name=Nickander1/> [[Pulmonary edema]] may result from direct [[pulmonary toxicity]], [[neurogenic]]/[[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxic]] effects, or cardiovascular depression.<ref name=Strom1/>

[[Balance disorder]] is possible, with risk of falls from standing height.

==Available forms==
Propoxyphene was initially introduced as propoxyphene hydrochloride. Shortly before the patent on propoxyphene expired, propoxyphene napsylate form was introduced to the market. Napsylate salt (the salt of [[Naphthalene#Substituted derivatives|naphthalenesulfonic acid]]) is claimed to be less prone to abuse, because it is almost insoluble in water, so cannot be used for injection. Napsylate also gives lower peak blood level.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0-7817-3481-9|title=Wilson and Gisvold's textbook of organic medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|author1=Wilson, Charles Owens  |author2=Gisvold, John H}}</ref> Because of different molecular mass, a dose of 100&nbsp;mg of propoxyphene napsylate is required to supply an amount of propoxyphene equivalent to that present in 65&nbsp;mg of propoxyphene hydrochloride.

Before the FDA-directed recall, dextropropoxyphene HCl was available in the [[United States]] as a prescription formulation with [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) in ratio from 30&nbsp;mg / 600&nbsp;mg to 100&nbsp;mg / 650&nbsp;mg (or 100&nbsp;mg / 325&nbsp;mg in the case of Balacet), respectively. These are usually named [[Darvocet]]. Darvon is a pure propoxyphene preparation that does not contain paracetamol.

In Australia, dextropropoxyphene is available on prescription, both as a combined product (32.5&nbsp;mg dextropropoxyphene per 325&nbsp;mg [[paracetamol]] branded as Di-gesic, Capadex, or Paradex; it is also available in pure form (100&nbsp;mg capsules) known as Doloxene.

==Drug testing==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Detectable levels of propoxyphene/dextropropoxyphene may stay in a person's system for up to 9 days after last dose and can be tested for specifically in nonstandard urinalysis, but may remain in the body longer in minuscule amounts. Propoxyphene will not show up on standard opiate/opioid tests because it is not chemically related to opiates as part of the OPI or OPI 2000 panels, which detect morphine and related compounds. It is most closely related to [[methadone]].

==Usage controversy and regulation==
[[Image:Doloxen.jpg|thumb|right|Trade name: Doloxene (100 mg; dextropropoxyphene napsylate)]]

Dextropropoxyphene is subject to some controversy: while many [[physician]]s prescribe it for a wide range of mildly to moderately painful symptoms, as well as for treatment of [[diarrhea]], many others refuse to prescribe it, citing limited effectiveness. In addition, the [[therapeutic index]] of dextroproxyphene is relatively narrow.

Caution should be used when administering dextropropoxyphene, particularly with children and the elderly and with patients who may be pregnant or breast feeding; other reported problems include kidney, liver or respiratory disorders, and prolonged use. Attention should be paid to concomitant use with tranquillizers, antidepressants or excess alcohol.

Darvon, a dextropropoxyphene formulation made by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], which had been on the market for 25 years, came under heavy fire in 1978 by consumer groups that said it was associated with [[suicide]]. Darvon was never withdrawn from the market, until recently. But Lilly has waged a sweeping, and largely successful, campaign{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} among doctors, pharmacists and Darvon users to defend the drug as safe when it is used in proper doses and not mixed with alcohol. After determining the risks outweigh the benefits, the USFDA requested physicians stop prescribing the drug. On November 19, 2010 the FDA announced that Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals agreed to withdraw Darvon and Darvocet in the United States, followed by manufacturers of dextropropoxyphene.<ref name="cnn101119">[http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/19/fda.removes.drug/ "FDA pulls common pain med off the market"].

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], both pure dextropropoxyphene capsules (as napsylate, 100&nbsp;mg), marketed as Doloxene, and combination tablets and capsules (with paracetamol) all containing 32.5&nbsp;mg dextropropoxyphene HCl with 325&nbsp;mg paracetamol, which are currently available on prescription were supposed to be withdrawn from 1 March 2012,<ref>http://www.tga.gov.au/newsroom/media-2011-dextropropoxyphene-111122.htm</ref> but Aspen Pharma sought a review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which ruled in 2013 that the drugs could be sold under strict conditions.

===Canada===
On December 1, 2010, Health Canada and Paladin Labs Inc. announced the voluntary recall and withdrawal of Darvon-N from the Canadian market and the discontinuation of sale of Darvon-N.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/advisories-avis/public/_2010/darvon-n_pc-cp-eng.php Health Canada: Darvon-N (dextropopoxyphene) - Recall and Withdrawal in Canada]</ref>

=== European Union ===
In November 2007, the [[European Commission]] requested the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) to review the safety and effectiveness of dextropropoxyphene based medicines and on 25 June 2009 the EMA recommended a gradual withdrawal throughout the [[European Union]]. The EMA's conclusion was based on evidence that dextropropoxyphene-containing medicines were weak painkillers, the combination of dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol was no more effective than paracetamol on its own, and the difference between the dose needed for treatment and a harmful dose (the "[[therapeutic index]]") was too small.<ref>

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], physicians had long been discouraged by the medical products agency to prescribe dextropropoxyphene due to the risk of respiratory depression and even death when taken with alcohol.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/Tpl/NewsPage____495.aspx |title = ''Fasta kombinationer av smärtstillande läkemedel innehållande dextropropoxifen försvinner från marknaden under hösten 2005'' |trans_title=Fixed combinations of analgesic drugs containing dextropropoxyphene disappear from the market in the autumn of 2005 |language = Swedish |publisher = Läkemedelsverket |date = 5 May 2005 }}</ref> Physicians have earlier been recommended to prescribe products with only dextropropoxyphene and not to patients with a history of drug abuse, depression or suicidal tendencies. Products with mixed active ingredients were taken off the market and only products with dextropropoxyphene were allowed to be sold.  Dextropoxyphene was ''[[de facto]] narcotica'' labelled.

As of March 2011, all products containing the substance are withdrawn because of safety issues after a [[European Commission]] decision.<ref>[http://www.medicinesauthority.gov.mt/pub/Dextropoxyphene.pdf medicinesauthority.gov.mt], EU-decision</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/Alla-nyheter/NYHETER-2010/Dextropropoxifen-dras-bort-fran-marknaden/ |title=Dextropropoxyphene is removed from the market |language=swedish |date=5 May 2005}}</ref>

It was discussed at the time that people who abuse alcohol and other substances and take combination dextropoxyphene / acetaminophen (paracetamol) may need to take many combination tablets to reach [[euphoria]], because the amount of dextropropoxyphene per tablet is relatively low (30–40&nbsp;mg). The ingested paracetamol—the other component—may then reach liver toxic levels. In the case of alcoholics, who often already have damaged livers, even a relatively small overdose with paracetamol may produce [[hepatotoxicity]], [[liver failure]] and [[necrosis]]. This toxicity with the combination of overdosed dextroproxyphene (with its CNS/[[respiratory depression]]/vomit with risk for [[aspiration pneumonia]], as well as [[cardiotoxicity]]) and paracetamol-induced liver damage can result in [[death]].

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, preparations containing only dextropropoxyphene were discontinued in 2004.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4221829.stm Painkiller Scrapped Over Suicides]</ref> In 2007, the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] removed the licence for co-proxamol, also called distalgesic.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/aches-and-pains/medicines/distalgesic.html|title = Distalgesic (discontinued in the UK - December 2007)|date = 9 January 2008|accessdate = 8 September 2013|website = netdoctor}}</ref> From then on in the UK, co-proxamol is only available on a named patient basis, for long-term chronic pain and only to those who have already been prescribed this medicine. Its withdrawal from the UK market is a result of concerns relating to its toxicity in overdose (even small overdoses can be fatal), and dangerous reaction with alcohol. Recreational use in the UK is uncommon. Many patients have been prescribed alternative combinations of drugs as a replacement.<ref>BNF.org, BNF edition 57, Retrieved 28 August 2009</ref>

The motivation for the withdrawal of co-proxamol was the reduction in suicides and a key part of the agency's justification of its decision was based upon studies showing co-proxamol was no more effective than paracetamol alone in pain management.<ref name="mhra.gov.uk">[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/con019461 "Withdrawal of co-proxamol products and interim updated prescribing information"]. [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA). 31 January 2005. Retrieved August 28, 2009.</ref> Prescribing authorities, such as the Royal College of General Practitioners, unanimously recommended withdrawal, while patients who responded to the agency's request for information tended to want to continue treatment.<ref>[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/con019463 "Outcome of the public request for information on the risks and benefits of the pain killer co-proxamol"]. [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA).</ref>

The co-proxamol preparations available in the UK contained a subtherapeutic dose of paracetamol, 325&nbsp;mg per tablet.<ref>[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/CON019462 "Co-proxamol: outcome of the review of risks and benefits"]. Questions and Answers leaflet, Retrieved August 28, 2009</ref> Patients were warned not to take more than eight tablets in one day, a total dose of 2600&nbsp;mg paracetamol per day.  Despite this reduced level, patients were still at a high risk of overdose; coproxamol was second only to [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s as the most common prescription drugs used in overdose.<ref name="mhra.gov.uk"/> Following the reduction in prescribing in 2005–2007, prior to its complete withdrawal, the number of deaths associated with the drug dropped significantly. Additionally, patients have not substituted other drugs as a method of overdose.<ref>{{cite journal

The decision to withdraw coproxamol has met with some controversy; it has been brought up in the House of Commons on two occasions, 13 July 2005<ref>[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2005-07-13a.936.0 Co-Proxamol: 13 Jul 2005: House of Commons debates (TheyWorkForYou.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and on 17 January 2007.<ref>[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2007-01-17b.340.0 Co-proxamol: 17 Jan 2007: Westminster Hall debates (TheyWorkForYou.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Patients have found alternatives to co-proxamol either too strong, too weak, or with intolerable side effects.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} During the House of Commons debates, it is quoted that originally some 1,700,000 patients in the UK were prescribed co-proxamol. Following the phased withdrawal, this has eventually been reduced to 70,000. However, it appears this is the residual pool of patients who cannot find alternate analgesia to co-proxamol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The safety net of prescribing co-proxamol after license withdrawal from 31 December 2007, on a "named patient" basis where doctors agree there is a clinical need, has been rejected by most UK doctors{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} because the wording that "responsibility will fall on the prescriber" is unacceptable to most doctors. Some patients intend to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/youropinions.php?opinionid=25173 Failure Of MHRA Coproxamol Named Patient System - Visitor Opinion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, the European Medicines Agency has recently backed the agency's decision, and recommended in June 2009 that propoxyphene preparations be withdrawn across the European Union.<ref>[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/CON049300 News Centre : MHRA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On 28 March 2017 NHS Clinical Commissioners announced that co-proxamol will be no longer available under NHS England as part of £400m of spending cuts for prescriptions that are believed to have little or no clinical value.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39413915|title=NHS targets suncream prescriptions for cuts|last=Triggle|first=Nick|date=2017-03-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===United States===
In January 2009, an FDA advisory committee voted 14 to 12 against the continued marketing of propoxyphene products, based on its weak pain-killing abilities, addictiveness, association with drug deaths and possible heart problems, including [[arrhythmia]]. A subsequent re-evaluation resulted in a July 2009 recommendation to strengthen the boxed warning for propoxyphene to reflect the risk of overdose.<ref>{{cite news | title = FDA Takes Actions on Darvon, Other Pain Medications Containing Propoxyphene | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) | date = 7 July 2009 | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm170769.htm}}</ref> Dextropropoxyphene subsequently carried a [[black box warning]] in the U.S., stating:
