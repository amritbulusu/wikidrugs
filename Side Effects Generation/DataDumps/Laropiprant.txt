'''Laropiprant''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) was a drug used in combination with [[niacin]] to reduce blood cholesterol ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] and [[VLDL]]) that is no longer sold, due to increases in side-effects with no cardiovascular benefit. Laropiprant itself has no cholesterol lowering effect, but it reduces facial [[Flushing (physiology)|flushes]] induced by niacin.

[[Merck & Co.]] planned to market this combination under the trade names '''Cordaptive''' in the US and '''Tredaptive''' in Europe. Both brands contained 1000&nbsp;mg of niacin and 20&nbsp;mg of laropiprant in each tablet.<ref name="Tredaptive_pi">{{cite web

==Mechanism of action==
Niacin in cholesterol lowering doses (500–2000&nbsp;mg per day) causes facial flushes by stimulating biosynthesis of [[prostaglandin D2|prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>]] (PGD<sub>2</sub>), especially in the skin. PGD<sub>2</sub> [[vasodilator|dilates the blood vessels]] via activation of the [[prostaglandin D2 receptor|prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] subtype [[prostaglandin DP1 receptor|DP<sub>1</sub>]], increasing blood flow and thus leading to flushes.<ref name="Tredaptive_pi" /><ref>{{Cite journal

Taking 325&nbsp;mg of [[aspirin]] 20–30 minutes prior to taking niacin has also been proven to prevent flushing in 90% of patients, presumably by suppressing prostaglandin synthesis,<ref>

On January 11, 2013, Merck & Co Inc. announced they were withdrawing the drug worldwide as a result of European regulators recommendations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Merck withdraws cholesterol drug Tredaptive globally|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/11/us-merck-cholesteroldrug-withdrawal-idUSBRE90A0MB20130111?feedType=RSS&feedName=healthNews|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=January 11, 2013}}</ref>

The Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-THRIVE) involved more than 25,000 adults. The treatment group received 2 g of extended-release niacin and 40&nbsp;mg of laropiprant daily. Study results, reported in July 2014, showed that the combination of niacin and laropiprant did not have any beneficial effects when compared with a [[placebo]] treatment and had an increase in adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal
