'''Stiripentol''' (marketed as '''Diacomit''' by Laboratoires Biocodex) is an [[anticonvulsant]] drug used in the treatment of [[epilepsy]]. It is approved for the treatment of [[Dravet syndrome]], an [[epilepsy syndrome]]. It is unrelated to other anticonvulsants and belongs to the group of [[aromatic]] [[allyl]]ic [[alcohols]].

==Medical use==
It is used in some countries as an add-on therapy with [[sodium valproate]] and [[clobazam]] for treating children with [[Dravet syndrome]] whose seizures are not adequately controlled.<ref name=Cochrane2017>{{cite journal|last1=Brigo|first1=F|last2=Igwe|first2=SC|last3=Bragazzi|first3=NL|title=Antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of infants with severe myoclonic epilepsy.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=18 May 2017|volume=5|pages=CD010483|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010483.pub4|pmid=28521067}}</ref><ref name=Nickels2017>{{cite journal|last1=Nickels|first1=KC|last2=Wirrell|first2=EC|title=Stiripentol in the Management of Epilepsy.|journal=CNS drugs|date=May 2017|volume=31|issue=5|pages=405-416|doi=10.1007/s40263-017-0432-1|pmid=28434133}}</ref><ref name=EMASPC>{{cite web|title=Diacomit (stiripentol) SPC|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000664/WC500036518.pdf|publisher=EMA|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=8 January 2014}} For updates see [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000664/human_med_000742.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 EMA index page]</ref>  As of 2017 it was not known whether stiripentol remains useful as children become adolescents nor as they become adults.<ref name=Nabbout2017>{{cite journal|last1=Nabbout|first1=R|last2=Camfield|first2=CS|last3=Andrade|first3=DM|last4=Arzimanoglou|first4=A|last5=Chiron|first5=C|last6=Cramer|first6=JA|last7=French|first7=JA|last8=Kossoff|first8=E|last9=Mula|first9=M|last10=Camfield|first10=PR|title=Treatment issues for children with epilepsy transitioning to adult care.|journal=Epilepsy & behavior : E&B|date=April 2017|volume=69|pages=153-160|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2016.11.008|pmid=28188045}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Very common (more than 10% of people) adverse effects include loss of appetite, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, [[ataxia]], [[hypotonia]], and [[dystonia]].<ref name=EMASPC/>

Common (between 1% and than 10% of people) adverse effects include [[neutropenia]] (sometimes severe), aggressiveness, irritability, behavior disorders, opposing behavior, hyperexcitability, sleep disorders, hyperkinesias, nausea, vomiting, and elevated [[gamma-glutamyltransferase]].<ref name=EMASPC/>

==Interactions==
Stiripentol inhibits several [[cytochrome P450]] [[Isozyme|isoenzymes]] and so interacts with many anticonvulsants and other medicines.<ref name=EMASPC/>

==Pharmacology==
As with most anticonvulsants, the precise mechanism of action is unknown. Regardless, stiripentol has been shown to have anticonvulsant effects of its own.

Stiripentol increases [[GABA]]ergic activity. At clinically relevant concentrations, it enhances central GABA neurotransmission through a [[barbiturate]]-like effect, since it increases the duration of opening of GABA-A receptor channels in hippocampal slices.<ref name="pmid16650136">{{cite journal |vauthors=Quilichini PP, Chiron C, Ben-Ari Y, Gozlan H |title=Stiripentol, a putative antiepileptic drug, enhances the duration of opening of GABA-A receptor channels |journal=Epilepsia : PR |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=704–16 |year=2006 |pmid=16650136 |doi= 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2006.00497.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118726053/PDFSTART}}</ref> It has also been shown to increase [[GABA]] levels in brain tissues by interfering with its reuptake and [[metabolism]].<ref name="pmid15886413">{{cite journal |vauthors=Trojnar MK, Wojtal K, Trojnar MP, Czuczwar SJ |title=Stiripentol.

Inhibition of this enzyme can make neurons less prone to fire action potentials, likely through activation of [[ATP-sensitive potassium channels]].<ref name="pmid25792327">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sada N, Lee S, Katsu T, Otsuki T, Inoue T |title=Targeting LDH enzymes with a stiripentol analog to treat epilepsy |journal=Science |volume=347 |issue=6228 |pages=1362–67 |year=2015 |pmid=25792327 |doi= 10.1126/science.aaa1299|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6228/1362.short}}</ref>

Stiripentol also improves the effectiveness of many other anticonvulsants, possibly due to its inhibition of certain enzymes, slowing the drugs' metabolism and increasing [[blood plasma]] levels.<ref name=EMASPC/>

==Chemistry==
Stiripentol is an α-ethylene alcohol; its chemical formula is 4,4-dimethyl-1-[3,4-(methylendioxy)-phenyl]-1penten-3-ol.  It is chiral and is marketed as an equimolar racemic mixture.  The R enantiomer appears to be around 2.5 times more active than the S enantiomer.<ref name=EMASCI>{{cite web|title=Scientific evaluation|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Scientific_Discussion/human/000664/WC500036521.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=2007}}</ref>

==History==
Stiripentol was discovered in 1978 by scientists at Biocodex and clinical trials started over the next few years.<ref name=EMASCI/> It was originally developed for adults with focal seizures, but failed a Phase III trial.<ref name=Nabbout2017/>

In December 2001 the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) granted stiripentol [[orphan drug]] status (designation number EU/3/01/071) for the treatment of [[severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy]] (SMEI, also known as Dravet's syndrome) in children and in 2007, the EMA granted the drug a marketing authorisation for use of the drug as an add-on to other anti-seizure drugs.<ref name=EMASPC/>  It was approved in Canada for this use in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stiripentol (Diacomit): For Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy in Infancy (Dravet Syndrome)|url=https://www.cadth.ca/sites/default/files/cdr/clinical/sr0360_diacomit_cl_report.pdf|publisher=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health|date=April 2015}}</ref>  As of 2017 it was also approved for this use in Japan.<ref name=Nickels2017/>

As of 2014 it was not approved in the US, and parents of children with Dravets were paying around $1,000 for a month supply to obtain it from Europe.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kossoff|first1=E|title=Stiripentol for dravet syndrome: is it worth it?|journal=Epilepsy currents|date=January 2014|volume=14|issue=1|pages=22-3|doi=10.5698/1535-7597-14.1.22|pmid=24526870|pmc=3913306}}</ref>
