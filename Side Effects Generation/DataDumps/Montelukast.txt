'''Montelukast''' (trade name '''Singulair''') is a [[leukotriene receptor antagonist]] (LTRA) used for the maintenance treatment of [[asthma]] and to relieve symptoms of seasonal [[allergy|allergies]].<ref>Lipkowitz, Myron A. and Navarra, Tova (2001) ''The Encyclopedia of Allergies'' (2nd ed.) Facts on File, New York, p. 178, {{ISBN|0-8160-4404-X}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mascothealth.com/showproducts.php?cat=Asthma%20/%20Allergy "Asthma / Allergy "].  Mascothealth.com. Retrieved 9 April 2011.</ref> Montelukast comes as a tablet, a chewable tablet, flash tablet and granules to take by mouth.<ref name="medline" /> Montelukast is usually taken once a day with or without food.<ref name="medline">Montelukast article on Medline Plus http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a600014.html "Montelukast comes as a tablet, a chewable tablet, and granules to take by mouth. Montelukast is usually taken once a day with or without food."</ref>  Montelukast is a [[Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1|CysLT<sub>1</sub>]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]]; it blocks the action of [[leukotriene]] D4 (and secondary ligands LTC4 and LTE4) on the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CysLT<sub>1</sub> in the lungs and bronchial tubes by binding to it.  This reduces the [[bronchoconstriction]] otherwise caused by the leukotriene and results in less inflammation.

Because of its mechanism of action, it is not useful in the treatment of acute [[asthma attack]]s.

The ''Mont'' in Montelukast stands for [[Montreal]], the place where [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] developed the drug.<ref>http://www.merckfrosst.ca/mfcl/en/corporate/research/accomplishments/singulair.html</ref>

==Medical uses==
Montelukast is used for a number of conditions including [[asthma]], exercise induced [[bronchospasm]], [[allergic rhinitis]], primary [[dysmenorrhoea]] (i.e. dysmenorrhoea not associated with known causes; see [[Dysmenorrhea#Causes|dysmenorrhea causes]]), and [[urticaria]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Montelukast Sodium|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/montelukast-sodium.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> It is mainly used as a complementary therapy in adults in addition to [[inhaled corticosteroids]], if they alone do not bring the desired effect. It is also used to prevent allergic reactions and asthma flare-ups during the administration of [[intravenous immunoglobulin]].

Montelukast is administered as montelukast sodium, with 5.2{{nbsp}}mg of montelukast sodium being equivalent to 5{{nbsp}}mg of montelukast.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ijppsjournal.com/Vol4Issue2/3524.pdf |title=Formulation, development and in-vitro evaluation of mucoadhesive bilayered buccal patches of montelukast sodium |first1=Rajeev |last1=Soni |first2=Gali Vidya |last2=Sagar |first3=Pankaj |last3=Sharma |journal=International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2012}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

Common [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mild rashes, asymptomatic elevations in [[liver enzymes]], and [[fever]]. Uncommon side effects include fatigue and malaise, behavioral changes, [[paresthesias]] and seizures, muscle cramps, and nose bleeds. Rare but sometimes serious side effects include severe behavioral changes (including [[suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]]), [[angioedema]], [[erythema multiforme]], and [[hepatitis|liver problems]].<ref name="med.org.uk" />

===FDA investigation===
In March 2008, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced that it would investigate whether mood changes and suicidal thoughts are possible side effects of drugs in this class, including the popular drug Singulair, which currently lists these side effects.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=4541118 FDA Investigates Merck Drug-Suicide Link]</ref>

On June 12, 2009, the FDA concluded their review into the possibility of [[neuropsychiatric]] side effects with leukotriene modulator drugs. Although clinical trials only revealed an increased risk of [[insomnia]], [[post-marketing surveillance]] showed that the drugs are associated with a possible increase in [[suicide|suicidal]] behavior and other side effects such as [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[aggression]], [[anxiousness]], [[dream]] abnormalities and [[hallucinations]], depression, [[irritability]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], and [[tremor]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm165489.htm Updated Information on Leukotriene Inhibitors: Montelukast (marketed as Singulair), Zafirlukast (marketed as Accolate), and Zileuton (marketed as Zyflo and Zyflo CR)]. Food and Drug Administration. Published June 12, 2009. Accessed June 13, 2009.</ref>

==Drug interactions==
Montelukast, unlike many drugs, has very few drug-drug interactions. This is due to the lack of off-target affinity towards other targets in the body where it might exert an effect. However, it is important to note that montelukast is an [[enzyme induction and inhibition|inhibitor]] of the drug metabolizing enzyme [[CYP2C8]]. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that the combination of montelukast with a CYP2C8 substrate (e.g. [[amodiaquine]], an anti-malarial drug) could increase the plasma concentrations of the substrate.<ref>Artesunate Amodiaquine Winthrop (artesunate, amodiaquine) [summary of product characteristics]. Gentilly, France: Sanofi-aventis; August 2010. http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/research/en/data/sanofi/marketed_products/Artesunate_and_Amodiquine.pdf</ref><ref>German P, Greenhouse B, Coates C, et al. Hepatotoxicity due to a drug interaction between amodiaquine plus artesunate and efavirenz. Clin Infect Dis. 2007;44(6):889-891. PID: 17304470</ref>

==Pharmacogenetics==
Two genes of interest are [[Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase|''ALOX5'']] and [[Leukotriene C4 synthase|''LCT4S'']].

==Use with loratadine==

[[Schering-Plough]] and [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] sought permission to market a combined tablet with [[loratadine]] (Claritin) and montelukast (Singulair), as many patients combine the two themselves. However, the FDA has found no benefit from a combined pill for seasonal allergies over taking the two drugs in combination,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/04/28/fda-sneezes-at-claritin-singulair-combo-pill/?mod=WSJBlog | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Sarah | last=Rubenstein | title=FDA Sneezes at Claritin-Singulair Combo Pill | date=April 28, 2008}}</ref> and on April 25, 2008, issued a "not approvable" letter for the combination.<ref>[http://www.schering-plough.com/schering_plough/news/release.jsp?releaseID=1135270   Schering-Plough press release - Schering-Plough/MERCK Pharmaceuticals Receives Not-Approvable Letter from FDA for Loratadine/Montelukast]</ref>

==Uses under study==
Ludwig Aigner from Paracelsus Medical University in Austria presented findings at the October 2015 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Chicago which showed that administration of Montelukast to older rats rejuvenated their brains, returning the same functionality as that of young rats. Human trials are planned, starting with Parkinsons patients.<ref>{{cite news|last= Hamzelou |first= Jessica |date= 23 October 2015 |newspaper=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28384-old-rat-brains-rejuvenated-and-new-neurons-grown-by-asthma-drug| title=Old rat brains rejuvenated and new neurons grown by asthma drug|access-date=28 October 2015}}</ref> The researchers conducted the experiment with montelukast because it reduces inflammation in the lungs and they thought it might also reduce inflammation in the brain. Some research has suggested that decline in memory skills may be associated with inflammation in the brain.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yirka|first1=Bob|title=Asthma drug found to rejuvenate older rat brains|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-10-asthma-drug-rejuvenate-older-rat.html|website=medicalxpress.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref>

== Dosage and administration ==
The usual dose of montelukast in adults and teenagers is one 10&nbsp;mg tablet taken orally a day. In children 6 to 14 years of age the usual dosage is one 5&nbsp;mg chewable tablet a day.

==Patents==
Singulair was covered by U.S. Patent No. 5,565,473<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=5,565,473.PN.&OS=PN/5,565,473&RS=PN/5,565,473 5,565,473]</ref> which expired on August 3, 2012.<ref>[http://drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/patent/index.php?query=5,565,473 Singular patent details]</ref> The same day, the FDA approved several generic versions of montelukast.<ref>{{cite news|title=FDA approves first generic versions of Singulair to treat asthma, allergies|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm314436.htm|accessdate=15 August 2012|date=3 August 2012}}</ref>

The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] launched a [[reexamination]] of the patent covering Singulair on May 28, 2009.  The decision was driven by the discovery of references that were not included in the original patent application process.  The references were submitted through [[Article One Partners]], an online research community focused on finding literature relating to existing patents.  The references included a scientific article produced by a Merck employee on the active ingredient in Singulair.  A previously filed patent had been submitted in the same technology area.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/28/merck-singulair-idUSN2834535820090528 |title=U.S. Reexamines Merck's Singulair Patent |publisher=Thompson Reuters | date=May 28, 2009}}</ref> Seven months later the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the patent in question was valid based on the initial reexamination and new information provided, submitting their decision on December 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/17/merck-singulair-idUSWEN770820091217 |title=Merck Says U.S. Agency Upholds Singulair Patent |publisher=Thompson Reuters | date=December 17, 2009}}</ref>
