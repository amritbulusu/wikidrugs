'''Erlizumab''', also known as '''rhuMAb''', is a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[humanized monoclonal antibody]] that was an experimental [[immunosuppressive drug]]. Erlizumab was developed by [[Genentech]] under a partnership with [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]] to treat [[heart attack]], [[stroke]], and [[traumatic shock]].<ref name="genentech announces">{{cite news |title=Genentech Announces Phase II Trial of Experimental Anti-CD18 Antibody Did Not Meet Its Primary Objectives |work=[[Business Wire]] |date=June 16, 2000 |accessdate=January 29, 2009 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_June_16/ai_62759897}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==

The drug works by blocking a growth factor in blood vessels.<ref name="altman" /> Specifically, erlizumab targets [[CD18]] and an [[LFA-1]] integrin.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hehlgans |first=Stephanie |author2=Michael Haasea |author3=Nils Cordes |date=January 2007 |title=Signalling via integrins: Implications for cell survival and anticancer strategies  |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Reviews on Cancer |volume=1775 |issue=1 |pages=163&ndash;80 |doi=10.1016/j.bbcan.2006.09.001 |pmid=17084981}}</ref> Erlizumab was meant to stop lymphocyte movement into inflamed tissue, thereby reducing tissue damage.<ref name="dove">{{cite journal |last=Dove |first=Alan |year=2000 |title=CD18 trials disappoint again  |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=18 |pages=817&ndash;8 |doi=10.1038/78412 |pmid=10932141 |issue=8}}</ref>

== Clinical trials ==

Genentech started [[clinical trial]]s on the drug in October 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=Genentech Reports 1996 Third Quarter Results |work=[[Genentech]] |date=October 21, 1996 |accessdate=January 31, 2009 |url=http://www.gene.com/gene/news/press-releases/display.do?method=detail&id=4805}}</ref> During clinical trials, six patients suddenly started coughing up blood, and four of them later died.<ref name="altman">{{cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Altman |title=THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; In Search of Surprises as Cures for Cancer |work=[[The New York Times]] |page= |date=May 30, 2000 |accessdate=January 29, 2009 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E7DD163CF933A05756C0A9669C8B63}}</ref> In June 2000, preliminary phase II clinical trial results showed that erlizumab did not meet Genentech's goals.<ref name="genentech announces" /> Genentech's primary goal was for the drug to increase blood flow to the heart within 90 minutes of administering the medicine.<ref name="dove" />

== Other anti-CD18 drugs ==

Multiple companies have tried to develop anti-CD18 drugs, but none of them have been successful.<ref name="dove" /> Among them are [[Icos]]'s [[rovelizumab]] (LeukArrest), and two drugs developed by [[PDL BioPharma|Protein Design Labs]] and [[Centocor]].<ref name="dove" /> Although trials in humans have not gone well, the research of CD18 drugs in animals has been encouraging.<ref name="dove" /> It is thought that the experimental medicines are affecting the lymphocyte adhesion pathway in humans in unintended ways.<ref name="dove" /> One hypothesis is that the endothelial cell barrier function fails when blood supply is low for a prolonged time in humans.<ref name="barran">{{cite journal |last=Barran |first=Kenneth |author2=Michel Nguyen |author3=George R.
