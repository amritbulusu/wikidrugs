'''Nikethamide''' is a [[stimulant]] which mainly affects the respiratory cycle. Widely known by its former trade name of '''Coramine''', it was used in the mid-twentieth century as a medical countermeasure against [[tranquilizer]] [[Drug overdose|overdoses]], before the advent of endotracheal [[intubation]] and positive-pressure lung expansion. It is no longer commonly considered to be of value for such purposes.

In alternate terminology, it is known as ''nicotinic acid diethylamide'', which meaningfully emphasizes its laboratory origins, and of which its common name is derived as a [[Blend word|blend]].

== Former and current medical use ==
Coramine was used by suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams]] when treating patient [[Gertrude Hullett]], whom he was suspected of [[murder]]ing.<ref>Cullen, Pamela V., "A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams", London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904027-19-9}}</ref> However, the toxicity of nikethamide is quite low ({{LD50}} rabbits 650&nbsp;mg/kg oral, LD<sub>50</sub> rats 240&nbsp;mg/kg subcutaneous).

[[Theodor Morell]], [[Adolf Hitler]]'s personal physician, would inject the German ruler with Coramine when Hitler was unduly sedated with barbiturates.  In addition, Morell would use Coramine as part of an all-purpose "tonic" for Hitler.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Doyle D |date=February 2005 |title=Adolf Hitler's medical care |journal=J. R. Coll. Physicians Edinb. |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=75–82 |issn=1478-2715 |pmid=15825245 |oclc=49953788 |url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_35_1/Hitler's_medical_care.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref>

It is available as a short-acting [[over-the-counter drug]] in several South American and European countries, combined with glucose in form of lozenges. It is especially useful for mountain climbers to increase endurance at high altitudes. Contraindications include [[hypertension]], [[cardiovascular]] pathologies and [[epilepsy]].<ref>[http://www.toxcenter.de/stoff-infos/n/nikethamid.pdf Nikethamid], III-3.3, Toxcenter</ref>

== Use in sports ==
In some sports, nikethamide is listed by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] as a banned substance.  Croatian tennis player [[Marin Čilić]] was suspended from competition for nine months after he tested positive for nikethamide in April 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/24116444|title=Marin Cilic: Croatian banned for nine months|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 September 2013|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> This ban was later reduced to four months after Cilic appealed and claimed he had unintentionally ingested it in a glucose tablet bought at a pharmacy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/10/cilic-cleared-play-again-after-suspension-reduced/49565/#.UmqAnfmsiSo|title=Cilic cleared to play again after suspension reduced|work=[[Tennis (magazine)|Tennis]]|date=25 October 2013|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref> Polish [[kart]] driver Igor Walilko was given a two-year ban, later reduced to eighteen months, from competition in 2010 due to testing positive for nikethamide after a win in [[Germany]] in July, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/basicpage/file/10-10-11c-WALILKO-Decision-CAS.pdf |title=FIA ANTI‐DOPING DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE; Mr Igor WALILKO; Decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport |date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>
