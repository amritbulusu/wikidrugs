=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
Miltefosine is listed as pregnancy category D by the FDA. This means there is evidence-based adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans of harm to the human fetus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy-categories.html|title=New FDA Pregnancy Categories Explained - Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116163852/https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy-categories.html|archivedate=2016-11-16|df=}}</ref>  Despite this evidence, the potential benefits of miltefosine may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.  A pregnancy test should be done prior to starting treatment. Effective [[birth control]] should be used while on miltefosine and 5 months after discontinuation of treatment. Its use during breast feeding is most likely unsafe.<ref name="dorlo" />

==Contraindications==
Miltefosine is contraindicated in individuals who have a [[hypersensitivity]] to this medication, pregnant women, and people who have the [[Sjögren-Larsson syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Highlights of Prescribing Information for Impavido|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/204684s000lbl.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118193055/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/204684s000lbl.pdf|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}</ref> It is embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits, and [[teratogenic]] in rats but not in rabbits. It is therefore contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and [[contraception]] is required beyond the end of treatment in women of child-bearing age.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sindermann|first=H.|author2=Engel, J.|title=Development of miltefosine as an oral treatment for leishmaniasis|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2006|volume=100|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S17–S20|doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2006.02.010|pmid=16730362}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Common [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s from miltefosine treatment are [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], which occur in 60% of people. Other common side effects are dizziness, headache, and daytime sleepiness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/sfx/miltefosine-side-effects.html|title=Miltefosine Side Effects in Detail - Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117070506/https://www.drugs.com/sfx/miltefosine-side-effects.html|archivedate=2016-11-17|df=}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Miltefosine primarily acts on ''Leishmania'' by affecting the species promastigote and amastigote stages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/1311/impavido-miltefosine|title=Impavido New FDA Drug Approval {{!}} CenterWatch|website=www.centerwatch.com|access-date=2016-11-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104192249/http://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/1311/impavido-miltefosine|archivedate=2016-11-04|df=}}</ref> Miltefosine exerts its activity by interacting with lipids, inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase and causing apoptosis-like cell death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/Anti-InfectiveDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM371074.pdf|title=Miltefosine (Impravido) for the Treatment of Visceral, Mucosal and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis|last=FDA|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 Nov 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024125444/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/Anti-InfectiveDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM371074.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-24|df=}}</ref> This may affect membrane integrity and mitochondrial function of the parasite.

===Leishmaniasis===
In the same year as the discovery of the anticancer property, miltefosine was reported by S. L. Croft and his team at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] as having antileishmanial effect as well.

===Anti-HIV activity===

Miltefosine targets HIV infected [[macrophages]], which play a role [[in vivo]] as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. The HIV protein [[Structure and genome of HIV#Genome organization|Tat]] activates pro-survival [[PI3K]]/[[Akt]] pathway in primary human macrophages.  Miltefosine acts by inhibiting the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K/Akt pathway]], thus removing the infected macrophages from circulation, without affecting healthy cells.<ref name=pmid18237430>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chugh P, Bradel-Tretheway B, Monteiro-Filho CM, etal |title=Akt inhibitors as an HIV-1 infected macrophage-specific anti-viral therapy |journal=Retrovirology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=11 |year=2008 |pmid=18237430 |doi=10.1186/1742-4690-5-11 |pmc=2265748}}</ref><ref name="titleAIDSmeds.com - Top Stories : Parasitic Drug Shows HIV-Fighting Promise">{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsmeds.com/articles/hiv_miltefosine_macrophages_1667_13933.shtml |title=Parasitic Drug Shows HIV-Fighting Promise |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=2008-02-01 |publisher=AIDSmeds.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212122209/http://www.aidsmeds.com/articles/hiv_miltefosine_macrophages_1667_13933.shtml |archivedate=2008-02-12 |df= }}</ref> It significantly reduces replication of HIV-1 in cocultures of human [[dendritic cell]]s (DCs) and [[CD4(+) T cell|CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell]]s, which is due to a rapid secretion of soluble factors and is associated with induction of type-I [[interferon]] (IFN) in the human cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garg|first=Ravendra |author2=Tremblay, Michel J.|title=Miltefosine represses HIV-1 replication in human dendritic cell/T-cell cocultures partially by inducing secretion of type-I interferon|journal=Virology|year=2012|volume=432|issue=2|pages=271–276|doi=10.1016/j.virol.2012.05.032|pmid=22704066}}</ref>
