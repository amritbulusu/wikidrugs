== Medical uses ==

Cetacaine is an anesthetic that is a Benzocaine based drug that also contains other active ingredients that include Butamben and Tetracaine Hydrochloride.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |title=Cetacaine Topical Anesthetic - FDA prescribing information, side effects and uses |url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/cetacaine-topical-anesthetic.html |website=www.drugs.com |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref> The main use for this drug is to produce anesthesia to [[Mucous membrane|mucus membranes]] to numb and help control the pain in that area.<ref name=":2" /> The spray form of Cetacaine is also used to help prevent gagging in the patient.<ref name=":0" /> The anesthetic effect of Cetacaine can be expected to take effect in about 30 seconds and last between 30–60 minutes depending on location and application amount.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Cetacaine can and has been used for surgeries that include bronchi, ear, esophagus, larynx, mouth, nose, pharynx, rectal, and vaginal procedures.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> These procedures can include periodontal treatment, pre-probing, pre-scaling/root planning procedures, pre-injection, and laser dentistry.<ref name=":2" />

=== Application and dosage ===

The dosage should be applied directly to the site where anesthesia is required. The dosage should be modified according to the patient and there has not been a dosage specified for children.<ref name=":1" />

Spray: Cetacaine spray should be applied for only one second and dosage should not exceed an application spray longer than 2&nbsp;seconds.

Gel: Use a cotton swab to apply 200&nbsp;mg to the needed area and the dosage should not exceed 400&nbsp;mg.

Liquid: Apply 200&nbsp;mg either directly or by using cotton applicator to the location and the dosage should not exceed 400&nbsp;mg.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" />

=== Mechanism of action ===
Cetacaine acts quickly in about 30 seconds and can last between 30–60 minutes. This is due to Benzocaine causing the immediate anesthetic effect, while Butamben and Tetracaine Hydrochloride causes the extended effect of Cetacaine.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" />

==== Mechanism ====
The actual mechanism for the onset of anesthesia is unknown, but it is believed that the active ingredients reversibly block nerve conduction therefore causing the numbing sensation. This stabilizes the neuron and prevents signals from being transferred.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" />

==== Pharmacokinetics ====
The rate of absorption through the skin and after diffusing in and back out of the [[Nerve|nerve membrane]] it is metabolized by plasma [[cholinesterase]] and then excreted by urine.<ref name=":1" />

=== Adverse effects ===
Cetacaine has been known to cause adverse effects in the patients it has been administered to. These include [[hypersensitivity]] in the form of anaphylaxis, dermatitis, erythema, pruritus which can lead to oozing and vesiculation.<ref name=":3" />  There have also been accounts of rashes, edema, urticarial and other allergic symptoms as well as methemoglobinemia.<ref name=":1" /> Other adverse effects can include: tremors, twitching, dizziness, confusion, hypo-tension, vomiting, euphoria, and blurred or double vision.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |title=Cetacaine (benzocaine/butamben/tetracaine topical) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more. |url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/cetacaine-benzocaine-butamben-tetracaine-topical-999521#4 |website=reference.medscape.com |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>
