'''Interferon alfa''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''HuIFN-alpha-Le''', trade name '''Multiferon''', is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] composed of natural [[interferon alpha]] (IFN-α) obtained from the [[leukocyte]] fraction of human [[blood]] following induction with [[Sendai virus]]. [[Interferon]] alfa contains several naturally occurring IFN-α subtypes and is purified by [[affinity chromatography]]. Although the pharmaceutical product is often simply called "interferon alpha" or "IFN-α" like its [[endogeny|endogenous]] counterpart, the product's INN is interferon alfa (the spelling of 'alfa' with 'f' reflects INN naming conventions). 

== Composition ==
Interferon alfa contains a mixture of several [[protein]]s, all with structural, [[serology|serological]], and functional properties typical for natural [[Interferon type 1|interferon alpha]] (IFN α). The major subtypes identified are IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, IFN-α14 and IFN-α21. Of these, IFN-α2 and IFN-α14 are [[glycosylated]]. The IFN-α content is expressed in [[International Unit]]s per [[milliliter]], and the drug product is formulated in [[Tonicity|isotonic]] phosphate buffer solution at [[pH]] = 7.2, and supplemented with human [[albumin]] at 1.5&nbsp;mg/ml. The albumin used is a medicinal product approved in several countries, and is indicated for [[subcutaneous injection]] therapy.

== Pharmacology ==
IFN-α8 enhances the proliferation of human [[B cell]]s, as well as being able to activate [[natural killer cells|NK cells]]. The subtypes α10 and α2, along with α8, are the most efficient and powerful NK cell activators.
Subtypes α21 and α2 enhance the expression of [[Interferon gamma|IFN-gamma-inducible]] protein-10 (IP-10) in [[dendritic cell]]s. Activated dendritic cells initiate [[immune system|immune responses]] and induce the [[gene expression|expression]] of IP-10, a [[chemokine]] which promotes a [[T helper cell|Th1]] [[inflammation|inflammatory response]].

IFN-α1 causes increased [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA-II]] expression, and can directly inhibit [[tumor]] cell growth ''in vitro''. However, it is a poor activator of NK cells, has relatively little [[antiviral drugs|antiviral activity]], does not induce B cell proliferation, and does not enhance [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA-I]] or [[tumor antigen]] expression. Despite its apparent inactivity, it is still used clinically in the treatment of [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[renal cell carcinoma]], with a reported lower [[toxicity]] than the [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] IFN-α2. Overall, IFN-α has a general inflammatory action which skews the immune response towards a Th1 profile. 

Subtype α2 increases the expression of HLA-I molecules, which correlates with IFN-α-mediated activation of [[Memory T cells|memory CD8 cells]] and increased [[cytolysis|cytolytic]] action against [[virus|virally]] infected cells and tumor cells (via [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic CD8 cells]]).
