'''Levomethadone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; '''<small>L</small>-Polamidon''', '''<small>L</small>-Polamivet''', '''Levadone''', '''Levothyl'''), or '''levamethadone''', is a [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] and [[antitussive]] which is marketed in [[Europe]] and is used for [[pain management]] and in [[opioid replacement therapy|opioid maintenance therapy]].<ref name="Buschmann2002" /><ref name="Macdonald1997">{{cite book | author = F..

The separation of the stereoisomers is one of the easier in organic chemistry and is described in the original patent.  It involves "treatment of racemic methadone base with d-(+)-tartaric acid in an acetone/water mixture [which] precipitates almost solely the dextro-methadone levo-tartrate, and the more potent levo-methadone can easily be retrieved from the mother liquor in a high state of optical purity" <ref>https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/methadone.html</ref>

== Regulatory status ==
Levomethadone is listed under the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961 and is a Schedule II Narcotic controlled substance in the US as an isomer of methadone (ACSCN 9250) and is not listed separately, nor is dextromethadone.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html</ref>  It  is similarly controlled under the German [[Betäubungsmittelgesetz]] and similar laws in practically every other country.
