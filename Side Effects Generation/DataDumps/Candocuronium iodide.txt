==Background==
As with other  neuromuscular blocking agents, candocuronium preferentially antagonizes competitively the [[nicotinic]] subtype of  acetylcholine receptors.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Harvey AL, Paul D, Rodger IW, Singh H | title = Actions of the [[muscle relaxant]] chandonium iodide on guinea-pig ileum and vas deferens preparations | journal = J Pharm Pharmacol | year = 1976| volume = 28 | month = | issue = 8 | pages = 617–619 | pmid = 11309 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-7158.1976.tb02812.x}}</ref> The agent was developed by the laboratory of Harkishan Singh, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India, as part of the search for a non-depolarizing replacement for the most popular clinically used depolarizing agent, [[suxamethonium]] ([[succinylcholine]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Design of candocuronium==
The ''mono''- and ''bis''-quaternary azasteroid series of compounds to which candocuronium belongs are based on the same principle that led to aminosteroids such as [[pancuronium]], [[vecuronium]] and [[rocuronium]]: use of the steroid skeleton to provide a somewhat rigid distance between the two quaternary ammonium centers, with appendages incorporating fragments of choline or acetylcholine.  The discovery program initiated by Singh<ref name= Singh>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh H, Paul D | title = Steroids and related studies. XXV.

==Modifications at 3- and 16-positions of androstane nucleus==
The discovery of candocuronium led to numerous related neuromuscular blocking agents with short durations of action but also having attendant undesirable cardiovascular effects.
