'''Indane''' or '''indan''' is a [[hydrocarbon]] petrochemical compound, with formula C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>10</sub>.

==Derivatives==
Derivatives include compounds such as 1-methyl-indane and 2-methyl-indane (where one methyl group is attached to the five carbon ring), 4-methyl-indane and 5-methyl-indane (where one methyl group is attached to the benzene ring), various dimethyl-indanes, and various pharmaceutical derivatives.  Other derivatives can be obtained indirectly, e.g. the reaction of [[diethyl phthalate]] with [[ethyl acetate]], using metallic [[sodium]] and [[ethanol]] as a catalyst. The reaction yields indanedione ethyl ester, which can react with the sodium ions yielding a salt. This can be reversed by adding an aqueous solution of [[hydrochloric acid]].

Indane can also be converted in a catalytic reactor to other aromatics such as [[xylene]].

Another derivative is [[1,3-indandione]].

[[David E. Nichols|Dr. David E. Nichols]] developed a family of indane derivatives that are [[empathogen-entactogen]]s. They are very close derivatives of other empathogen-entactogens such as [[MDMA]] and [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]]. However, they are not [[neurotoxic]] at therapeutic doses because the alpha-methyl group is bound and therefore cannot form a [[free radical]]. Examples include [[MDAI]], [[MDMAI]], and [[MDAT]].<ref>Nichols DE, Brewster WK, Johnson MP, Oberlender R, Riggs RM. Nonneurotoxic tetralin and indan analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine (MDA). ''Journal of Medicinal Chemistry''. 1990 Feb;33(2):703-10. {{PMID|1967651}}</ref> Nichols also created an indane isomer of [[amphetamine]], [[2-aminoindane]], and an iodized derivative [[5-IAI]].

Indane is also known to be used in the synthesis of [[sulofenur]].<ref name="HowbertGrossman1990">{{cite journal|last1=Howbert|first1=J. Jeffry|last2=Grossman|first2=C.
