'''Dibenzylpiperazine''' ('''DBZP''') is a [[piperazine]] derivative often found as an impurity in the recreational [[stimulant]] drug [[benzylpiperazine]] (BZP).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Presence of DBZP is a marker for low quality or badly made BZP. It can be made as a reaction [[byproduct]] during BZP synthesis, either because the reaction has been run at too high a temperature, or because an excess of [[benzyl chloride]] has been used.

==Pharmacology and effects==
It is not known to have any stimulant effects in its own right, although this has not been tested.

==Toxicity==
The toxicity of DBZP is unknown.

==Legal status==

===China===

As of October 2015 DBZP is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

===United States===
DBZP is not scheduled as a [[controlled substance]] at the federal level in the [[United States]].<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm 21 CFR — Schedules of Controlled Substances §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref> It is possible that it could be considered an analog BZP, in which case, sales or possession intended for human consumption could be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analog Act]].

====Florida====
DBZP is a [[Schedule I controlled substance]] in the state of [[Florida]] making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.<ref name="Florida Statutes">{{cite web | url = http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/0893.html | title = Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - Drug Abuse Prevention and Control}}</ref>
