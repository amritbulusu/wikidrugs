'''Proxorphan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''proxorphan tartate''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) (developmental code name '''BL-5572M'''), is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] and [[antitussive]] [[drug]] of the [[morphinan]] family that was never marketed.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

==Synthesis==
[[File:Proxorphan synthesis.svg|thumb|700px|center|T. A. Montzka, J. D. Matiskella and R. A. Partyka, {{US patent|4246413}}; Chem. Abstr. 95, 43442z (1981).]]
Starting material for this preparation is ketoester '''1''', available by one of the classical benzomorphan syntheses.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/JR9470000399|title=81. Syntheses in the morphine series. Part I. Derivatives of bicyclo[3 : 3 : 1]-2-azanonane|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed)|pages=399|year=1947|last1=Barltrop|first1=J. A.}}</ref> Condensation with the [[ylide]] from [[Triethyl phosphonoacetate]] ([[HWE reaction]]) affords diester '''2'''. [[Catalytic hydrogenation]] proceeds from the less hindered face to afford the corresponding saturated diester ('''3'''). The esters are then reduced by means of [[LiAlH4]] to give the [[glycol]] ('''4'''); this undergoes internal ether formation on treatment with acid to form the [[pyran]] ring of '''5'''. [[Von Braun reaction]] with [[BrCN]] (or [[ethyl chloroformate]]) followed by [[saponification]] of the intermediate leads to the 2° amine ('''6'''). This is converted to the cyclopropylmethyl derivative '''8''' by acylation with [[cyclopropylcarbonyl chloride]]<ref>http://caod.oriprobe.com/articles/6521356/Synthesis_of_Cyclopropanecarbonyl_chloride.htm</ref><ref>{{US patent|5504245}}</ref> followed by reduction of the thus formed amide ('''7''') with [[LiAlH4]]. Cleave of the O-methyl ether with sodium [[Ethanethiol]] affords proxorphan ('''9''').
