'''Abbott Laboratories''' is a multinational [[health care]] company with headquarters in [[Lake Bluff]], [[Illinois]]. The company was founded by Chicago [[physician]] Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products.  It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into [[Abbvie]] in 2013.  In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.

Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health.  In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.

Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], founded the '''Abbott Alkaloidal Company'''. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a [[Herbalism|medicinal plant]], generally an [[alkaloid]] (e.g., [[morphine]], [[quinine]], [[strychnine]] and [[codeine]]), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Abbott-Laboratories-Company-History.html |title=Abbott Laboratories Company History |publisher=Funding Universe |date= |accessdate= April 17, 2013}}</ref>

Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in [[Pakistan]] as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in [[Karachi]] continue to produce pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com.pk/11_Aboutus.htm|title=About Us|publisher=}}</ref> Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in [[India]] for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently [[India]]'s largest healthcare products company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/abbott-india-and-the-extraordinary-future-it-is-building/1/215073.html|title=It's essential to be part of the extraordinary future India is building: Miles D.

According to Harvard professor [[Lester Grinspoon]] and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".<ref name="grinspoon23">{{cite book|last1=Grinspoon|first1=Lester|last2=Hedblom|first2=Peter|title=The Speed Culture: Amphetamine Use and Abuse in America|date=1975|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674831926|oclc=1362148|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LyStWcRD6QIC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=strasenburgh+prescription#v=onepage&q=strasenburgh%20prescription&f=false}}</ref>

In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.

In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed [[Niaspan]], which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and [[Advicor]], a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.

In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to [[General Electric]] for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the [[GE Healthcare]] business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.<ref>{{cite news | last=Layne | first=Rachel | last2=Lopatto | first2=Elizabeth | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aLKvFFqD3DQw | title=GE, Abbott End $8.13 Billion Diagnostic Sale Deal (Update2) | agency=Bloomberg News | date=July 11, 2007 }}</ref>

==Litigation==

===Humira===
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" ([[Adalimumab]]) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=af.37juYEPaQ |title=Cambridge Antibody Wins Lawsuit Against Abbott Labs (Update5) - Bloomberg |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)]] (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Depakote===

On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of [[Depakote]] for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.<ref name="doj">[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/May/12-civ-585.html Abbott Labs to Pay $1.5 Billion to Resolve Criminal & Civil Investigations of Off-label Promotion of Depakote], Press Release, [[United States Department of Justice]] Office of Public Affairs, May 7, 2012. Accessed Aug. 17 2014.</ref>

Abbott Laboratories, 1:08-cv-0054 (W.D. Va.); U.S. ex rel. Dietzler v. Abbott Laboratories, 1:09-cv-00051 (W.D. Va.); U.S. ex rel. Spetter v. Abbott Laboratories, 1:10-cv-00006 (W.D. Va.).</ref> The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law360.com/articles/516296/abbott-shareholders-agree-to-settle-depakote-marketing-suit |title=Abbott, Shareholders Agree To Settle Depakote Marketing Suit - Law360 |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
