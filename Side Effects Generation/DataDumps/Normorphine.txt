'''Normorphine''' is an [[opiate]] analogue, the N-demethylated derivative of [[morphine]], that was first described in the 1950s<ref>Journal of the American Chemistry Society 75,4963 (1953)</ref> when a large group of N-substituted morphine analogues were characterized for activity. The compound has relatively little opioid activity in its own right,<ref>Fraser HF, [[Abraham Wikler|Wikler A]], Van Horn GD, Eisenman AJ, Isbell H. Human pharmacology and addiction liability of normorphine. ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics''. 1958 Mar;122(3):359-69. {{PMID|13539761}}</ref><ref>Lasagna L, De Kornfeld TJ. Analgesic potency of normorphine in patients with postoperative pain. ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics''. 1958 Nov;124(3):260-3. {{PMID|13588540}}</ref> but is a useful intermediate which can be used to produce both [[opioid antagonist]]s such as [[nalorphine]], and also potent opioid agonists such as [[N-phenethylnormorphine]].<ref>Daniel Lednicer. Central Analgetics. (1982), p146. {{ISBN|0-471-08314-3}} </ref> It is also a major [[metabolite]] of morphine,<ref>Yeh SY. Urinary excretion of morphine and its metabolites in morphine-dependent subjects. ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics''. 1975 Jan;192(1):201-10. {{PMID|235634}}</ref> with its formation from morphine catalyzed by the [[liver]] [[enzyme]]s [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2C8]].<ref>Projean D, Morin PE, Tu TM, Ducharme J. Identification of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 as the major cytochrome P450 s responsible for morphine N-demethylation in human liver microsomes. ''Xenobiotica''. 2003 Aug;33(8):841-54. {{PMID|12936704}}</ref>

Normorphine is a controlled substance listed under the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961 and the laws in various states implementing it; for example, in the United States it is a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance, with an ACSCN of 9313 and an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 18 grammes in 2014, unchanged from the prior year.  The salts in use are the free base hexahydrate (free base conversion ratio 0.715), and hydrochloride (0.833).<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>
