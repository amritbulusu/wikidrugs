'''Pizotifen''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''pizotyline''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), trade name  '''Sandomigran''', is a [[Benzocycloheptenes|benzocycloheptene]]-based drug used as a medicine, primarily as a preventative to reduce the frequency of recurrent [[migraine]] headaches.<ref>Stark RJ, Valenti L, Miller GC. Management of migraine in Australian general practice. Medical Journal of Australia. 2007 Aug 6;187(3):142-6.</ref>

==Uses==
The main medical use for pizotifen is for the prevention of [[vascular headache]] including [[migraine]] and [[cluster headache]]. Pizotifen is one of a range of medications used for this purpose, other options include [[propranolol]], [[topiramate]], [[valproic acid]] and [[amitriptyline]]. While pizotifen is reasonably effective,<ref>Barnes N, Millman G. Do pizotifen or propranolol reduce the frequency of migraine headache? Archives of Disease in Childhood. 2004 Jul;89(7):684-5.</ref> its use is limited by side effects, principally drowsiness and weight gain, and it is usually not the first choice medicine for preventing migraines, instead being used as an alternative when other drugs have failed to be effective.<ref>Pierangeli G, Cevoli S, Sancisi E, Grimaldi D, Zanigni S, Montagna P, Cortelli P. Which therapy for which patient? Neurological Sciences. 2006 May;27 Suppl 2:S153-8.</ref> It is not effective in relieving migraine attacks once in progress. Pizotifen has also been reported as highly effective in a severe case of erythromelalgia, a rare neurovascular disease that is sometimes refractory to the other drugs named above.<ref>Cohen JS. Erythromelalgia: new theories and new therapies. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2000 Nov;43(5 Pt 1):841-7</ref>

Other applications for which pizotifen may be used include as an [[antidepressant]], or for the treatment of [[anxiety]] or [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]].<ref>Standal JE. Pizotifen as an antidepressant. [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]]. 1977 Oct;56(4):276-9.</ref><ref>Banki CM. Clinical observations with pizotifene (Sandomigran) in the treatment of nonmigrainous depressed women. Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten. 1978 Mar 7;225(1):67-72.</ref> Animal studies also suggest that pizotyline could be used in the treatment of [[serotonin syndrome]] or [[MDMA]] [[overdose]]<ref>Young R, Khorana N, Bondareva T, Glennon RA. Pizotyline effectively attenuates the stimulus effects of N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA). Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior. 2005 Oct;82(2):404-10.</ref> in a similar manner to the closely related antihistamine/antiserotonin drug [[cyproheptadine]].

==Adverse effects==
[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effects]] include [[sedation]], [[dry mouth]], drowsiness, increased appetite and weight gain.<ref>Crowder D, Maclay WP. Pizotifen once daily in the prophylaxis of migraine: results of a multi-centre general practice study. Current Medical Research and Opinion. 1984;9(4):280-5.</ref> Occasionally it may cause nausea, headaches, or dizziness. In rare cases, anxiety, aggression and depression may also occur.

==Contraindications==
Caution is required in patients having closed angle glaucoma and in patients with a predisposition to urinary retention as the drug exhibits a relatively small anticholinergic effect. Dose adjustment is required in patients having renal insufficiency. Hepatic injury has also been reported. Pizotifen treatment should be discontinued if there is any clinical evidence of hepatic dysfunction during treatment.Caution is advised in patients having a history of epilepsy.
Withdrawal symptoms like depression, tremor, nausea, anxiety, malaise, dizziness, sleep disorder and weight decrease have been reported following abrupt cessation of pizotifen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/14045/SPC/SANOMIGRAN+1.5mg+Tablets|title=Emedicine}}</ref>
Pizotifen is contraindicated in patients who suffer from hypersensitivity to any of its components, also Pizotifen is contraindicated in  gastric outlet obstruction, pregnancy, angle-closure glaucoma and difficulty urinating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lekarstwo.ru/en/preparati/pizotifen.html|title=Likarstwo.ru}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Pizotifen is a [[serotonin antagonist]] acting mainly at the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2C receptor|5HT<sub>2C</sub>]] [[serotonin receptor|receptors]]. It also has some activity as an [[antihistamine]] as well as some anticholinergic activity.<ref>Dixon AK, Hill RC, Roemer D, Scholtysik G. Pharmacological properties of 4-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidine)-9,10-dihydro-4H-benzo-[4,5]cyclohepta[1,2]-thiophene hydrogen maleate (pizotifen). Arzneimittelforschung. 1977;27(10):1968-79.</ref>
