'''Propanidid''' is an ultra short-acting [[phenylacetic acid|phenylacetate]] [[general anesthetic]].  It was originally introduced by [[Bayer]] in 1963<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | status = patent | number = 3086978 | inventor = Hiltmann, R.; Wollweber, H.; Hoffmeister, F.; Wirth, W. | title = 3-Methoxy-4-Carbamidomethoxy-Phenylacetic Acid Esters | gdate = 1963-04-23 | assign1 = Bayer }}</ref> but [[anaphylactic reaction]]s caused it to be withdrawn shortly afterwards.

Even though [[Cremophor EL]] has been shown to cause anaphylactic reactions in humans in several cases (both when given intravenously and orally), it is still debated whether or not propanidid itself may have contributed to the reactions.

It has been argued that the toxic effects or reactions to propanidid (and [[Althesin]]) were due to the drugs themselves.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Clarke, R. S. |author2=Dundee, J.

This suggest that the negative reactions were mainly caused by Cremophor and not by the drug substances themselves.
