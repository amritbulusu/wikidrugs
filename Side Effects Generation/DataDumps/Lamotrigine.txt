'''Lamotrigine''', originally marketed as '''Lamictal''' and available under many brands worldwide,<ref name=brands/> is an [[anticonvulsant]] drug used in the treatment of [[epilepsy]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. For epilepsy, it is used to treat [[focal seizure]]s, primary and secondary [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s, and seizures associated with [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]]. Like the anticonvulsant medications [[carbamazepine]] and [[valproate]], lamotrigine also seems to act as an effective [[mood stabilizer]], and was the first U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)-approved drug for this purpose since [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]], a drug approved almost 30 years earlier. It is approved for the maintenance treatment of [[Bipolar II disorder|bipolar type II]].

Lamotrigine is a [[phenyltriazine]], making it chemically distinct from other approved anticonvulsants. It enhances the action of [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS; which consists of the brain and spinal cord).<ref>{{cite web| url= https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3878#section=Top| title= Lamotrigine| website= PubChem Open Chemistry Database| publisher= National Institutes of Health| location= US| access-date= December 13, 2016}}</ref> Lamotrigine may also inhibit voltage-gated [[sodium channel]]s thereby suppressing the release of [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]], two of the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the CNS.<ref>{{cite web|title=DailyMed - LAMOTRIGINE - lamotrigine chewable dispersible tablet, for suspension|url=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=05cba628-b12c-44d8-89a8-3522fe417cc1|website=DailyMed|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref> It is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of [[antiepileptic drugs]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Rogawski MA, Löscher W | title = The neurobiology of antiepileptic drugs | journal = Nat Rev Neurosci | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 553–564 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15208697 | doi=10.1038/nrn1430}}</ref> but it could have additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as [[phenytoin]] and [[carbamazepine]] and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its [[sigma receptor]] activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasises its unique properties.<ref name= pmid7687190>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lees G, Leach MJ | title = Studies on the mechanism of action of the novel anticonvulsant lamotrigine (Lamictal) using primary neurological cultures from rat cortex | journal = Brain Research | volume = 612 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 190–9 | date = May 1993 | pmid = 7687190 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(93)91660-K| url = }}</ref> Lamotrigine is inactivated by [[glucuronidation]] in the [[liver]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/TCRM.S3343 |author= Werz MA |title= Pharmacotherapeutics of epilepsy: use of lamotrigine and expectations for lamotrigine extended release |journal= Ther Clin Risk Manag |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1035–46 |date=October 2008|pmid= 19209284 |pmc=2621406}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==

=== Epilepsy ===

Lamotrigine is approved in the [[United States|US]] for the treatment of [[partial seizure]]s.<ref name="anonymous"/> It is considered a first-line drug for primary generalised [[tonic-clonic seizures]] (includes simple partial, complex partial and secondarily generalised seizures), and as an [[adjuvant therapy]] in partial seizures (focal onset tonic-clonic, atypical absence, [[myoclonic]], and due to [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]]). As well, it is used as an alternative drug for [[absence seizure]] and atypical absence, myoclonic, and [[atonic seizures]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Kasper | first=D | editor= Fauci AS |editor2=Braunwald E|title= eds.

Lamotrigine is one of a small number of FDA-approved therapies for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of [[epilepsy]]. Typically developing before four years of age, LGS is associated with developmental delays. There is no cure, treatment is often complicated, and complete recovery is rare. Symptoms include the atonic seizure (also known as a "drop attack"), during which brief loss of [[muscle tone]] and consciousness cause abrupt falls. Lamotrigine significantly reduces the frequency of LGS seizures, and is one of two medications known to decrease the severity of drop attacks.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000123695.22623.32  |vauthors=French JA, Kanner AM, Bautista J, etal |title=Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment of refractory epilepsy: report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee and Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society |journal=Neurology |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=1261–73 |date=April 2004|pmid=15111660 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/full/62/8/1261}}</ref> Combination with [[valproate]] is common, but this increases the risk of lamotrigine-induced [[rash]], and necessitates reduced dosing due to the interaction of these drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.104.5.1106 |author=Pellock JM |title=Managing pediatric epilepsy syndromes with new antiepileptic drugs |journal=Pediatrics |volume=104 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1106–16 |date=November 1999|pmid=10545555 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/104/5/1106}}</ref>

=== Bipolar disorder ===
Lamotrigine is approved in the US for maintenance treatment of [[bipolar I disorder]] and [[bipolar II disorder]].<ref name="GlaxoSmithKline, 2003"/><ref>https://www.fda.gov/downloads/advisorycommittees/committeesmeetingmaterials/pediatricadvisorycommittee/ucm235547.pdf</ref> While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly [[antimanic agent|antimanics]], lamotrigine is most effective for preventing the recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder.

A 2013 review about lamotrigine concluded that it is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent and that more research is needed in regards to its role in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and unipolar depression. Furthermore, no information to recommend its use in other psychiatric disorders was found.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.4088/JCP.12r08046| last= Reid |first=JG|author2=Gitlin MJ |author3=Altshuler LL  |title= Lamotrigine in psychiatric disorders |journal = J Clin Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=675–84 |date=July 2013|pmid= 23945444 }}</ref>

Not all rashes that occur while taking lamotrigine progress to SJS or TEN. Between 5 and 10% of patients will develop a rash, but only one in a thousand patients will develop a serious rash.   Rash and other skin reactions are more common in children, so this medication is often reserved for adults. For patients whose lamotrigine has been stopped after development of a rash, re-challenge with lamotrigine is also a viable option. However, it is not applicable for very serious cases.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Serrani Azcurra|first1=DJ|title=Lamotrigine rechallenge after a skin rash.

There is also an increased incidence of these eruptions in patients who are currently on, or recently discontinued a [[valproate]]-type anticonvulsant drug, as these medications interact in such a way that the clearance of both is decreased and the effective dose of lamotrigine is increased.<ref name="GSKprescribing"/>

== Mechanism of action ==

Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent [[sodium channels]], lamotrigine inhibited the release of [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]] evoked by the sodium-channel activator [[veratrine]] and was less effective in the inhibition of [[acetylcholine]] or [[GABA]] release. At high concentrations, it had no effect on spontaneous or [[potassium]] evoked amino acid release.<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov"/>

These studies suggested that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on [[voltage-gated sodium channels]] to decrease [[glutamate]] release. Several electrophysiological studies have investigated the effects of lamotrigine on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant in the treatment of human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These and a variety of other results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like that of [[phenytoin]] and [[carbamazepine]], is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to be protective against generalised [[absence epilepsy]] and other generalised epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalised [[tonic–clonic]] seizures, [[juvenile myoclonic epilepsy]], and [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]].

The basis for this broader spectrum of activity of lamotrigine is unknown, but could relate to actions of the drug on [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|voltage-activated calcium channels]]. Lamotrigine blocks T-type [[calcium channels]] weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high-voltage–activated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined.
