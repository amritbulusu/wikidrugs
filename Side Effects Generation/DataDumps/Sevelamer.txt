'''Sevelamer''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]]) ({{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|ˈ|v|ɛ|l|əm|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|ˈ|v|ɛ|l|əm|ɪər}}) is a [[phosphate binder|phosphate binding]] drug used to treat [[hyperphosphataemia|hyperphosphatemia]] in patients with [[chronic kidney disease]]. When taken with meals, it binds to dietary phosphate and prevents its absorption. Sevelamer was invented and developed by [[GelTex Pharmaceuticals]]. Sevelamer is currently marketed by [[Sanofi]] under the trade names '''Renagel''' (sevelamer [[hydrochloride]]) and '''Renvela''' (sevelamer [[carbonate]]).

==Chemistry and pharmacology==
Sevelamer consists of [[polyallylamine]] that is crosslinked with [[epichlorohydrin]].<ref>(1) Rosenbaum, D. P.; Mandeville, W. H.; Pitruzzello, M.; Goldberg, D. I. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation Effect of RenaGel A, a Non-Absorbable, Cross-Linked, Polymeric Phosphate Binder, on Urinary Phosphorus Excretion in Rats. 1997, 961–964.</ref> The marketed form '''sevelamer hydrochloride''' is a partial hydrochloride salt being present as approximately 40% [[amine]] [[hydrochloride]] and 60% sevelamer base. The amine groups of sevelamer become partially [[proton]]ated in the intestine and interact with phosphate ions through [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[hydrogen bond]]ing.

==Medical uses==
Sevelamer is used in the management of [[hyperphosphatemia]] in adult patients with stage 4 and 5 [[chronic kidney disease]] on hemodialysis. Its efficacy at lowering phosphate levels is similar to that of calcium acetate, but without the accompanying risk of [[hypercalcemia]].

==Contraindications==
Sevelamer therapy is contraindicated in [[hypophosphatemia]] or bowel obstruction. In hypophosphatermia, sevelamer could exacerbate the condition by further lowering phosphate levels in the blood, which could be fatal.

==Adverse effects==
Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) associated with the use of sevelamer include: [[hypotension]], [[hypertension]], nausea and vomiting, [[dyspepsia]], [[diarrhea]], [[flatulence]], and/or [[constipation]].

==Other effects==
Sevelamer can significantly reduce serum [[uric acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garg JP, Chasan-Taber S, Blair A, etal | title = Effects of sevelamer and calcium-based phosphate binders on uric acid concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a randomized clinical trial| journal = Arthritis and rheumatism | volume = 52| issue = 1| pages = 290–5|date=January 2005| pmid = 15641045| doi = 10.1002/art.20781| url = | issn = }}</ref> This reduction has no known detrimental effect and several beneficial effects, including reducing [[hyperuricemia]], [[uric acid nephrolithiasis]], and [[gout]].

Sevelamer is able to sequester advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the gut,  preventing their absorption into the blood. AGEs contribute to [[oxidative stress]], which can damage cells (like [[beta cell|beta cells]], which produce [[insulin]] in the [[pancreas]]). As Vlassara and Uribarri explain in a 2014 review on AGEs, this may explain why sevelamer, but not [[calcium carbonate]] (a phosphate binder that ''does not'' sequester AGEs), has been shown to lower AGEs in the blood, as well as oxidative stress and [[acute-phase protein|inflammatory markers]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlassara H, Uribarri J | title = Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE) and Diabetes: Cause, Effect, or Both? | journal = J. Curr Diab Rep | volume = 14 | issue = 453 | doi = 10.1007/s11892-013-0453-1}}</ref>
