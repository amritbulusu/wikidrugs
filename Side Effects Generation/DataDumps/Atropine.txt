== Medical uses ==
[[File:Atropine injection ampoule.JPG|thumb|An [[ampoule]] containing atropine injection 1mL/0.5mg.]]

=== Eyes ===
[[Topical]] atropine is used as a [[cycloplegic]], to temporarily paralyze the [[accommodation reflex]], and as a [[mydriatic]], to dilate the [[pupil]]s. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic [[mydriatic]], whereas [[tropicamide]] (a shorter-acting [[cholinergic]] antagonist) or [[phenylephrine]] (an α-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] examination.

In refractive and accommodative [[amblyopia]], when occlusion is not appropriate sometimes atropine is given to induce blur in the good eye.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Georgievski Z, Koklanis K, Leone J | year = 2008 | title = Fixation behavior in the treatment of amblyopia using atropine | url = | journal = Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology | volume = 36 | issue = Suppl 2| pages = A764–A765 }}</ref> Evidence suggests that atropine penalization is just as effective as occlusion in improving visual acuity.<ref name="Li">{{cite journal |vauthors=Li T, Shotton K |title= Conventional occlusion versus pharmacologic penalization for amblyopia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=4 |pages= CD006460 |date=2009 |pmid= 19821369|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD006460.pub2 |pmc=3804306}}</ref>

Atropine eye drops have been shown to be effective in slowing the progression of myopia in children in several studies, but it is not available for this use, and side effects would limit its use.<ref name="Walline">{{cite journal |vauthors=Walline JJ, Lindsley K, Vedula SS, Cotter SA, Mutti DO, Twelker JD |title= Interventions to slow progression of myopia in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|issue=12 |pages=CD004916 |date=2011 |pmid= 22161388|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD004916.pub3 |pmc=4270373}}</ref>

=== Heart ===
[[Injection (medicine)|Injection]]s of atropine are used in the treatment of [[bradycardia]] (a heart rate < 60 beats per minute).

Atropine was previously included in international resuscitation guidelines for use in cardiac arrest associated with [[asystole]] and [[pulseless electrical activity|PEA]], but was removed from these guidelines in 2010 due to a lack of evidence for its effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Field JM, Hazinski MF, Sayre MR |title=Part 1: executive summary: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S640–56 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20956217 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970889 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/122/18_suppl_3/S640 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114164002/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/122/18_suppl_3/S640 |archivedate=2010-11-14 |df= }}</ref>  For symptomatic bradycardia, the usual dosage is 0.5 to 1&nbsp;mg IV push, may repeat every 3 to 5 minutes up to a total dose of 3&nbsp;mg (maximum 0.04&nbsp;mg/kg).<ref>* {{cite book | first =Bledsoe | last =Bryan E | authorlink = |author2=Robert S.

Atropine is also useful in treating [[Second-degree AV block#Types|second-degree heart block Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach block)]], and also [[Third-degree AV block|third-degree heart block]] with a high [[Purkinje fibers|purkinje]] or [[Atrioventricular node|AV-nodal]] [[escape rhythm]].  It is usually not effective in [[Second degree AV block#Type 2 Second-degree AV block|second-degree heart block Mobitz type 2]], and in [[Third-degree AV block|third-degree heart block]] with a low Purkinje or ventricular escape rhythm.

Atropine has also been used in an effort to prevent a low heart rate during [[intubation]] of children; however, evidence does not support this use.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Caen|first1=AR|last2=Berg|first2=MD|last3=Chameides|first3=L|last4=Gooden|first4=CK|last5=Hickey|first5=RW|last6=Scott|first6=HF|last7=Sutton|first7=RM|last8=Tijssen|first8=JA|last9=Topjian|first9=A|last10=van der Jagt|first10=ÉW|last11=Schexnayder|first11=SM|last12=Samson|first12=RA|title=Part 12: Pediatric Advanced Life Support: 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|date=3 November 2015|volume=132|issue=18 Suppl 2|pages=S526-42|pmid=26473000|doi=10.1161/cir.0000000000000266}}</ref>

=== Secretions ===
Atropine's actions on the parasympathetic nervous system inhibit salivary and mucus glands. The drug may also inhibit sweating via the sympathetic nervous system.  This can be useful in treating [[hyperhidrosis]], and can prevent the [[death rattle]] of dying patients. Even though atropine has not been officially indicated for either of these purposes by the FDA, it has been used by physicians for these purposes.<ref>[http://www.eperc.mcw.edu/EPERC/FastFactsIndex/ff_109.htm Death Rattle and Oral Secretions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414033606/http://www.eperc.mcw.edu/EPERC/FastFactsIndex/ff_109.htm |date=2014-04-14 }}</ref>

=== Poisonings ===
Atropine is not an actual [[antidote]] for [[organophosphate poisoning]]. However, by blocking the action of [[acetylcholine]] at [[muscarinic]] receptors, atropine also serves as a treatment for poisoning by [[organophosphate]] [[insecticide]]s and [[nerve gas]]es, such as [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] (GA), [[sarin]] (GB), [[soman]] (GD) and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]]. Troops who are likely to be attacked with [[chemical weapon]]s often carry [[autoinjector]]s with atropine and [[obidoxime]], for rapid injection into the muscles of the thigh.  In a developed case of nerve-gas poisoning, maximum  atropinization is desirable. Atropine is often used in conjunction with [[pralidoxime chloride]].

Atropine is given as a treatment for [[SLUDGE syndrome]] ([[salivation]], [[lacrimation]], [[urination]], [[diaphoresis]], [[gastrointestinal motility]], [[emesis]]) symptoms caused by organophosphate poisoning.  Another mnemonic is DUMBBELSS, which stands for diarrhea, urination, miosis, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, excitation (as of muscle in the form of fasciculations and CNS), lacrimation, salivation, and sweating (only sympathetic innervation using muscarinic receptors).

Some of the nerve agents attack and destroy [[acetylcholinesterase]] by [[phosphorylation]], so the action of acetylcholine becomes excessive and prolonged. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) can be effective against organophosphate poisoning because it can re-cleave this phosphorylation.  Atropine can be used to reduce the effect of the poisoning by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which would otherwise be overstimulated, by excessive acetylcholine accumulation.

==Side-effects==
Adverse reactions to atropine include ventricular [[fibrillation]], supraventricular or ventricular [[tachycardia]], [[Vertigo (medical)|dizziness]], [[nausea]], blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, [[photophobia]], dry mouth and potentially extreme [[confusion]], deliriant [[hallucination]]s and [[Psychomotor agitation|excitation]] especially amongst the elderly.  Most of available ampules are carried on sulphate which can cause histamine release and anaphylaxis to susceptible patients or patients with allergy to sulpha products. These latter effects are because atropine is able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]]. Because of the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] properties, some have used the drug [[recreational drugs|recreationally]], though this is potentially dangerous and often unpleasant{{mcn|date=December 2015}}.

In overdoses, atropine is [[poison]]ous. Atropine is sometimes added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly anti-diarrhea opioid drugs such as [[diphenoxylate]] or [[difenoxin]], wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the atropine can also aid the anti-diarrhea effects.

Although atropine treats [[bradycardia]] (slow heart rate) in emergency settings, it can cause paradoxical heart rate slowing when given at very low doses (i.e. <0.5&nbsp;mg),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/atropine-drug-information?source=search_result&search=atropine&selectedTitle=1~150 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220062212/http://www.uptodate.com/contents/atropine-drug-information?source=search_result&search=atropine&selectedTitle=1~150 |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}</ref> presumably as a result of central action in the CNS.<ref>* {{cite book |vauthors=Rang HP, Dale MM, Ritter JM, Flower RJ | year = 2007| title =  Rang and Dale's Pharmacology | chapter = Ch. 10| edition = | page = 153 | publisher = Elsevier Churchill Livingstone| location = | isbn = 0-443-06911-5| url = }}</ref> One proposed mechanism for atropine's paradoxical bradycardia effect at low doses involves blockade of inhibitory presynaptic muscarinic [[autoreceptor]]s, thereby blocking a system that inhibits the parasympathetic response.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laurence|first=Brunton|title=Goodman & Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12th Edition|date=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-162442-8}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Atropine is [[contraindicated]] in patients pre-disposed to narrow angle [[glaucoma]].{{mcn|date=November 2014}}

==Mechanism of action==
In general, atropine counters the "rest and digest" activity of [[gland]]s regulated by the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. This occurs because atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist of the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s ([[acetylcholine]] being the main [[neurotransmitter]] used by the parasympathetic nervous system).

Atropine is a competitive antagonist of the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]] types M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5.<ref>Rang, Dale, Ritter and More: Pharmacology, p. 139. Elsevier 2003.</ref> It is classified as an [[anticholinergic drug]] ([[parasympatholytic]]).

In cardiac uses, it works as a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholinergic antagonist, increasing firing of the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA) and conduction through the [[atrioventricular node]] (AV) of the [[heart]], opposes the actions of the [[vagus nerve]], blocks [[acetylcholine]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] sites, and decreases [[bronchial]] [[secretion]]s.{{Mcn|date=November 2014}}

In the eye, atropine induces [[mydriasis]] by blocking contraction of the circular [[pupillary sphincter]] muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial [[pupillary dilator]] [[muscle]] to contract and dilate the [[pupil]]. Atropine induces [[cycloplegia]] by paralyzing the [[ciliary muscle]]s, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with [[iridocyclitis]], and treats ciliary block (malignant) [[glaucoma]]. {{mcn|date=November 2014}}

==Chemistry and pharmacology==
Atropine is a [[enantiomer]]ic mixture of ''[[Levorotation and dextrorotation|d]]''-[[hyoscyamine]] and ''l''-hyoscyamine, with most of its physiological effects due to ''l''-hyoscyamine. Its pharmacological effects are due to binding to muscarinic [[acetylcholine receptor]]s. It is an antimuscarinic agent. Significant levels are achieved in the CNS within 30 minutes to 1 hour and disappears rapidly from the blood with a half-life of 2 hours. About 60% is excreted unchanged in the urine, most of the rest appears in urine as hydrolysis and conjugation products. Effects on the iris and ciliary muscle may persist for longer than 72 hours.

The most common atropine compound used in medicine is atropine [[sulfate]] (monohydrate) ([[carbon|C]]<sub>17</sub>[[hydrogen|H]]<sub>23</sub>[[Nitrogen|N]][[Oxygen|O]]<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·[[sulfuric acid|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]]·[[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]], the full chemical name is 1α H, 5α H-Tropan-3-α ol (±)-tropate(ester), sulfate monohydrate.

The vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that innervate the heart release acetylcholine (ACh) as their primary neurotransmitter. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors (M2) that are found principally on cells comprising the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Muscarinic receptors are coupled to the Gi-protein; therefore, vagal activation decreases cAMP. Gi-protein activation also leads to the activation of KACh channels that increase potassium efflux and hyperpolarizes the cells.

Increases in vagal activities to the SA node decreases the firing rate of the pacemaker cells by decreasing the slope of the pacemaker potential (phase 4 of the action potential); this decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy). The change in phase 4 slope results from alterations in potassium and calcium currents, as well as the slow-inward sodium current that is thought to be responsible for the pacemaker current (If). By hyperpolarizing the cells, vagal activation increases the cell's threshold for firing, which contributes to the reduction in the firing rate. Similar electrophysiological effects also occur at the AV node; however, in this tissue, these changes are manifested as a reduction in impulse conduction velocity through the AV node (negative dromotropy). In the resting state, there is a large degree of vagal tone on the heart, which is responsible for low resting heart rates.

There is also some vagal innervation of the atrial muscle, and to a much lesser extent, the ventricular muscle. Vagus activation, therefore, results in modest reductions in atrial contractility (inotropy) and even smaller decreases in ventricular contractility.

Muscarinic receptor antagonists bind to muscarinic receptors thereby preventing ACh from binding to and activating the receptor. By blocking the actions of ACh, muscarinic receptor antagonists very effectively block the effects of vagal nerve activity on the heart. By doing so, they increase heart rate and conduction velocity.

== History ==
''Mandragora'' ([[mandrake]]) was described by [[Theophrastus]] in the fourth century B.C. for treatment of wounds, gout, and sleeplessness, and as a love [[potion]]. By the first century A.D. [[Dioscorides]] recognized wine of mandrake as an [[anaesthetic]] for treatment of pain or sleeplessness, to be given prior to surgery or cautery.<ref name="holzman" />  The use of [[Solanaceae]] containing [[tropane]] [[alkaloid]]s for anesthesia, often in combination with [[opium]], persisted throughout the Roman and Islamic Empires and continued in Europe until superseded by the use of [[ether]], [[chloroform]], and other modern anesthetics.

Atropine extracts from the Egyptian [[henbane]] were used by [[Cleopatra]] in the last century B.C. to dilate her [[pupils]], in the hope that she would appear more alluring.  In the [[Renaissance]], women used the juice of the berries of ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'' to enlarge the pupils of their eyes, for cosmetic reasons. This practice resumed briefly in the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century in Paris.

The mydriatic effects of atropine were studied among others by the [[Germany|German]] [[chemistry|chemist]] [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]] (1795–1867). In 1831, the German pharmacist Heinrich F. G. Mein (1799-1864)<ref>[http://www.ostfriesischelandschaft.de/fileadmin/php/side.php?news_id=997&part_id=0&navi=11 Biography of Heinrich Friedrich Georg Mein (1799-1864)] (in German).</ref> succeeded in preparing atropine in pure crystalline form.<ref>Heinrich Friedrich Georg Mein (1831) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tT09AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false "Ueber die Darstellung des Atropins in weissen Kristallen"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515150443/https://books.google.com/books?id=tT09AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA67 |date=2016-05-15 }} (On the preparation of atropine as white crystals), ''Annalen der Pharmacie'', '''6'''(1):  67-72.<br>
Atropine was also independently isolated in 1833 by Geiger and Hesse:

== Natural sources ==
[[File:Atropa bella-donna0.jpg|thumb|left|''Atropa belladonna'']]
Atropine is found in many members of the [[Solanaceae]] family. The most commonly found sources are ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', ''[[Datura innoxia]]'', ''[[Datura metel|D. metel]]'', and ''[[Datura stramonium|D. stramonium]]''. Other sources include members of the ''[[Brugmansia]]'' and ''[[Hyoscyamus]]'' genera.

==Synthesis==
Atropine can be synthesized by the reaction of [[tropine]] with [[tropic acid]] in the presence of hydrochloric acid.

===Biosynthesis===
[[File:Biosynthesis of atropine.jpg|thumb|Biosynthesis of atropine starting from L-Phenylalanine]]

The biosynthesis of atropine starting from [[Phenylalanine|''l''-phenylalanine]] first undergoes a [[transamination]] forming [[phenylpyruvic acid]] which is then reduced to phenyl-lactic acid.<ref name=dewick>Dewick, Paul M. (2009). Medicinal natural products: A biosynthetic approach (3rd ed.). Chichester: A John Wiley & Sons. {{ISBN|978-0470741672}}</ref>  Coenzyme A then couples phenyl-lactic acid with [[tropine]] forming [[littorine]], which then undergoes a radical rearrangement initiated with a [[P450|P450 enzyme]] forming hyoscyamine aldehyde.<ref name=dewick/>  A [[dehydrogenase]] then reduces the aldehyde to a primary alcohol making (−)-hyoscyamine, which upon racemization forms atropine.<ref name=dewick/>

==Name==
The species name "belladonna" ("beautiful woman" in [[Italian language|Italian]]) comes from the original use of deadly nightshade to dilate the pupils of the eyes for cosmetic effect. Both atropine and the genus name for deadly nightshade derive from [[Atropos]], one of the three [[Moirai|Fates]] who, according to Greek mythology, chose how a person was to die.
