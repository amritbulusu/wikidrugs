Like [[cetuximab]], nimotuzumab binds to the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), a signalling protein that normally controls cell division. In some cancers, this receptor is altered to cause uncontrolled cell division, a hallmark of cancer. These monoclonal antibodies block EGFR and stop the uncontrolled cell division. 

It has a [[Humanized antibody|humanized]] human-mouse h-R3 [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]] and a humanized human-mouse h-R3 [[Immunoglobulin light chain|κ-chain]].<ref name=WHO-INN/><ref name=MerckIndex>Merck Index 14th Edition Monograph number 10585.</ref>

==Mechanism==
Nimotuzumab binds with optimal affinity and high specificity to the extracellular region of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). This results in a blockade of ligand binding and receptor activation.  Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key target in the development of cancer therapeutics. EGFR-targeting drugs have been shown to improve response when used with conventional treatments such as [[radiation therapy]] and [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=mAbs2009/>

==Development status==
It was developed at the [[Center of molecular immunology]] (CIM) in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].<ref>Mateo C, Moreno E, Amour K, Lombardero J, Harris W, Pérez R.

CIMYM BioSciences licensed European rights to nimotuzumab to [[Oncoscience AG]] in 2003, the South Korean rights to Kuhnil Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in 2005, and in 2006, licensed the Japanese rights to [[Daiichi Sankyo]] and rights to certain countries in Asia and Africa to Innogene Kalbiotech Pte Ltd.<ref name=YM2007report/>  Other licensees for nimotuzumab include Biocon BioPharmaceuticals Ltd.

In December 2012, CIMYM BioSciences dissolved and sold its assets related to nimotuzumab to InnoKeys PTE Ltd.<ref>YM Biosciences press release.

According to a 2009 review: "Nimotuzumab was approved for the following indications—For [[squamous cell carcinoma]] in head and neck (SCCHN) in India, Cuba, Argentina, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ukraine, Peru and Sri Lanka (expired now); for [[glioma]] (pediatric and adult) in Cuba, Argentina, Philippines and Ukraine; for [[nasopharyngeal cancer]] in China. It has been granted orphan drug status for glioma in USA and for glioma and [[pancreatic cancer]] in Europe."<ref name=mAbs2009/>

As of 2014 Nimotuzumab was in additional Phase I and II clinical trials.<ref>Vacchelli E et al.  Trial Watch: Tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy. Oncoimmunology. 2014 Jan 1;3(1):e27048. {{PMID|24605265}}</ref>

In April 2014, Daiichi Sankyo announced that it was halting a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study investigating nimotuzumab for first-line therapy in patients with unresectable and locally advanced [[squamous cell lung cancer]], due to safety issues in certain patients who received a combination of cisplatin, vinorelbine, radiotherapy, and nimotuzumab.<ref>Daiichi Sankyo press release.

== Safety ==

The toxicity and safety of nimotuzumab have been assessed in several pre-clinical and clinical studies wherein it was noticed that side effects usually caused by EGFR inhibitors, especially rashes and other skin toxicities,  were negligible.  Scientists have hypothesized that this is because nimotuzumab binds only to cells that express moderate to high EGFR levels.<ref name=mAbs2009/>

Nimotuzumab has been found to be very well tolerated in clinical trials. Common adverse reactions seen in patients treated with nimotuzumab include:<ref>[http://www.theracim.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4&Itemid=18 TheraCIM Official Site]</ref><ref>[http://www.biocon.com/docs/prescribing_information/oncology/biomab_pi.pdf BioMab Insert]</ref>
