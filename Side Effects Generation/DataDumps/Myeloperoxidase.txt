'''Myeloperoxidase''' ('''MPO''') is a [[peroxidase]] [[enzyme]] that in humans is encoded by the ''MPO'' [[gene]] on [[chromosome 17]].<ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: Myeloperoxidase | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene&cmd=retrieve&list_uids=4353 }}</ref> MPO is most abundantly expressed in [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s (a subtype of [[white blood cell]]s), and produces hypohalous acids to carry out their [[antimicrobial]] activity.<ref name="entrez"/><ref name="pmid15689384">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klebanoff SJ | title = Myeloperoxidase: friend and foe | journal = Journal of Leukocyte Biology | volume = 77 | issue = 5 | pages = 598–625 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15689384 | doi = 10.1189/jlb.1204697 }}</ref> It is a [[lysosome|lysosomal]] protein stored in [[azurophilic granules]] of the neutrophil and released into the [[extracellular space]] during degranulation.<ref name="pmid6192815">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kinkade JM, Pember SO, Barnes KC, Shapira R, Spitznagel JK, Martin LE | title = Differential distribution of distinct forms of myeloperoxidase in different azurophilic granule subpopulations from human neutrophils | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 296–303 | date = Jul 1983 | pmid = 6192815 | doi=10.1016/0006-291x(83)91627-3}}</ref> Neutrophil verdoperoxidase has a [[heme]] pigment, which causes its green color in secretions rich in [[neutrophils]], such as [[pus]] and some forms of [[mucus]].

== Structure ==

The 150-[[kiloDalton|kDa]] MPO protein is a cationic [[homodimer]] consisting of two 15-kDa light chains and two variable-weight glycosylated heavy chains bound to a prosthetic [[heme]] group.<ref name="ELISA">{{cite web|url=http://bioaimscientific.com/sites/default/files/manual/MouseMPOELISA.pdf|title=Mouse MPO EasyTestTM ELISA Kit}}</ref><ref name="pmid9553712">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathy-Hartert M, Bourgeois E, Grülke S, Deby-Dupont G, Caudron I, Deby C, Lamy M, Serteyn D | title = Purification of myeloperoxidase from equine polymorphonuclear leucocytes | journal = Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research = Revue Canadienne De Recherche Vétérinaire | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–32 | date = Apr 1998 | pmid = 9553712 | pmc = 1189459 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid21297906">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davies MJ | title = Myeloperoxidase-derived oxidation: mechanisms of biological damage and its prevention | journal = Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–19 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21297906 | doi = 10.3164/jcbn.11-006FR | pmc=3022070}}</ref> The light chains are [[glycosylate]]d and contain the modified iron [[protoporphyrin IX]] [[active site]]. Together, the light and heavy chains form two identical 73-kDa monomers connected by a [[cystine]] bridge at Cys153. The protein forms a deep crevice which holds the heme group at the bottom, as well as a [[hydrophobic]] pocket at the entrance to the distal heme cavity which carries out its catalytic activity.<ref name="pmid21297906"/>

Three [[isoform]]s have been identified, differing only in the size of the heavy chains.<ref name="ELISA"/>

MPO contains a [[calcium]] binding site with seven [[ligand]]s, forming a pentagonal pyramid conformation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} One of the ligands is the [[carbonyl]] group of Asp 96. Calcium-binding is important for structure of the active site because of Asp 96's close proximity to the catalytic His95 [[Substituent|side chain]].<ref name="pmid11237766">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shin K, Hayasawa H, Lönnerdal B | title = Mutations affecting the calcium-binding site of myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 281 | issue = 4 | pages = 1024–9 | date = Mar 2001 | pmid = 11237766 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.2001.4448 }}</ref>
 
== Function ==
MPO is a member of the XPO subfamily of peroxidases and produces [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl) from [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and [[chloride]] [[anion]] (Cl<sup>−</sup>) (or the equivalent from a non-chlorine halide) during the neutrophil's [[respiratory burst]]. It requires heme as a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]. Furthermore, it oxidizes [[tyrosine]] to tyrosyl radical using [[hydrogen peroxide]] as an [[oxidizing agent]].<ref name="ELISA"/><ref name="pmid8390491">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heinecke JW, Li W, Francis GA, Goldstein JA | title = Tyrosyl radical generated by myeloperoxidase catalyzes the oxidative cross-linking of proteins | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 91 | issue = 6 | pages = 2866–72 | date = Jun 1993 | pmid = 8390491 | pmc = 443356 | doi = 10.1172/JCI116531 }}</ref> [[Hypochlorous acid]] and tyrosyl radical are [[cytotoxic]], so they are used by the neutrophil to kill [[bacteria]] and other [[pathogen]]s.<ref name="pmid9787133">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hampton MB, Kettle AJ, Winterbourn CC | title = Inside the neutrophil phagosome: oxidants, myeloperoxidase, and bacterial killing | journal = Blood | volume = 92 | issue = 9 | pages = 3007–17 | date = Nov 1998 | pmid = 9787133 }}</ref> However, this hypochlorous acid may also cause [[oxidative damage]] in host tissue.

== Clinical significance ==

[[Myeloperoxidase deficiency]] is a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme, which predisposes to [[immune deficiency]].<ref name="pmid11111115">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kutter D, Devaquet P, Vanderstocken G, Paulus JM, Marchal V, Gothot A | title = Consequences of total and subtotal myeloperoxidase deficiency: risk or benefit ? | journal = Acta Haematologica | volume = 104 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–5 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11111115 | doi = 10.1159/000041062 }}</ref>

[[Antibody|Antibodies]] against MPO have been implicated in various types of [[vasculitis]], most prominently three clinically and pathologically recognized forms: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA); and [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (EGPA, formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome). Antibodies are also known as [[anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies]] (ANCAs), though ANCAs have also been detected in [[staining]] of the perinuclear region.<ref name="pmid25629443">{{cite journal | vauthors = Flint SM, McKinney EF, Smith KG | title = Emerging concepts in the pathogenesis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis | journal = Current Opinion in Rheumatology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–203 | date = Mar 2015 | pmid = 25629443 | doi = 10.1097/BOR.0000000000000145 }}</ref>

=== Medical uses ===

An initial 2003 study suggested that MPO could serve as a sensitive predictor for [[myocardial infarction]] in patients presenting with [[chest pain]].<ref name="pmid14573731">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brennan ML, Penn MS, Van Lente F, Nambi V, Shishehbor MH, Aviles RJ, Goormastic M, Pepoy ML, McErlean ES, Topol EJ, Nissen SE, Hazen SL | title = Prognostic value of myeloperoxidase in patients with chest pain | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 349 | issue = 17 | pages = 1595–604 | date = Oct 2003 | pmid = 14573731 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa035003 }}</ref> Since then, there have been over 100 published studies documenting the utility of MPO testing. The 2010 Heslop et al. study reported that measuring both MPO and CRP (C-reactive protein; a general and cardiac-related marker of inflammation) provided added benefit for risk prediction than just measuring CRP alone.<ref name="pmid20223364"/>

[[immunohistochemistry|Immunohistochemical]] staining for myeloperoxidase used to be administered in the diagnosis of [[acute myeloid leukemia]] to demonstrate that the leukemic cells were derived from the [[myeloid]] lineage.

=== Inhibitors of MPO ===

[[Azide]] has been used traditionally as an MPO inhibitor, but 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABH) is a more specific inhibitor of MPO.<ref name="pmid9020887">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kettle AJ, Gedye CA, Winterbourn CC | title = Mechanism of inactivation of myeloperoxidase by 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 321 | issue =  2| pages = 503–8 | date = Jan 1997 | pmid = 9020887 | pmc = 1218097 | doi =  10.1042/bj3210503| series = 321 }}</ref>
