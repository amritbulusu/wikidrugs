'''Resminostat''' ('''4SC-201''' or '''RAS2410''') is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of [[histone deacetylase]]s (HDACs), of which inhibitors are [[antineoplastic agent]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selleckchem.com/products/resminostat-ras2410.html####|title=Biological activity of resminostat in selleck chemicals research|publisher=selleck}}</ref>
<br />
In 2011, the German drug maker 4SC was granted [[orphan drug]] designation for resminostat by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]] for the treatment of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] (HCC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/4scs-anti-cancer-drug-resminostat-achieves-median-overall-survival-80-month|title=4SC's Anti-Cancer Drug Resminostat achieves Median Overall Survival of 8.0 Months in Second-Line Advanced Liver Cancer (HCC) Patients|date=September 2012}}</ref>

In 2016 the FDA granted [another?] [[Investigational New Drug|IND]] for clinical tests in combination with [[sorafenib]] for HCC.<ref name=IND-2016>[http://pipelinereview.com/index.php/2016022460511/Small-Molecules/4SC-AG-FDA-approves-IND-application-for-resminostat-in-liver-cancer.html 4SC AG: FDA approves IND application for resminostat in liver cancer. Feb 2016]</ref> 4SC say "In several phase I and phase II trials, resminostat has already demonstrated very good safety and tolerability, alongside promising indications of efficacy."<ref name=IND-2016/>

==Clinical trials==
It has undergone a phase I/II clinical trial for K-ras mutated advanced [[colorectal carcinoma]].<ref>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01277406 4SC-201 (Resminostat) in Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma (SHORE)]</ref>

It has undergone a phase II clinical trial for relapsed or refractory [[Hodgkin's Lymphoma]].<ref>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01037478 Resminostat (4SC-201) in Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma (SAPHIRE)]</ref>

== Mechanism ==
Resminostat restrains the [[phosphorylation]] of [[4E-BP1]] and [[P70S6 kinase|p70S6k]], indicating an disturbance with [[Akt/PKB signaling pathway|Akt signalling pathway]].The treatment of resminostat leads to a drop of Bim and [[Bcl-2-associated X protein|Bax]] protein level and [[Bcl-xL]] level.<ref>{{cite journal|title=First-in-human, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic phase I study of Resminostat, an oral histone deacetylase inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors.|doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0735 |vauthors=Brunetto AT, etal |volume=19|issue=19|pages=5494â€“504|date=1 Oct 2013}}</ref>

As with other [[HDAC inhibitor]]s such as [[pracinostat]], the inhibition of HDACs by resminostat results in an accumulation of highly acetylated [[histone]]s, followed by an abduction of [[chromatin remodeling]], inhibition of tumor suppressor [[gene transcription|genes transcription]] and [[cell division]], and finally tumor [[cell apoptosis]].
