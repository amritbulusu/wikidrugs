In 2017, the [[American College of Physicians]]'s guidelines were updated to recognize metformin as the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes. These guidelines supersede earlier reviews.  For example, a 2014 review found tentative evidence that people treated with sulfonylureas had a higher risk of severe low blood sugar events (RR 5.64), though their risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events was lower than the risk of those treated with metformin (RR 0.67).

=== Prediabetes ===
Metformin treatment of people at a [[prediabetes]] stage of risk for type 2 diabetes may decrease their chances of developing the disease, although intensive [[physical exercise]] and dieting work significantly better for this purpose. In a large U.S. study known as the Diabetes Prevention Program, participants were divided into groups and given either placebo, metformin, or lifestyle intervention and followed for an average of three years.

=== Gastrointestinal ===
In a clinical trial of 286 subjects, 53.2% of the 141 given immediate-release metformin (as opposed to placebo) reported diarrhea, versus 11.7% for placebo, and 25.5% reported nausea/vomiting, versus 8.3% for those on placebo.<ref name = DF&C>{{cite book |title=Drug Facts and Comparisons 2005 |date=October 2004  |publisher=Facts and Comparisons |location=St. Louis, Mo |isbn=1-57439-193-3 }}</ref>

Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased.

[[Phenformin]], another biguanide, was withdrawn from the market because of an increased risk of lactic acidosis (rate of 40-64 per 100,000 patient-years).<ref name=Stang /> However, metformin is safer than phenformin, and the risk of developing lactic acidosis is not increased except for known high-risk groups.<ref name="Salpeter" />

Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic [[gluconeogenesis]], a process that metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs.<ref name=Umesh>{{cite book |authors=Maharani U |editor=Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ |chapter=Chapter 27: Diabetes Mellitus & Hypoglycemia |title=CURRENT Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2010 |edition=49th |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2009 |pages=1092–93 |isbn=0-07-162444-9}}</ref> Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication.

Metformin has been suggested to increase production of lactate in the large intestine, which could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors.<ref name=Kirpichnikov /> However, the clinical significance of this is unknown, and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production.<ref name=Umesh /><ref name=Golan /><ref>{{cite book |authors=Davis SN |editor=Brunton L, Lazo J, Parker K |title=[[Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2 |pages= |chapter=Chapter 60: Insulin, Oral Hypoglycemic Agents, and the Pharmacology of the Endocrine Pancreas}}</ref>

Metformin has acid dissociation constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base than most other basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the [[Lipophilicity|lipid solubility]] of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As a result of its low lipid solubility it requires the [[Membrane transport protein|transporter]] [[SLC22A1]] in order for it to enter cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rosilio|first1=C|last2=Ben-Sahra|first2=I|last3=Bost|first3=F|last4=Peyron|first4=JF|title=Metformin: a metabolic disruptor and anti-diabetic drug to target human leukemia.|journal=Cancer Letters|date=1 May 2014|volume=346|issue=2|pages=188–96|doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2014.01.006|pmid=24462823}}</ref><ref name=Pry2015>{{cite journal|last1=Pryor|first1=R|last2=Cabreiro|first2=F|title=Repurposing metformin: an old drug with new tricks in its binding pockets.|journal=The Biochemical Journal|date=1 November 2015|volume=471|issue=3|pages=307–22|pmid=26475449|doi=10.1042/bj20150497|pmc=4613459}}</ref> The logP of metformin is less than that of [[phenformin]] (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in [[phenformin]].

Metformin became available in the [[British National Formulary]] in 1958. It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona.<!--Being a generic drug, it was at a commercial disadvantage; phenformin and buformin were marketed as being more potent and were supported by large pharmaceutical companies with a large sales force.

== Formulations ==
[[File:Metformin 500mg Tablets.jpg|thumb|right|Generic metformin 500-mg tablets, as sold in the United Kingdom]]
<!-- editors, please note that the trade names noted above redirect to this section i.e. Metformin#Formulations-->
The name "Metformin" is the [[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]] and [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] for the drug. It is sold under several [[trade name]]s, including Glucophage XR, Carbophage SR, Riomet, Fortamet, Glumetza, Obimet, Gluformin, Dianben, Diabex, Diaformin, Siofor, Metfogamma and Glifor.

Liquid metformin is sold under the name Riomet in India. Each 5&nbsp;ml of Riomet is equivalent to the 500-mg tablet form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rxwiki.com/Metformin|title=Metformin|date=9 July 2012|work=rxwiki|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915084453/http://www.rxwiki.com/metformin|archivedate=15 September 2013|df=}}</ref>

Metformin IR (immediate release) is available in 500, 850, and 1000-mg tablets.  All of these are available as generic drugs in the U.S.

Metformin SR (slow release) or XR (extended release) was introduced in 2004. It is available in 500, 750, and 1000-mg strengths, mainly to counteract common gastrointestinal side effects, as well as to increase compliance by reducing [[pill burden]]. No difference in effectiveness exists between the two preparations.

=== Combination with other drugs ===
When used for type 2 diabetes, metformin is often prescribed in combination with other drugs. Several are available as [[fixed-dose combination]]s, to reduce pill burden and simplify administration.<ref name=FDC>{{cite journal |author=Bailey CJ, Day C |title=Fixed-dose single tablet antidiabetic combinations |journal=Diabetes Obes Metab |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=527–33 |date=June 2009  |pmid=19175373 |doi=10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00993.x}}</ref>

==== DPP-4 inhibitors ====
[[Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor]]s inhibit [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]] and thus reduce [[glucagon]] and blood glucose levels.

DPP-4 inhibitors combined with metformin include a [[sitagliptin/metformin]] combination and a [[saxagliptin]] combination (Komboglyze), and with [[alogliptin]] as Kazano among others.

In Europe, Canada, and elsewhere metformin combined with [[linagliptin]] is marketed under the trade name Jentadueto.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002279/smops/Positive/human_smop_000377.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d127 Jentadueto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723162922/http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages%2Fmedicines%2Fhuman%2Fmedicines%2F002279%2Fsmops%2FPositive%2Fhuman_smop_000377.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d127 |date=2012-07-23 }} at the European Medicines Agency.

==== Sulfonylureas ====
[[Sulfonylurea]]s act by increasing insulin release from the [[beta cell]]s in the [[pancreas]]. Metformin is available combined with the sulfonylureas [[glipizide]] (Metaglip) and [[glibenclamide]] (US: glyburide) (Glucovance). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available (the latter is more popular).<ref name=Top200Generics>{{cite web |url= http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/imshealth/Global/Content/IMS%20Institute/Static%20File/IHII_UseOfMed_report.pdf |title= "The Use of Medicines in the United States: Review of 2010" |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110422165905/http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/imshealth/Global/Content/IMS%20Institute/Static%20File/IHII_UseOfMed_report.pdf |archivedate= 2011-04-22 |df=  }}&nbsp;{{small|(1.79&nbsp;MB)}}.
