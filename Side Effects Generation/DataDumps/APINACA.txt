'''AKB48''' ('''APINACA''', '''N-(1-adamantyl)-1-pentyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide''') is a drug that acts as a reasonably potent [[agonist]] for the [[cannabinoid receptor]]s,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Uchiyama | first1 = N. | last2 = Kawamura | first2 = M. | last3 = Kikura-Hanajiri | first3 = R. | last4 = Goda | first4 = Y. | title = URB-754: A new class of designer drug and 12 synthetic cannabinoids detected in illegal products | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2012.08.047 | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 227 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 21–32 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23063179| pmc = }}</ref> with a K<sub>i</sub> of 304.5nM and a EC<sub>50</sub> of 585nM at [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} It had never previously been reported in the scientific or patent literature, and was first identified by laboratories in Japan in March 2012 as an ingredient in [[synthetic cannabis]] smoking blends, along with a related compound [[APICA]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Uchiyama | first1 = N. | last2 = Kawamura | first2 = M. | last3 = Kikura-Hanajiri | first3 = R. | last4 = Goda | first4 = Y. | title = Identification of two new-type synthetic cannabinoids, N-(1-adamantyl)-1-pentyl-1H-indole-3-carboxamide (APICA) and N-(1-adamantyl)-1-pentyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (APINACA), and detection of five synthetic cannabinoids, AM-1220, AM-2233, AM-1241, CB-13 (CRA-13), and AM-1248, as designer drugs in illegal products | doi = 10.1007/s11419-012-0136-7 | journal = Forensic Toxicology | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 114 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Structurally it closely resembles cannabinoid compounds from patent [http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2003035005 WO 2003/035005] but with a simple pentyl chain on the indazole 1-position, and AKB48 falls within the claims of this patent despite not being disclosed as an example.

==Legality==

APINACA was made illegal in Japan in 2012,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://members.wto.org/crnattachments/2012/tbt/JPN/12_1575_00_e.pdf | format = PDF | title = Designation of "Shitei Yakubutsu" (designated substances) based on the provision of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (1960, Law No.145)}}</ref> and was banned as a [[temporary class drug]] in New Zealand from 13 July 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/1800482ea20e00f8cc257a32005ae9f8!OpenDocument| title =  Temporary Class Drug Notice | date = 5 July 2012 | work = Department of Internal Affairs | location = New Zealand}}</ref>

APINACA has been banned in Latvia since 14 November 2013.

The DEA announced its intent to schedule APINACA on 16 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dea.gov/divisions/hq/2013/hq051613.shtml | title=DEA Makes Three More “Fake Pot” Drugs Temporarily Illegal Today | publisher=Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) | accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref>

It is also banned in Germany as an [[Drugs controlled by the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz|Anlage II]] controlled drug.

APINACA is listed in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) and therefore illegal in Singapore as of May 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnb.gov.sg/Libraries/CNB_Newsroom_Files/CNB_NR_-_30_Apr_2015.sflb.ashx | title=CNB NEWS RELEASE | publisher=Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) | date=30 April 2015 | accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref>

As of October 2015 APINACA is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

APINACA is banned in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mzcr.cz/Admin/_upload/files/3/Nov%C3%A9%20PL.pdf | title=Látky, o které byl doplněn seznam č. 4 psychotropních látek (příloha č. 4 k nařízení  vlády č. 463/2013 Sb.) | publisher=Ministerstvo zdravotnictví | language=Czech}}</ref>

==Detection==
A forensic standard of APINACA is available, and the compound has been posted on the Forendex website of potential drugs of abuse.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://forendex.southernforensic.org/index.php/detail/index/1221 | title=APINACA | publisher=Southern Association of Forensic Scientists | accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref>
