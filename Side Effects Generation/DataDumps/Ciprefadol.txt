==Synthesis==
Fusion of an [[alicyclic]] ring onto the piperidine so as to form a [[perhydroisoquinoline]] is apparently consistent with
analgesic activity.
[[File:Ciprefadol synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Ciprefadol synthesis: D. M. Zimmerman and VI. S. Marshall, [[Eli Lilly]]; {{US patent|4029796}} (1977).]]
Synthesis of this agent, ciprefadol (12), starts with the [[Michael addition]] of the anion from cyclohexanone (1) onto [[acrylonitrile]]. [[Saponification]] of the nitrile (2) to the corresponding acid (3) followed by [[Curtius rearrangement]] leads to isocyanate (5). Acid
hydrolysis of the [[isocyanate]] leads directly to the [[indoline]] (6), no doubt by way of internal [[Schiff base]] formation from
the intermediate amine. [[Methylation]] by means of [[trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate]] affords [[ternary compound|ternary]] [[iminium salt]] 7. Treatment of that reactive carbonyl-like functionality with [[diazomethane]] gives the so-called [[azonia salt]] 8 (note the analogy to the hypothetical [[oxirane]] involved in ring expansion of ketones with [[diazomethane]]). Exposure of the [[aziridinium]] intermediate to base leads to ring opening and consequent formation of the [[octahydroisoquinoline]] (9). Reduction of the [[enamine]] (catalytic or borohydride) affords the [[perhydroisoquinoline]] 10. This compound is then subjected to one of the ''N''-demethylation sequences and the
resulting secondary amine alkylated with [[cyclopropylmethyl bromide]]; ''O''-Demethylation of the phenol ether completes the preparation of ciprefadol (12).
