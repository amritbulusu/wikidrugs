'''Colestolone''' ({{abbrlink|INN|International Nonproprietary Name}}, {{abbrlink|USAN|United States Adopted Name}}), also known as '''5α-cholest-8(14)-en-3β-ol-15-one''', is a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[sterol]] [[biosynthesis]] which is described as a [[hypocholesterolemic|hypocholesterolemic (lipid-lowering) agent]].<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Colestolone has been found to significantly reduce serum levels of [[cholesterol]] both in animals and in humans.<ref name="US5112815" /><ref name="pmid3346239" /><ref name="pmid6953447" /> It inhibits multiple relatively early-stage steps in cholesterol biosynthesis such as [[HMG-CoA reductase]]<ref name="DIANE">{{cite book|title=Pharmaceutical R&D costs, risks, and rewards.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh49Llr2x0AC&pg=PA25|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-2103-0|pages=25–}}</ref> and does not appear to affect any late-stage steps (after [[squalene]], specifically).<ref name="pmid6953447" /> Unlike late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors like [[triparanol]] and [[azacosterol]], no accumulation of sterols has been observed in animals treated with colestolone, suggesting that it does not share the [[toxicity]] of late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors.<ref name="pmid6953447" />

In addition to its potent inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, it is notable that colestolone also happens to serve as a [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]] of cholesterol, and is efficiently [[biotransformation|converted]] into it in rat [[liver]] [[homogenate]]s and upon [[oral administration]] to rats.<ref name="pmid6953447" />
