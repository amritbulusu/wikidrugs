'''Alipogene tiparvovec''' (marketed under the [[trade name]] '''Glybera''') is a [[gene therapy]] treatment, developed and marketed by uniQure N.V., that compensates for [[lipoprotein lipase deficiency]] (LPLD), a rare inherited disorder which can cause severe [[pancreatitis]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/21/health/european-agency-recommends-approval-of-a-gene-therapy.html European Agency Backs Approval of a Gene Therapy] July 20, 2012</ref> In July 2012, the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended it for approval, the first recommendation for a gene therapy treatment in either Europe or the United States.

==Mechanism==

The [[adeno-associated virus]] serotype 1 (AAV1) viral vector delivers an intact copy of the human [[lipoprotein lipase]] (LPL) gene to muscle cells. The LPL gene is not inserted into the cell's chromosomes but remains as free floating DNA in the nucleus.  The injection is followed by [[immunosuppressive therapy]] to prevent immune reactions to the virus.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33166/title/Gene-Therapy-Arrives-in-Europe/|title = Gene Therapy Arrives in Europe|date = November 6, 2012|accessdate = |website = TheScientist|publisher = }}</ref>

Data from the clinical trials indicates that fat concentrations in blood were reduced between 3 and 12 weeks after injection, in nearly all patients.  The advantages of AAV include apparent lack of pathogenicity, delivery to non-dividing cells, and much smaller risk of insertion<ref name="valdmanis2012">{{cite journal |vauthors =Valdmanis PN, Lisowski L, Kay MA |title=rAAV-mediated tumorigenesis: still unresolved after an AAV assault. |journal= Molecular Therapy |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=2014–17 |date=November 2012 |pmid=23131853 |doi=10.1038/mt.2012.220 |pmc=3498811}}</ref> compared to [[retrovirus]]es, which show random insertion with accompanying risk of [[cancer]].

==History==
LPLD is a rare condition (prevalence worldwide 1–2 per million) and as such its clinical testing has involved unusually small cohort sizes. The first main trial (CT-AMT-011-01) involved just 14 subjects<ref name="StroesNierman2008">{{cite journal|last1=Stroes|first1=E. S.|last2=Nierman|first2=M. C.|last3=Meulenberg|first3=J.

It was approved in Europe in 2012.<ref name=MIT-TR2016/> 

Alipogene tiparvovec was expected to cost around $1.6 million per treatment in 2012,<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Wall Street Journal | author=Jeanne Whalen  | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203707604578095091940871524 | date=November 2, 2012 | title=Gene-Therapy Approval Marks Major Milestone}}</ref>  revised to $1 million in 2015,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=TradeSecrets | author=Chris Morrison | date= March 3, 2015 | title=$1-million price tag set for Glybera gene therapy}}</ref> making it the most expensive medicine in the world at the time.<ref>[http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_204696.asp Gene therapy approved in Europe for first time]</ref>

In 2015 UniQure dropped its plan to approval in the US and exclusively licensed rights to sell the drug in Europe to [[Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A.]].<ref name=MIT-TR2016/>

As of 2016, only one person had been treated with the drug.<ref name=MIT-TR2016>{{cite news|last1=Regalado|first1=Antonio|title=The World’s Most Expensive Medicine Is a Bust|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601165/the-worlds-most-expensive-medicine-is-a-bust/amp/|work=MIT Technology Review|date=May 4, 2016|language=en}}</ref>

In April 2017, uniQure announced that it will not pursue the renewal of the marketing authorization in Europe when it was scheduled to expire the coming October, due to lack of demand.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sagonowsky|first1=Eric|title=With its launch fizzling out, UniQure gives up on $1M+ gene therapy Glybera|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/uniqure-gives-up-1m-gene-therapy-glybera|work=FiercePharma|date=April 20, 2017|language=en}}</ref>
