'''Tadalafil''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]])<ref name="INN">{{cite web|title=International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN). Recommended International Nonproprietary Names (Rec. INN): List 47|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/RL47.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=5 November 2016|page=106}}</ref> is a [[PDE5 inhibitor]]  marketed in pill form for treating [[erectile dysfunction]] (ED) under the name '''Cialis''' {{IPAc-en|s|i|ˈ|æ|l|ᵻ|s}} {{respell|see|AL|iss}}, and under the name '''Adcirca''' {{IPAc-en|æ|d|ˈ|s|ɜr|k|ə}} {{respell|ad|SUR|kə}} for the treatment of [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]]. In October 2011 the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Cialis for treating the signs and symptoms of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) as well as a combination of BPH and erectile dysfunction when the conditions coincide. It initially was developed by the [[biotechnology]] company [[ICOS]], and then again developed and marketed worldwide by Lilly ICOS, LLC, the joint venture of ICOS Corporation and [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. ''Cialis'' tablets, in 2.5&nbsp;mg, 5&nbsp;mg, 10&nbsp;mg, and 20&nbsp;mg doses, are yellow, film-coated, and almond-shaped. The approved dose for pulmonary arterial hypertension is 40&nbsp;mg (two 20&nbsp;mg tablets) once daily.

Tadalafil is also manufactured and sold under the name of '''Tadacip''' by the Indian pharmaceutical company [[Cipla]] in doses of 10&nbsp;mg and 20&nbsp;mg.

On November 21, 2003 the FDA approved tadalafil (as Cialis) for sale in the United States as the third ED prescription drug pill (after [[sildenafil]] (Viagra) and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra)). Like sildenafil and vardenafil, tadalafil is recommended as an 'as needed' medication. Cialis is also offered as a once-daily medication.

Tadalafil was approved in May 2009 in the United States for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.drugs.com/newdrugs/fda-approves-adcirca-tadalafil-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-1366.html| accessdate=2014-11-13 | publisher= Drugs.com | title = FDA approves tadalafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension}}</ref> and is under regulatory review in other regions for this condition. In late November 2008, Eli Lilly sold the exclusive rights to commercialize tadalafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension in the United States to [[United Therapeutics]] for an upfront payment of $150 million.

==Side effects==
Tadalafil has been used in approximately 15,000 men participating in clinical trials, and over eight million men worldwide (primarily in the post-approval/post-marketing setting). The most common [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] when using tadalafil are [[headache]], stomach discomfort or pain, indigestion, [[burping]], acid reflux, [[back pain]], [[Myalgia|muscle aches]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], and [[Nasal congestion|stuffy]] or [[Rhinorrhea|runny nose]]. These side effects reflect the ability of PDE5 inhibition to cause vasodilation (cause blood vessels to widen), and usually go away after a few hours. [[Back pain]] and muscle aches can occur 12 to 24 hours after taking the drug, and the symptom usually disappears after 48 hours.

In May 2005, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] found that tadalafil (along with other PDE5 inhibitors) was associated with vision impairment related to NAION ([[Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy|non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy]]) in certain patients taking these drugs in the post-marketing (outside of clinical trials) setting. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION unrelated to PDE5 use, including: low cup to disc ratio ("crowded disc"), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, [[hyperlipidemia]] and smoking. Given the small number of NAION events with PDE5 use (fewer than one in one million), the large number of users of PDE5 inhibitors (millions) and the fact that this event occurs in a similar population to those who do not take these medicines, the FDA concluded that they were not able to draw a cause and effect relationship, given these patients underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects. However, the label of all three PDE5 inhibitors was changed to alert clinicians to a possible association.

In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, requires a more prominent warning of the potential risk of [[Hearing impairment|sudden hearing loss]] as the result of postmarketing reports of deafness associated with use of PDE5 inhibitors.<ref name="FDA PDE5">{{cite web | url= http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm| title= FDA Announces Revisions to Labels for Cialis, Levitra and Viagra| author= | date= 2007-10-18| publisher= [[Food and Drug Administration]]| accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref>

==Drug interactions==
Since PDE5 inhibitors such as tadalafil may cause transiently low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]), [[alkyl nitrites]] ([[poppers]]) should not be taken for at least 48 hours after taking the last dose of tadalafil. Using poppers (such as the sex drug [[amyl nitrite]]) within this timeframe may increase the risk of life-threatening hypotension.

Since people who have taken tadalafil within the past 48 hours cannot take organic nitrates to relieve angina (such as [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|glyceryl trinitrate]] spray), these patients should seek immediate medical attention if they experience [[Angina pectoris|anginal]] chest pain.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic3/cialis_wcp.htm | title = Cialis: Warnings, Precautions, Pregnancy, Nursing, Abuse | publisher = RxList | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-04-06}}</ref>  In the event of a medical emergency, [[paramedic]]s and medical personnel should be notified of any recent doses of tadalafil.

Tadalafil is metabolized predominantly by the [[Liver|hepatic]] [[CYP3A4]] enzyme system. The presence of other drugs which induce this system can shorten tadalafil half-life and reduce serum levels, and hence efficacy, of the drug.

==Pharmacodynamics==

Although [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), [[vardenafil]] (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis) all work by inhibiting PDE5, tadalafil's pharmacologic distinction is its longer half-life (17.5 hours)<ref>{{cite book|title= Medicinal Chemistry| page=635| author= Sriram D | publisher= Pearson Education India, 2010}}</ref> — compared to sildenafil and vardenafil (both 4–5 hours)<ref>{{cite web| publisher= Medscape| title=Tadalafil (Cialis) and Vardenafil (Levitra) Recently Approved Drugs for Erectile Dysfunction| author= Kaye K. Gaines|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/471785}}</ref> — resulting in longer duration of action, and so partly responsible for "The Weekend Pill" nickname. Furthermore, the longer half-life is the basis for current investigation of tadalafil's daily therapeutic use in relieving pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sildenafil is approved in several world regions as a thrice-daily therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and the smooth muscle of the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (more commonly known as cyclic GMP or cGMP) in smooth muscle cells. cGMP relaxes smooth muscle and increases blood flow to the corpus cavernosum.

The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Tadalafil (and sildenafil and vardenafil) inhibits PDE5. However, because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local penile release of nitric oxide, tadalafil's inhibition of PDE5 will have no effect without direct sexual stimulation of the penis. The recommended tadalafil starting dose for most men is 10&nbsp;mg, taken as needed before sexual activity (but not more than once daily). The dose may be increased to 20&nbsp;mg or decreased to 5&nbsp;mg, per its efficacy and the man's personal tolerance of the drug. In June 2007, the European Commission approved low-dose (2.5&nbsp;mg and 5&nbsp;mg) Cialis to be used as single-daily ED therapy.

Although available since 2003 in 5, 10, 20&nbsp;mg dosage, in late 2008/early 2009, the U.S. FDA approved the commercial sale of Cialis in 2.5&nbsp;mg dosage as a once-a-day treatment for ED. The 2.5&nbsp;mg dose avoids earlier dispensing restrictions on higher dosages. The price of the 5&nbsp;mg and 2.5&nbsp;mg are often similar, so some people score and split the pill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/money-saving-guides/english/PillSplitting-FINAL.pdf|title=Pill Splitting|last=|first=|date=2010-01-25|website=|publisher=Consumer Reports Health|type=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

Moreover, tadalafil (Adcirca) 40&nbsp;mg was approved in 2009 in the United States and Europe (and 2010 in Canada and Japan) as a once-daily therapy to improve exercise ability in patients with [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]]. In patients with [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], the pulmonary vascular lumen is decreased as a result of vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling, resulting in increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Tadalafil is believed to increase pulmonary artery vasodilation, and inhibit vascular remodeling, thus lowering pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Right heart failure is the principal consequence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

On October 6, 2011, the U.S. FDA approved tadalafil to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is a condition in males in which the prostate gland becomes enlarged, obstructing the free flow of urine. Symptoms may include sudden urges to urinate (urgency), difficulty in starting urination (hesitancy), a weak urine stream, and more frequent urination — especially at night. The FDA has also approved tadalafil for treatment of both BPH and erectile dysfunction (ED) where the two conditions co-exist.

===Selectivity compared with other PDE5 inhibitors===
Tadalafil, sildenafil, and vardenafil all act by inhibiting the PDE5 enzyme. These drugs also inhibit other PDE enzymes. Sildenafil and vardenafil inhibit PDE6, an enzyme found in the eye, more than tadalafil.<ref name="selectivity">{{cite journal |last=Bischoff |first=E |date=June 2004 |title=Potency, selectivity, and consequences of nonselectivity of PDE inhibition |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=16 |pages=S11–4 |pmid=15224129 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901208 |url=http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v16/n1s/full/3901208a.html |accessdate=January 19, 2009}}</ref> Some sildenafil users see a bluish tinge and have a heightened sensitivity to light because of PDE6 inhibition.<ref name="ervin"/> Sildenafil and vardenafil also inhibit [[PDE1]] more than tadalafil.<ref name="selectivity" /> PDE1 is found in the brain, heart, and [[vascular smooth muscle]].<ref name="selectivity" /> It is thought that the inhibition of PDE1 by sildenafil and vardenafil leads to [[vasodilation]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], and [[tachycardia]].<ref name="selectivity" /> Tadalafil inhibits PDE11 more than sildenafil or vardenafil.<ref name="selectivity" /> PDE11 is expressed in [[skeletal muscle]], the [[prostate]], the [[liver]], the [[kidney]], the [[pituitary gland]], and the [[testes]].<ref name="selectivity" /> The effects on the body of inhibiting PDE11 are not known.<ref name="selectivity" />

==Chemistry==
Tadalafil is an [[Annulation|annulated]] [[2,5-Diketopiperazine|2,5-diketopiperazine]].<ref>{{Cite journal | title = 2,5-Diketopiperazines: Synthesis, Reactions, Medicinal Chemistry, and Bioactive Natural Products | author = Borthwick AD | journal = Chemical Reviews | year = May 2012 | volume = 112 | issue = 7 | pages = 3641–3716 | doi = 10.1021/cr200398y | pmid = 22575049}}</ref> It is also a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[[β-carboline]].

Tadalafil can be synthesized starting from (D)-[[tryptophan]] methyl ester and [[piperonal]] via a [[Pictet–Spengler reaction]]. This is followed by condensations with [[chloroacetyl chloride]] and [[methylamine]] to complete the diketopiperazine ring:<ref>{{Cite journal | title = An overview of the key routes to the best selling 5-membered ring heterocyclic pharmaceuticals | author = Baumann M | journal = Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry | year = May 2011 | volume = 7 | pages = 442–495 | doi = 10.3762/BJOC.7.57 | pmid =  21647262}}</ref>

==History==
The FDA's approval of Viagra ([[sildenafil]]) on March 27, 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fda-approves-viagra| title=FDA approves Viagra| publisher=History.com| accessdate=2014-11-12}}</ref> was a ground-breaking commercial event for the treatment of ED, with sales exceeding [[USD|US$]]1 billion. Subsequently, the FDA approved Levitra ([[vardenafil]]) on August 19, 2003,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-levitra.html | title = Generic Levitra Availability | publisher = Drugs.com | accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref> and Cialis (tadalafil) on November 21, 2003.

Cialis was discovered by Glaxo Wellcome (now [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) under a partnership between Glaxo and ICOS to develop new drugs that began in August&nbsp;1991.<ref name="tadalafil">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 9, 2003|title=The discovery of tadalafil: a novel and highly selective PDE5 inhibitor. 1: 5,6,11,11a-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[1',5':1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-1,3(2H)-dione analogues|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jm0300577|journal=[[Journal of Medicinal Chemistry]]|volume=46|issue=21|pages=4525–32|doi=10.1021/jm030056e|pmid=14521414|via=|vauthors=Daugan A, Grondin P, Ruault C, Le Monnier de Gouville AC, Coste H, Kirilovsky J, Hyafil F, Labaudinière R}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Rhonda |last=Richards |title=ICOS At A Crest On Roller Coaster |work=[[USA Today]] |page=3B |date=September 17, 1991}}</ref> In 1993, the [[Bothell, Washington]] biotechnology company ICOS Corporation began studying compound IC351, a [[cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5|phosphodiesterase type 5]] (PDE5) [[enzyme inhibitor]]. In 1994, Pfizer scientists discovered that sildenafil, which also inhibits the PDE5 enzyme, caused penile erection in men participating in a clinical study of a heart medicine. Although ICOS scientists were not testing compound IC351 for treating ED, they recognized its potential usefulness for treating that disorder. Soon, in 1994, ICOS received a patent for compound IC351 (structurally unlike sildenafil and vardenafil), and Phase 1 clinical trials began in 1995. In 1997, the Phase 2 clinical studies were initiated for men experiencing ED, then progressed to the Phase 3 trials that supported the drug's FDA approval. Although Glaxo had an agreement with ICOS to share profits 50/50 for drugs resulting from the partnership, Glaxo let the agreement lapse in 1996 as the drugs developed were not in the company's core markets.<ref name="ervin">{{cite news |first=Keith |last=Ervin |title=Deep Pockets + Intense Research + Total Control = The Formula -- Bothell Biotech Icos Keeps The Pipeline Full Of Promise |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |page=F1 |date=June 21, 1998 |accessdate=January 10, 2009 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980621&slug=2757327}}</ref>

In 1998, ICOS Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company formed the Lilly ICOS, LLC, joint venture company to further develop and commercialize tadalafil as a treatment for ED. Two years later, Lilly ICOS, LLC, filed a new drug application with the FDA for compound IC351 (under the tadalafil generic name, and the Cialis brand name). In May 2002, Lilly ICOS reported to the [[American Urological Association]] that clinical trial testing demonstrated that tadalafil was effective for up to 36 hours, and one year later, the FDA approved tadalafil. One advantage{{dubious|date=November 2016}} Cialis has over Viagra and Levitra is its 17.5-hour [[half-life]] (thus Cialis is advertised to work for up to 36 hours,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.healthexpress.co.uk/cialis.html | title = Cialis | publisher = HealthExpress | accessdate = January 6, 2015}}</ref> after which time there remains approximately 25% of the absorbed dose in the body) when compared to the four-hour half–life of sildenafil (Viagra).

In 2007, Eli Lilly and Company bought the ICOS Corporation for $2.3 billion. As a result, Eli Lilly owned Cialis and then closed the ICOS operations, ending the joint venture and firing most of ICOS's approximately 500 employees, except for 127 employees of the ICOS biologics facility, which subsequently was bought by CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC).

Persons surnamed "Cialis" objected to Eli Lilly and Company's so naming the drug, but the company has maintained that the drug's trade name is unrelated to the surname.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/sex/story/0,12550,887478,00.html | title = Drugs giant says its new pill will pack more punch than rival Viagra | last = Revill | first = Jo | date = February 2, 2003 | accessdate = 2007-04-06 | work = [[The Observer]]}}</ref>

On October 6, 2011, the U.S. FDA approved tadalafil<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm274642.htm|title=FDA approves Cialis to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia|last=|first=|date=2011-10-06|website=|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20170118091151/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm274642.htm|archive-date=2017-01-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}</ref> to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

===Marketing===
[[Image:Tadalafil 20mg.jpg|thumb|100px|20 mg Cialis tablet]]

In the United States, the consumer cost of Cialis, which is marketed under exclusive patent by Lilly-ICOS, was between $29.84 and $45.83 per 10&nbsp;mg pill in 2015.
