'''Brivanib alaninate''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]/USAN) also known as BMS-582664 is an investigational, anti-tumorigenic drug for oral administration. The drug is being developed by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] for the treatment of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] or HCC (also called ''malignant hepatoma''), the most common type of [[liver cancer]]. 

Brivanib alaninate is a multitargeted [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]] (as is sorafenib).

Brivanib alaninate also inhibits VEGFR and [[fibroblast growth factor]] receptors (FGFR), which is known to play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of HCC. To date, brivanib alaninate has been investigated in 29 studies, including more than 4,000 patients around the world.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Hepatocellular carcinoma (summary)==
Hepatocellular carcinoma <ref>National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=46363 Dictionary of Cancer Terms]</ref> is a primary cancer of the liver and is more common in men than in women. The disease occurs mostly in people who have scarring of the liver ([[cirrhosis]]) or after infection with [[hepatitis B]] or [[hepatitis C]]. Symptoms include pain and swelling in the abdomen, weight loss, weakness, loss of appetite and nausea. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a severe and life-threatening disease that is associated with poor overall survival.<ref>National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/adult-primary-liver/HealthProfessional Adult Primary Liver Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)]</ref>
While the choice of treatment depends mainly on how advanced the disease is, the only proven therapies to cure the cancer is surgery to remove the tumor and liver transplantation, but these therapies can only be carried out in very few patients. Other treatments include [[chemotherapy]] and [[immunotherapy]]. [[Radiofrequency ablation]] and ethanol injection are also used to remove small tumors.<ref>National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/adult-primary-liver/HealthProfessional/page4 Adult Primary Liver Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)/Treatment Option Overview]</ref>

As a result of poor liver function, [[metastases]], or both, only 10% to 20% of patients undergo surgery. In patients having surgery, the 5-year survival rate is only 25% to 50%. Several [[chemotherapeutic agents]] have been evaluated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. [[Doxorubicin]] (trade name [[Adriamycin]]; also known as [[hydroxydaunorubicin]]), the most widely used agent in HCC, has shown a 4% to 10.5% response rate in patients with HCC. Studies have shown that the overall response (OR) rate, but not [[overall survival]] (OS), doubles when doxorubicin was given in combination with [[cisplatin]], [[IFN]], and [[5-fluorouracil]].  The multitargeted [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]] [[sorafenib]] (trade name [[Nexavar]]), which inhibits [[vascular endothelial growth factor receptor]] (VEGFR), [[platelet-derived growth factor receptor]], raf, [[c-kit]], and flt-3, has been shown to inhibit HCC-induced proliferation and [[angiogenesis]]. Sorafenib has also been shown to provide a significant improvement in OS in patients with HCC.  Based on these results, researchers concluded that this class of agents may be effective in the treatment of HCC.

BMS-540215 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of human [[VEGFR-2]], with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 25 nmol/L and K<sub>i</sub> of 26 nmol/L. In addition, it inhibits [[VEGFR-1]] (IC<sub>50</sub> = 380 nmol/L) and [[VEGFR-3]] (IC<sub>50</sub> = 10 nmol/L). BMS-540215 also showed good selectivity for FGFR-1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 148 nmol/L), FGFR-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 125 nmol/L), and FGFR-3 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 68 nmol/L). Furthermore, BMS-540215 has been shown to selectively inhibit the proliferation of [[endothelial cells]] stimulated by [[VEGF]] and FGF ''in vitro'' with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 40 and 276 nmol/L, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4555 |title=Discovery and Validation of Biomarkers that Respond to Treatment with Brivanib Alaninate, a Small-Molecule VEGFR-2/FGFR-1 Antagonist |year=2007 |last1=Ayers |first1=M. |last2=Fargnoli |first2=J. |last3=Lewin |first3=A. |last4=Wu |first4=Q. |last5=Platero |first5=J.

== Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles  ==
BMS-582664 was originally prepared in an effort to improve the [[aqueous]] [[solubility]] and oral [[bioavailability]] of the ''parent compound'' BMS-540215. Both BMS-540215 and its orally active ester prodrug BMS-582664 (brivanib alaninate), demonstrate [[broad-spectrum]] ''[[in vivo]]'' antitumor activity over multiple dose levels as well as being effective at inducing stasis in large tumors. Brivanib alaninate can also be safely dosed in combination with other targeted and [[cytotoxic drugs]] including [[paclitaxel]] resulting in enhanced antitumor activity as observed by a long period of tumor growth inhibition. Overall survival was significantly extended by brivanib versus sorafenib, both first- line and when second.

===Mechanisms of action ===
The exact mechanisms by which brivanib treatment induces growth inhibition are not well understood. Ongoing research has shown that brivanib affects the host endothelium based on both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' effects). Brivanib may prevent the tumor mass from expanding by cutting off the supply of nutrients and growth factors to the tumor cells.

A recent study showed that brivanib effectively inhibits tumor growth and that brivanib-induced [[growth inhibition]] is associated with inactivation of VEGFR-2, increased apoptosis, a reduction in microvessel density, inhibition of cell proliferation, and [[down-regulation]] of cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D1, Cdk-2, Cdk-4, cyclin B1, and phospho-c-Myc.<ref name=Huynh/> Based on this study, researchers have concluded that cell cycle arrest due to a reduction in positive cell cycle regulators may be responsible for the observed growth inhibition. The same study showed that treatment with brivanib also led to a decrease in the number of proliferating cells compared with control.

===Dosing===
Doses required for achieving complete tumor stasis do not produce overt [[toxicity]] as defined by weight loss, mortality or unkempt appearance and behavior. The [[prodrug]] brivanib alaninate, which is completely [[hydrolyzed]] to BMS-540215 ''in vivo'', has [[pharmacokinetic]] properties suitable for once a day or twice daily oral dosing.
Completed and ongoing clinical trials show that brivanib alaninate appears to be tolerable and may exhibits favorable [[pharmacokinetic]] and [[pharmacodynamic]] profiles with evidence of target inhibition in surrogate tissues. Clinical and pharmacodynamic data support an oral once daily administration at 800&nbsp;mg. The [[investigational drug]] shows promising activity as single agent in HCC. Brivanib also shows promising activity in combination with [[cetuximab]] in [[colorectal cancer]].<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00640471|Cetuximab With or Without Brivanib in Treating Patients With K-Ras Wild Type Tumours and Metastatic Colorectal Cancer}}</ref> Further evaluations are currently ongoing.

===Safety profile===
Ongoing clinical trials have shown brivanib to have a manageable safety profile.  The trial drug is one of the first agents to demonstrate promising antitumor activity in advanced HCC patients treated with prior sorafenib.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2847 |title=Brivanib, a Dual FGF/VEGF Inhibitor, is Active Both First and Second Line against Mouse Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Developing Adaptive/Evasive Resistance to VEGF Inhibition |year=2011 |last1=Allen |first1=E. |last2=Walters |first2=I.

===Adverse reactions===
In clinical trials, brivanib was generally well tolerated.  The most common adverse events included fatigue, hypertension, and diarrhea.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1991 |pmid=22238246 |title=Phase II, Open-label Study of Brivanib as Second-line Therapy in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma |year=2012 |last1=Finn |first1=R.

==Ongoing clinical development program==
To further investigate the benefits of brivanib in patients with advanced HCC, a broad-spectrum, global, phase III clinical development plan called the ''Brivanib studies in HCC patients at RISK'' (''BRISK''), has been initiated.{{cn|date=July 2016}} ~<ref>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00858871 First Line Hepato Cellular Carcinoma (HCC) (BRISK FL)]</ref><ref>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00825955 Comparison of Brivanib and Best Supportive Care to Placebo for Treatment of Liver Cancer for Those Subjects Who Have Failed Sorafenib Treatment (BRISK PS)]</ref> 

Clinical benefits seen with brivanib in the first-line setting, and following the failure of sorafenib therapy, highlight the potential to improve the clinical course of patients with advanced HCC.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== Regulatory status ==
On 27 October 2011, [[orphan designation]] (EU/3/11/918) was granted by the [[European Commission]] to Bristol-Myers Squibb for brivanib alaninate for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Orphan_designation/2011/11/WC500117965.pdf orphan designation]{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> At the time of the orphan designation, several medicines were authorized in the EU for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

=== Submission and application===

At the time of submission of the application for orphan designation, clinical trials with brivanib alaninate in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were ongoing.  As part of the submission process, Bristol-Myers Squibb has provided sufficient information to show that brivanib alaninate might be of significant benefit for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma because it could provide an alternative for patients who cannot take or for whom existing treatments do not work. Early studies show that it might improve the treatment of patients with this condition, particularly if used when existing treatment had failed. However, this assumption needs to be confirmed at the time of EU marketing authorization, in order to maintain the orphan status.
