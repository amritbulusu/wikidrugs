'''Sumatriptan''' is a medication used for the treatment of [[migraine]] and [[Cluster headache|cluster]] headaches.<ref name=Der2014/>

It is a synthetic drug belonging to the [[triptan]] class. Structurally, it is an analog of the naturally occurring neuro-active [[alkaloids]] [[dimethyltryptamine]] ([[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]), [[bufotenine]], and [[5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine]], with an N-methyl sulfonamidomethyl- group at position C-5 on the [[indole]] ring.<ref>The presence of the [[Sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]] group in the molecule does not make sumatriptan a "sulfa drug".</ref>

Sumatriptan is produced and marketed by various drug manufacturers with many different trade names such as '''Imitrex''', '''Imigran''', '''Sumatran''', '''Sumatriptanum''', and '''Sumax''', also as [[Treximet]] as a combination product with [[naproxen]].

==Medical uses==
Sumatriptan is effective for ending or relieving the intensity of [[migraine]] and [[Cluster headache|cluster]] headaches.<ref name=Der2014/> It is most effective taken early after the start of the pain.<ref name=Der2014>{{cite journal|last1=Derry|first1=CJ|last2=Derry|first2=S|last3=Moore|first3=RA|title=Sumatriptan (all routes of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults - overview of Cochrane reviews.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=28 May 2014|volume=5|pages=CD009108|pmid=24865446|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009108.pub2}}</ref> Injected sumatriptan is more effective than other formulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/429671_4|title=Sumatriptan: Pharmacological Basis and Clinical Results|last=Dahlöf|first=Carl G. H.|date=|website=Medscape|publisher=|access-date=16 July 2016}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Large doses of sumatriptan can cause [[sulfhemoglobinemia]], a rare condition in which the blood changes from red to greenish-black, due to the integration of [[sulfur]] into the [[hemoglobin]] molecule.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6733203.stm|title=Patient bleeds dark green blood|date=8 June 2007|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> If sumatriptan is discontinued, the condition reverses within a few weeks.

Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan injection or tablets. Events reported have included [[coronary artery vasospasm]], transient myocardial ischemia, [[myocardial infarction]], [[ventricular tachycardia]], and ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kelly KM |date=June 1995 |title=Cardiac arrest following use of sumatriptan. |journal=MEDLINE |pmid=7783891 |volume=45 |pages=1211–3 |doi=10.1212/wnl.45.6.1211}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Malaise/fatigue occurred in less than 1% of the placebo group and 2–3% of the sumatriptan groups. Sleep disturbance occurred in less than 1% in the placebo group to 2% in the sumatriptan group.

==Mechanism of action==
Sumatriptan is structurally similar to [[serotonin]] (5-HT), and is a [[5-HT receptor]] (types [[5-HT1D|5-HT<sub>1D</sub>]] and [[5-HT1B|5-HT<sub>1B</sub>]]<ref>

</ref>) [[agonist]].  Sumatriptan's primary therapeutic effect, however, is in its inhibition of the release of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), likely through its 5-HT<sub>1D/</sub><sub>1B</sub> receptor-agonist action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Juhasz|first=G|last2=Zsombok|first2=T|last3=Jakab|first3=B|last4=Nemeth|first4=J|last5=Szolcsanyi|first5=J|last6=Bagdy|first6=G|date=2016-06-26|title=Sumatriptan Causes Parallel Decrease in Plasma Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) Concentration and Migraine Headache During Nitroglycerin Induced Migraine Attack|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2982.2005.00836.x|journal=Cephalalgia|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–183|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2005.00836.x}}</ref> This is substantiated by the efficacy of newly developed CGRP antagonists and antibodies in the preventative treatment of migraine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tso|first=Amy R.|last2=Goadsby|first2=Peter J.|date=2017-08-01|title=Anti-CGRP Monoclonal Antibodies: the Next Era of Migraine Prevention?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11940-017-0463-4|journal=Current Treatment Options in Neurology|language=en|volume=19|issue=8|pages=27|doi=10.1007/s11940-017-0463-4|issn=1092-8480}}</ref>  However, how agonism of the 5-HT<sub>1D/</sub><sub>1B</sub> receptors inhibits CGRP release is not fully understood. CGRP is believed to cause sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons, contributing to the pain experienced in migraine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Giniatullin|first=Rashid|last2=Nistri|first2=Andrea|last3=Fabbretti|first3=Elsa|date=2008-02-01|title=Molecular Mechanisms of Sensitization of Pain-transducing P2X3 Receptors by the Migraine Mediators CGRP and NGF|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-008-8020-5|journal=Molecular Neurobiology|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=83|doi=10.1007/s12035-008-8020-5|issn=0893-7648}}</ref> 

Sumatriptan is also shown to decrease the activity of the [[trigeminal nerve]], which presumably accounts for sumatriptan's efficacy in treating cluster headaches. The injectable form of the drug has been shown to abort a cluster headache within 30 minutes in 77% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 1991 | title = Treatment of acute cluster headache with sumatriptan. The Sumatriptan Cluster Headache Study Group | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 325 | issue = | pages = 322–6 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199108013250505 }}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Sumatriptan is administered in several forms: tablets, [[subcutaneous injection]], and nasal spray. Oral administration (as a [[succinate]]) suffers from poor [[bioavailability]], partly due to [[presystemic metabolism]]—some of it gets broken down in the stomach and bloodstream before it reaches the target arteries. A new rapid-release tablet formulation has the same bioavailability, but the maximum concentration is achieved on average 10–15 minutes earlier. When injected, sumatriptan is faster-acting (usually within 10 minutes), but the effect lasts for a shorter time. Sumatriptan is metabolised primarily by [[Monoamine oxidase|monoamine oxidase A]] into an [[indole acetic acid]] analogue, part of which is further conjugated with [[glucuronic acid]]. These metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile.  Only about 3% of the active drug may be recovered unchanged.

There is no simple, direct relationship between sumatriptan concentration (pharmacokinetics) per se in the blood and its anti-migraine effect (pharmacodynamics).  This paradox has, to some extent, been resolved by comparing the rates of absorption of the various sumatriptan formulations, rather than the absolute amounts of drug that they deliver.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Approval==
Sumatriptan was the first clinically available [[triptan]] (in 1991). In the United States, it is available only by medical prescription (and is frequently limited, without prior authorization, to a quantity of nine in a 30-day period). This requirement for a medical prescription also exists in Australia.<ref>{{cite web| title = Poisons Standard June 2017 | url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L00605/Html/Text#_Toc471222305 | accessdate = 22 July 2017 | date = 18 May 2017 }}</ref> However, it can be bought over the counter in the UK<ref>{{cite web |title=Press release: First Over The Counter (OTC) migraine pill made available |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON2023768 |publisher=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency |accessdate=January 28, 2015 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141205150130/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON2023768 |archivedate=2014-12-05}}</ref> and Sweden.<ref>{{cite web |author1=European Medicines Agency |authorlink1=European Medicines Agency |title=Assessment Report: Sumatriptan Galpharm 50 mg Tablets |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/human/002140/WC500122862.pdf |publisher=European Medicines Agency |accessdate=January 28, 2015 |page=20 |date=November 23, 2011}}</ref> Several dosage forms for sumatriptan have been approved, including [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], solution for [[Injection (medicine)|injection]], and nasal [[inhaler]]s.
