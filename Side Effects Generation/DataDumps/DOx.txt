'''DOx''' is a [[chemical class]] of [[substituent|substituted]] [[amphetamine]] derivatives featuring [[methoxy]] [[functional group|groups]] at the 2- and 5- positions of the [[phenyl]] [[simple aromatic ring|ring]], and a [[substituent]] such as [[alkyl]] or [[halogen]] at the 4- position of the phenyl ring. The compounds of this class are [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] and [[half-life|long-lasting]] [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[drug]]s, and act as highly [[functional selectivity|selective]] [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[partial agonist]]s.
