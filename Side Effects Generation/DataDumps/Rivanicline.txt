'''Rivanicline''' ('''TC-2403''', '''RJR-2403''', '''(E)-metanicotine''') is a drug which acts as a [[partial agonist]] at neural [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s. It is subtype-selective, binding primarily to the [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|α4β2]] [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor#Subunits|subtype]]. It has [[nootropic]] effects and was originally developed as a potential treatment for [[Alzheimer's disease]],<ref>Jang J, Sin KS, Park H. Synthesis of (+/-)-methyl-(1-aryl-4-pyridin-3-yl-but-3-enyl)-amines. ''Archives of Pharmacal Research''. 2001 Dec;24(6):503-7. {{PMID|11794523}}</ref><ref>Sapronov NS, Fedotova YO, Kuznetsova NN.

''Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine''. 2006 Dec;142(6):700-2. {{PMID|17603674}}</ref> but a second action that was subsequently found was that it inhibits the production of [[Interleukin-8]] and thus produces an [[antiinflammatory]] effect, and so it has also been developed as a potential treatment for [[ulcerative colitis]].<ref>Spoettl T, Paetzel C, Herfarth H, Bencherif M, Schoelmerich J, Greinwald R, Gatto GJ, Rogler G. (E)-metanicotine hemigalactarate (TC-2403-12) inhibits IL-8 production in cells of the inflamed mucosa. ''International Journal of Colorectal Disease''. 2007 Mar;22(3):303-12. {{PMID|16715250}}</ref> Rivanicline also has [[stimulant]] and [[analgesic]] actions which are thought to be mediated through stimulation of [[noradrenaline]] release,<ref>Li X, Eisenach JC. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor regulation of spinal norepinephrine release. ''Anesthesiology''. 2002 Jun;96(6):1450-6. {{PMID|12170059}}</ref> and so it could  also have other applications.
