'''Mepacrine''' ([[international nonproprietary name|INN]]), also called '''quinacrine''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) or by the trade name '''Atabrine''', is a [[medication|drug]] with several [[Medicine|medical]] applications. It is related to [[chloroquine]] and [[mefloquine]].

==Medical uses==
[[File:Atabrine advertisement in Guinea during WW2.jpg|thumb|left|''These men didn't take their Atabrine'' (as [[Antimalarial medication|anti-malaria drug]]); this sign was posted at the 363rd Station Hospital on Papua, New Guinea during World War II]]
The main uses of mepacrine are as an [[antiprotozoal]], [[antirheumatic]] and an intrapleural [[sclerosing]] agent.<ref name=drugsdotcom>[http://www.drugs.com/mmx/quinacrine-hydrochloride.html Drugs.com: Quinacrine.] Retrieved on August 24, 2009.</ref>

Antiprotozoal use include targeting [[giardiasis]], where mepacrine is indicated as a primary agent for patients with [[metronidazole]]-resistant giardiasis and patients who should not receive or can not tolerate metronidazole. Giardiasis that is very resistant may even require a combination of mepacrine and metronidazole.<ref name=drugsdotcom/>

Mepacrine is also used off-label for the treatment of [[systemic lupus erythematosus]],<ref name="pmid16623930">{{cite journal |vauthors=Toubi E, Kessel A, Rosner I, Rozenbaum M, Paran D, Shoenfeld Y |title=The reduction of serum B-lymphocyte activating factor levels following quinacrine add-on therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=Scand. J. Immunol. |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=299–303 |year=2006 |pmid=16623930 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3083.2006.01737.x}}</ref>  indicated in the treatment of discoid and subcutaneous lupus erythematosus, particularly in patients unable to take [[chloroquine]] derivatives.<ref name=drugsdotcom/>

As an intrapleural sclerosing agent, it is used as [[pneumothorax]] prophylaxis in patients at high risk of recurrence, e.g., cystic fibrosis patients.<ref name=drugsdotcom/>

Mepacrine is not the drug of choice because side effects are common, including [[Substance-induced psychosis|toxic psychosis]], and may cause permanent damage. See [[mefloquine]] for more information.

In addition to medical applications, mepacrine is an effective in vitro research tool for the epifluorescent visualization of cells, especially platelets. Mepacrine is a green fluorescent dye taken up by most cells. Platelets store mepacrine in dense granules.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wall JE, Buijs-Wilts M, Arnold JT, etal | title = A flow cytometric assay using mepacrine for study of uptake and release of platelet dense granule contents. | journal = Br J Haematol | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 380&ndash;385 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03315.x}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Its mechanism of action against [[protozoa]] is uncertain, but it is thought to act against the [[protozoan]]'s cell membrane.

It is known to act as a  [[Histamine N-methyltransferase|histamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] inhibitor.

It also inhibits [[NF-κB]] and activates [[p53]].

==History of uses==

===Antiprotozoal===
Mepacrine was initially approved in the 1930s as an [[antimalarial drug]]. It was used extensively during the [[second World War]] by Allied forces fighting in North Africa and the Far East to prevent malaria.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Baird JK | title = Resistance to chloroquine unhinges vivax malaria therapeutics. | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother | year = 2011 | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | pages = 1827&ndash;1830 | doi=10.1128/aac.01296-10 | pmid=21383088 | pmc=3088196}}</ref>

This [[antiprotozoal]] is also approved for the treatment of [[giardiasis]] (an [[intestinal parasite]]),<ref name="pmid17072963">{{cite journal |vauthors=Canete R, Escobedo AA, Gonzalez ME, Almirall P |title=Randomized clinical study of five days apostrophe therapy with mebendazole compared to quinacrine in the treatment of symptomatic giardiasis in children |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=12 |issue=39 |pages=6366–70 |year=2006 |pmid=17072963 |doi=}}</ref> and has been researched as an inhibitor of [[phospholipase A2]].

Scientists at [[Bayer]] in Germany first synthesised mepacrine in 1931. The product was one of the first synthetic substitutes for [[quinine]] although later superseded by [[chloroquine]].

===Anthelmintics===
In addition it has been used for treating [[tapeworm]] infections.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000956295|quinacrine}}</ref>

===Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease===
Mepacrine has been shown to bind to the [[prion]] protein and prevent the formation of prion aggregates ''[[in vitro]]'',<ref name="Doh-Ura">{{cite journal |vauthors=Doh-Ura K, Iwaki T, Caughey B | title = Lysosomotropic Agents and Cysteine Protease Inhibitors Inhibit Scrapie-Associated Prion Protein Accumulation | journal = J Virol | volume = 74 | issue = 10 | pages = 4894–7 |date=May 2000| pmid = 10775631 | url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/74/10/4894?view=long&pmid=10775631 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.74.10.4894-4897.2000 | pmc = 112015}}</ref>
and full clinical trials of its use as a treatment for [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] are under way in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Small trials in Japan have reported improvement in the condition of patients with the disease,<ref name="Kobayashi">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kobayashi Y, Hirata K, Tanaka H, Yamada T | title = [Quinacrine administration to a patient with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease who received a cadaveric dura mater graft--an EEG evaluation] | journal = Rinsho Shinkeigaku | volume = 43 | issue = 7 | pages = 403–8 |date=July 2003 | pmid = 14582366}}</ref>
although other reports have shown no significant effect,<ref name="Haik">{{cite journal |vauthors=Haïk S, Brandel J, Salomon D, Sazdovitch V, Delasnerie-Lauprêtre N, Laplanche J, Faucheux B, Soubrié C, Boher E, Belorgey C, Hauw J, Alpérovitch A | title = Compassionate use of quinacrine in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease fails to show significant effects | journal = Neurology | volume = 63 | issue = 12 | pages = 2413–5 |date=28 December 2004 | pmid = 15623716 | doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000148596.15681.4d}}</ref>

===Non-surgical sterilization for women ===
The use of mepacrine for non-surgical [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] for women has also been studied.  The first report of this method claimed a first year failure rate of 3.1%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zipper J, Cole LP, Goldsmith A, Wheeler R, Rivera M | title=Quinacrine hydrochloride pellets: preliminary data on a nonsurgical method of female sterilisation | journal=Asia Oceania J. Obstet. Gynaecol. | year=1980 | volume=18 | pages=275–90 |pmid=6109672 | issue=4}}</ref> However, despite a multitude of clinical studies on the use of mepacrine and female sterilization, no randomized, controlled trials have been reported to date and there is some controversy over its use.<ref name=drugsdotcom/>

[[Pelletizing|Pellets]] of mepacrine are inserted through the cervix into a woman's [[uterus|uterine cavity]] using a preloaded inserter device, similar in manner to [[Intrauterine device|IUCD]] insertion. The procedure is undertaken twice, first in the proliferative phase, 6 to 12 days following the first day of the menstrual cycle and again one month later. The [[sclerosing]] effects of the drugs at the utero-tubal junctions (where the [[Fallopian tubes]] enter the uterus) results in [[scar|scar tissue]] forming over a six-week interval to close off the tubes permanently.

In the United States, this method has undergone Phase I clinical testing.  The FDA has waived the necessity for Phase II clinical trials because of the extensive data pertaining to other uses of mepacrine.  The next step in the FDA approval process in the United States is a Phase III large multi-center clinical trial.  The method is currently used [[Off-label use|off-label]].

Many peer reviewed studies suggest that<ref>{{cite journal | author=International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics | title=Quinacrine Sterilization: Reports on 40,252 cases | journal=London: Elsevier. Vol 83 (Suppl. 2) | year=October 2003}}</ref> mepacrine sterilization (QS) is potentially safer than [[surgical sterilization]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sokal, D.C., Kessel. E., Zipper.
