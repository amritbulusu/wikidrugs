'''Thiram''' is a [[fungicide]], [[ectoparasiticide]], and animal repellent. It is used to prevent fungal diseases in seed and crops. It is also used as an animal repellent to protect fruit trees and ornamentals from damage by rabbits, rodents and deer.  It is effective against Stem gall of coriander, damping off, smut of millet, neck rot of onion, etc. Thiram has been used in the treatment of human scabies, as a sun screen and as a bactericide applied directly to the skin or incorporated into soap.<ref name=extoxnet>{{cite web | url = http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/pyrethrins-ziram/thiram-ext.html | title = Thiram | publisher = Extension Toxicology Network}}</ref>

== Usage ==
[[File:Thiram USA 2012.png|thumb|left|Map of agricultural use in the U.S. (2012)]]
Thiram was traditionally used in apple and wine farming. Since 2010 most Thiram is applied to soybeans.

==Chemical properties==
Thiram is a type of sulfur fungicide. It has been found to dissolve completely in chloroform, acetone and ether. It is available as dust, flowable, wettable powder, water dispersible granules, and water suspension formulations and in mixtures with other fungicides.<ref name=extoxnet/>

Thiram is nearly immobile in clay soils or in soils of high organic matter. It is not expected to contaminate groundwater because of its in-soil half life of 15 days and tendency to stick to soil particles.<ref>{{cite book | editor = Howard, P.H. | year = 1989 | title = Handbook of Environmental Fate and Exposure Data for Organic Chemicals | volume = Vol. III: Pesticides | publisher = Lewis Publishers | location = Chelsea, MI}}</ref>

As a waste, Thiram carries an EPA U244 code.

==Toxicity==
Thiram is moderately toxic by ingestion, but it is highly toxic if inhaled. Acute exposure in humans may cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints.<ref>{{cite book | editor = Hayes, W.J. and E.R. Laws | year = 1990 | title = Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology | volume = Vol. 3, Classes of Pesticides | publisher = Academic Press, Inc. | location = NY}}</ref>

Chronic or repeated exposure may cause sensitive skin, and it may have effects on the thyroid or liver.<ref>NIOSH [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0757.htmlCDC - Thiram International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC] July 22, 2015</ref>
