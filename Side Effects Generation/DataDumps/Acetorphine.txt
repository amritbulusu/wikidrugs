Acetorphine was developed in 1966 by the Reckitt research group that developed etorphine. Acetorphine was developed for the same purpose as etorphine itself, namely as a strong tranquilizer for use in immobilizing large animals in veterinary medicine. Despite showing some advantages over etorphine, for instance producing less toxic side effects in giraffes,<ref>{{ cite journal | author = UNODC | publisher = [[UNODC]] | journal = Bulletin on Narcotics | year = 1968 | volume = 1968 | issue = 2 | title = The case of etorphine and acetorphine | pages = 51–52 | url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1968-01-01_2_page009.html }}</ref> acetorphine was never widely adopted for veterinary use, and etorphine (along with other tranquilizers such as [[carfentanil]] and [[azaperone]]) remains the drug of choice in this application.
==Legal Status==
===United States===

Acetorphine is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States.  Its DEA Administrative Controlled Substances Control Number is 9319 and the one salt in use, acetorphine hydrochloride, has a freebase conversion ratio of 0.93.
===Australia===

Acetorphine is a schedule 9 substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (February 2017).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A schedule 9 drug is outlined in the [[Poisons Act 1964]] as "Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO." <ref>Poisons Act 1964 http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/pco/prod/FileStore.nsf/Documents/MRDocument:26063P/$FILE/Poisons%20Act%201964%20-%20%5B09-f0-04%5D.pdf?OpenElement</ref>
