'''Alfetamine''', or '''alpha-[[allyl]]-[[Phenyl|phen]][[Ethyl group|ethyl]][[amine]]''', is a chemical compound of the [[phenethylamine]] family. It was briefly investigated as a possible antidepressant in the early 1970s. Its activity profile was said to be very similar to [[imipramine]] and [[amitriptyline]], two [[tricyclic antidepressants]].<ref name="pharm eval">{{ cite journal |author1=Hitchens, J.
