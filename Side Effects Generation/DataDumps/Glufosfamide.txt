'''Glufosfamide''', also known as '''glucophosphamide''', '''<small>D</small>-glucose isophosphoramide mustard''', '''D-19575'''<ref>Mazur L, Opydo-Chanek M, Stojak M. Glufosfamide as a new oxazaphosphorine anticancer agent. Anticancer Drugs. 2011 Jul; 22 (6) :488-93. [[doi:10.1097/CAD.0b013e328345e1e0]], {{PMID|21427562}}.</ref> is an experimental cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of malignancies.

== Chemical structure ==
Glufosfamide is, basically, a [[glycoside|glycosidic]] conjugate between [[Glucose|β-<small>D</small>-glucose]] and the active alkylating moiety of the well-known antineoplasic drug [[ifosfamide]], so-called "isophosphoramide mustard".

== Theoretical advantages ==
Glufosfamide, being a conjugate of [[glucose]] and active alkylating moiety of [[ifosfamide]], has the better cell permeability than the parent compound — ifosfamide — or its metabolites. Glufosfamide utilizes the normal cell glucose transport mechanism (a sodium-dependent glucose/sodium co-transporter) for its own transport into the cell. And the glucose uptake mechanism is grossly overexpressed and upregulated in certain cancer cell lines, especially [[pancreatic cancer]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]], and [[glioblastoma multiforme]]. This, theoretically, should render them more sensitive to the alkylating effects of glufosfamide while relatively sparing (doing relatively little collateral damage) to the normal cells in which the glucose uptake mechanism is not so upregulated.<ref>Glufosfamide: beta-D-Glc -IPM, D 19575.Drugs R D. 2005, 6 (1) :49-52, {{PMID|15801867}}.</ref>

== Clinical trials ==
Glufosfamide has successfully passed Phase I and Phase II of clinical trials in the treatment of [[pancreatic cancer]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]] and recurrent [[glioblastoma multiforme]] and began Phase III trials.<ref>Liang J, Huang M, Duan W, Yu XQ, Zhou S. Design of new oxazaphosphorine anticancer drugs. Curr Pharm Des. 2007, 13 (9) :963-78, {{PMID|17430192}}.</ref> Subsequently, however, further development was discontinued by Baxter Oncology, without any clear explanation for the reason of discontinuation.
