'''Hexadimethrine bromide''' (commercial brand name Polybrene) is a [[cationic]] [[polymer]] used to increase the efficiency of [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] of certain cells with [[virus]] in [[cell culture]].<ref>{{cite  journal |author1=Howard e.

Polybrene in combination with DMSO shock is used to transfect some cell types such as NINH-3T3 and CHO.<ref name=":0" /> It has other uses, including a role in [[protein sequencing]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Historically, hexadimethrine bromide was sometimes used to reverse heparin anticoagulation during [[cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Its use has been supplanted by [[protamine sulfate]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Polybrene is also used in enzyme kinetic assays in order to reduce spontaneous activation of zymogens that are prone to auto activation.
