'''1,3-Benzodioxolyl-''N''-methylbutanamine''' ('''''N''-methyl-1,3-benzodioxolylbutanamine''', '''MBDB''', '''3,4-methylenedioxy-''N''-methyl-α-ethylphenylethylamine''') is an [[empathogen-entactogen|entactogen]] of the [[phenethylamine]] [[chemical class]]. It is known by the street names '''Eden''' and '''Methyl-J'''.<ref>https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mbdb/</ref>  MBDB is a closely related chemical [[Structural analog|analogue]] of [[MDMA]], with the only difference between the two [[molecule]]s being an [[ethyl group]] instead of a [[methyl group]] attached to the [[alpha carbon]]. It has IC<sub>50</sub> values of 784 nM against [[5-HT]], 7825 nM against [[dopamine]], and 1233 nM against [[norepinephrine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Its metabolism has been described in scientific literature.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708515300364 | title=Liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry for screening in vitro drug metabolites in humans: investigation on seven phenethylamine-based designer drugs | author=Foon Yin Lai | author2=Claudio Erratico | author3=Juliet Kinyua| author4=Jochen F.

MBDB was first synthesized by [[pharmacologist]] and [[medicinal chemist]] [[David E. Nichols]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and later tested by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and described in his book, ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story]]''. MBDB's dosage, according to ''PiHKAL'', is 180–210&nbsp;mg; the proper dosage relative to body mass seems unknown. Its duration is 4–6 hours, with noticeable after-effects lasting for 1–3 hours.

MBDB was initially developed as a non-psychedelic entactogen. It has lower effects on the [[dopamine]] system in comparison to other entactogens such as [[MDMA]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} MBDB causes many mild, MDMA-like effects, such as lowering of social barriers and inhibitions, pronounced sense of [[empathy]] and [[compassion]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] lift, and mild [[euphoria]] are all present.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} MBDB tends to produce less euphoria, psychedelia, and stimulation in comparison.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Legal Status==
Unlike MDMA, MBDB is not internationally scheduled under the United Nations [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The thirty-second meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (September 2000) evaluated MBDB and recommended against scheduling.<ref>WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_903.pdf Thirty-second Report], Technical Report Series 903 (2001)</ref> From the WHO Expert Committee assessment of MBDB: 
:''Although MBDB is both structurally and pharmacologically similar to MDMA, the limited available data indicate that its stimulant and euphoriant effects are less pronounced than those of MDMA. There have been no reports of adverse or toxic effects of MBDB in humans. Law enforcement data on illicit trafficking of MBDB in Europe suggest that its availability and abuse may now be declining after reaching a peak during the latter half of the 1990s. For these reasons, the Committee did not consider the abuse liability of MBDB would constitute a significant risk to public health, thereby warranting its placement under international control. Scheduling of MBDB was therefore not recommended.''

===Australia===
MBDB is considered a Schedule 9 Prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" />

===Russia===
MBDB is included into  Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. [https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBDB]

===Sweden===
[[Riksdag|''Sveriges riksdags'']] health ministry [[:sv:Statens folkhälsoinstitut|''Statens folkhälsoinstitut'']] classified MBDB as "health hazard" under the act [[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|''Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor'']] (translated ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'') as of Feb 25, 1999,  in their regulation SFS 1999:58 listed as "2-metylamino-1-(3,4-metylendioxifenyl)-butan (MBDB)", making it illegal to sell or possess.<ref>http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/sfs/19990058.pdf</ref>
