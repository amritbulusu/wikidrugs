'''Ancestim''' is a recombinant methionyl human [[stem cell factor]], branded by [[Amgen]] as StemGen.  It was developed by Amgen and sold to Biovitrium, now [[Swedish Orphan Biovitrum]], in December, 2008.<ref name=BiovitriumDeal>Amgen press office. [http://www.amgen.com/media/biovitrum_amgen_deal.html Biovitrum Closes Product Acquisition Deal with Amgen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703015728/http://www.amgen.com/media/biovitrum_amgen_deal.html |date=July 3, 2012 }}</ref>

It is a 166 amino acid protein produced by [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] bacteria into which a gene has been inserted for soluble human [[stem cell factor]].<ref name="pmid15322567">{{cite journal |vauthors=da Silva MG, Pimentel P, Carvalhais A |title=Ancestim (recombinant human stem cell factor, SCF) in association with filgrastim does not enhance chemotherapy and/or growth factor-induced peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization in patients with a prior insufficient PBPC collection |journal=Bone Marrow Transplant. |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=683â€“91 |year=2004 |pmid=15322567 |doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1704602|display-authors=etal}}</ref> It has a monomeric molecular weight of approximately 18,500 daltons and normally exists as a noncovalently associated dimer. The protein has an [[amino acid]] sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human [[DNA]] sequence analysis, except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine retained after expression in [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]. Because Ancestim is produced in [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], it is nonglycosylated. Ancestim is supplied as a sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilised powder for reconstitution and administration as a subcutaneous (SC) injection and is indicated for use in combination with [[filgrastim]] for mobilizing peripheral [[hematopoietic stem cells]] for later [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|transplanation]] in certain cancer patients.<ref>[http://www.sobi.com/en/Healthcare-Professionals/Products-alphabetical-list/Stemgen/ Sobi's StemGen page]]</ref>
