<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Flunitrazepam''', also known as '''Rohypnol''' among other names,<ref name=generics/> is an intermediate acting [[benzodiazepine]] used in some countries to treat severe [[insomnia]] and in fewer, early in [[anesthesia]].<ref name="NSW-PSB">{{cite web|url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/pharmaceutical/Documents/guide-flunitraz-alpraz.pdf|format=PDF|title=Prescribing of Benzodiazepines Alprazolam and Flunitrazepam|work=Pharmaceutical Services Branch|publisher=New South Wales Health|date=November 2013}}</ref>

Just as with other hypnotics, flunitrazepam should be strictly used only on a short-term basis or by those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis.<ref name="NSW-PSB"/> Flunitrazepam has been referred to as a [[date rape drug]] even though its incidence is very rare in reported rape cases.<ref name=EU>European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction [http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/benzodiazepine Benzodiazepines drug profile]. Page last updated January 8, 2015</ref> Along with [[GHB]], [[MDMA]] and [[ketamine]], Rohypnol is considered to be a [[club drug]], due to its recreational use by dancers at [[rave]]s, [[nightclub]]s and [[electronic dance music]] festivals.

==Use==
In countries where the drug is still used, it is used for treatment of insomnia, and in some countries to begin anesthesia as well;<ref name="NSW-PSB"/><ref name=Japan/> these were also the indications in which it was originally studied.<ref>Mattila MA, Larni HM. Flunitrazepam: a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use. Drugs. 1980 Nov;20(5):353-74. {{PMID|6108205}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects of flunitrazepam include dependence, both physical and psychological; reduced sleep quality resulting in [[somnolence]]; and [[overdose]], resulting in excessive sedation, impairment of balance and speech, respiratory depression or coma, and possibly death. Because of the latter, flunitrazepam is commonly used in suicide.{{cn|date=June 2017}} When used in pregnancy, it might cause [[hypotonia]].

===Dependence===
Flunitrazepam as with other [[benzodiazepine]]s can lead to [[drug dependence]] and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].<ref name=CESAR/> Discontinuation may result in the appearance of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal symptoms]] when the drug is discontinued. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] characterised by [[seizures]], [[psychosis]], insomnia, and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. [[Rebound insomnia]], worse than baseline insomnia, typically occurs after discontinuation of flunitrazepam even after short-term single nightly dose therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Kales A |author2=Scharf MB |author3=Kales JD |author4=Soldatos CR |date = April 20, 1979 |title = Rebound insomnia. A potential hazard following withdrawal of certain benzodiazepines |journal = Journal of the American Medical Association |volume = 241 |issue = 16 |pages = 1692–5 |pmid = 430730 |doi = 10.1001/jama.241.16.1692 }}</ref>

===Sleep depth===
{{medref|section|date=October 2017}}
Flunitrazepam produces a decrease in [[delta wave]] activity. The effect of benzodiazepine drugs on delta waves, however, may not be mediated via benzodiazepine receptors. Delta activity is an indicator of depth of sleep within non-REM sleep; increased levels of delta sleep reflects better quality of sleep. Thus, flunitrazepam and other benzodiazepines{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} cause a deterioration in sleep quality. [[Cyproheptadine]] may be superior to benzodiazepines in the treatment of insomnia as it enhances sleep quality based on [[EEG]] studies.

===Paradoxical effects===
Flunitrazepam may cause a [[paradoxical reaction]] in some individuals causing symptoms including anxiety, [[aggressiveness]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[confusion]], [[disinhibition]], loss of [[impulse control]], talkativeness, [[violent]] behavior, and even [[convulsions]]. [[Paradoxical adverse effects]] may even lead to [[criminal behaviour]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bramness JG, Skurtveit S, Mørland J |title=Flunitrazepam: psychomotor impairment, agitation and paradoxical reactions |journal = Forensic Science International |volume=159 |issue=2–3 |pages=83–91 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16087304 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.06.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0379-0738(05)00392-0}}</ref>

===Hypotonia===
{{See also|Hypotonia}}
Benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam are lipophilic and rapidly penetrate membranes and, therefore, rapidly cross over into the [[placenta]] with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines including flunitrazepam in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in hypotonia, also known as floppy baby syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Kanto JH |date=May 1982 |title = Use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy, labour and lactation, with particular reference to pharmacokinetic considerations |journal = Drugs |volume = 23 |issue = 5 |pages = 354–80 |pmid = 6124415 |doi = 10.2165/00003495-198223050-00002 }}</ref>

===Other===
Flunitrazepam impairs [[cognitive]] functions. This may appear as lack of concentration, [[confusion]] and [[anterograde amnesia]]. It can be described as a [[hangover]]-like effect which can persist to the next day.<ref name=Residual2004>{{cite journal |author = Vermeeren A. |year = 2004 |title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications |journal = CNS Drugs |volume = 18 |issue = 5 |pages = 297–328 |pmid = 15089115 |doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref> It also impairs psychomotor functions similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] drugs; falls and hip fractures were frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.<ref name="Mets-2010">{{Cite journal |last1 = Mets |first1 = MA. |last2 = Volkerts |first2 = ER. |last3 = Olivier |first3 = B. |last4 = Verster |first4 = JC. |title = Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness |journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume = 14 |date=February 2010 |issue = 4 |pages = 259–67 |doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 |pmid = 20171127 }}</ref>

Other adverse effects include:
* Slurred speech
* [[Gastrointestinal disturbance]]s, lasting 12 or more hours
* Vomiting
* [[Respiratory depression]] in higher doses
;Special precautions
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and in individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1 = Authier |first1 = N. |last2 = Balayssac |first2 = D. |last3 = Sautereau |first3 = M. |last4 = Zangarelli |first4 = A. |last5 = Courty |first5 = P. |last6 = Somogyi |first6 = AA. |last7 = Vennat |first7 = B. |last8 = Llorca |first8 = PM. |last9 = Eschalier |first9 = A. <!--exactly 9 authors--> |title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome |journal = Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises |volume = 67 |issue = 6 |pages = 408–13 |date=November 2009 |doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 |pmid = 19900604 }}</ref>

Impairment of driving skills with a resultant increased risk of [[road traffic accidents]] is probably the most important adverse effect. This side-effect is not unique to flunitrazepam but also occurs with other [[hypnotic]] drugs. Flunitrazepam seems to have a particularly high risk of road traffic accidents compared to other hypnotic drugs. Extreme caution should be exercised by drivers after taking flunitrazepam.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustavsen I, Bramness JG, Skurtveit S, Engeland A, Neutel I, Mørland J |title=Road traffic accident risk related to prescriptions of the hypnotics zopiclone, zolpidem, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam |journal= Sleep Medicine |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=818–22 |date=December 2008 |pmid=18226959 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2007.11.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389-9457(07)00424-8}}</ref><ref name=UKdrivingregs2014>UK Dept. of Transport. July 2014. [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/325275/healthcare-profs-drug-driving.pdf Guidance for healthcare professionals on drug driving]</ref>

==Interactions==
The use of flunitrazepam in combination with alcoholic beverages synergizes the adverse effects, and can lead to [[toxicity]] and death.<ref name=EU/>

==Overdose==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine overdose}}
Flunitrazepam is a drug that is frequently involved in drug intoxication, including overdose.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Zevzikovas, A |author2=Kiliuviene G |author3=Ivanauskas L |author4=Dirse V. |year = 2002 |title = Analysis of benzodiazepine derivative mixture by gas-liquid chromatography |journal = Medicina (Kaunas) |volume = 38 |issue = 3 |pages = 316–20 |pmid = 12474705 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jonasson B, Saldeen T |title=Citalopram in fatal poisoning cases |journal = Forensic Science International |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11955823 |doi= 10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00632-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0379073801006326}}</ref> Overdose of flunitrazepam may result in excessive sedation, or impairment of [[proprioception|balance]] or speech. This may progress in severe overdoses to [[respiratory depression]] or coma and possibly death. The risk of overdose is increased if flunitrazepam is taken in combination with CNS [[depressants]] such as [[ethanol]] (alcohol) and [[opioid]]s. Flunitrazepam overdose responds to the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist [[flumazenil]], which thus can be used as a treatment.

==Detection==
As of 2016, blood tests can identify flunitrazepam at concentrations of as low as 4&nbsp;ng/ml; the elimination half life of the drug is 11–25 hours. For urine samples, metabolites can be identified 60 hours to 28 days, depending on the dose and analytical method used. Hair and saliva can also be analyzed; hair is useful when a long time has transpired since ingestion, and saliva for workplace drug tests.<ref name=Kiss2016/>

Flunitrazepam can be measured in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma flunitrazepam concentrations are usually in a range of 5–20 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically as a nighttime hypnotic, 10–50 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving and 100–1000 μg/L in victims of acute fatal overdosage. Urine is often the preferred specimen for routine drug abuse monitoring purposes. The presence of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, a pharmacologically-active metabolite and ''in vitro'' degradation product, is useful for confirmation of flunitrazepam ingestion. In postmortem specimens, the parent drug may have been entirely degraded over time to 7-aminoflunitrazepam.<ref>Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC. Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results. Ther. Drug Monit. 29: 248–260, 2007.</ref><ref>Robertson MD, Drummer OH. Stability of nitrobenzodiazepines in postmortem blood. J. For. Sci. 43: 5–8, 1998.</ref><ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 633–635.</ref> Other metabolites include [[desmethylflunitrazepam]] and [[nifoxipam|3-hydroxydesmethylflunitrazepam]].

==Pharmacology==
The main pharmacological effects of flunitrazepam are the enhancement of GABA at various [[GABA receptors]].<ref name=EU/>

While 80% of flunitrazepam that is taken orally is absorbed, bioavailability in suppository form is closer to 50%.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Cano J. P. |authorlink = |author2=Soliva, M. |author3=Hartmann, D. |author4=Ziegler, W. H. |author5=Amrein, R. |title =Bioavailability from various galenic formulations of flunitrazepam |journal = Arzneimittelforschung |volume =27 |issue =12 |pages =2383–8 |publisher = |year =1977 |id = rohypnol |pmid = 23801 }}</ref>

Flunitrazepam has a long half-life of 18–26 hours, which means that flunitrazepam's effects after nighttime administration persist throughout the next day.<ref name=Residual2004/>

Flunitrazepam is [[lipophilic]] and is metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. The enzyme [[CYP3A4]] is the main enzyme in its [[phase 1 metabolism]] in human liver microsomes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hesse LM, Venkatakrishnan K, von Moltke LL, Shader RI, Greenblatt DJ |date = February 1, 2001 |title = CYP3A4 Is the Major CYP Isoform Mediating the in Vitro Hydroxylation and Demethylation of Flunitrazepam |journal = Drug Metabolism & Disposition |volume = 29 |issue = 2 |pages = 133–40 |url= http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/2/133 |pmid = 11159802 }}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Flunitrazepam is classed as a nitro-benzodiazepine. It is the [[fluorine|fluorinated]] ''N''-methyl derivative of [[nitrazepam]]. Other nitro-benzodiazepines include nitrazepam (the parent compound), [[nimetazepam]] (methylamino derivative) and [[clonazepam]] (2ʹ-chlorinated derivative).<ref>{{cite journal |author = Robertson MD |author2=Drummer OH |date=May 1995 |title = Postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria |journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume = 40 |issue = 3 |pages = 382–6 |pmid = 7782744 }}</ref>

==History==
Flunitrazepam was discovered at [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] as part of the benzodiazepine work led by [[Leo Sternbach]]; the patent application was filed in 1962 and it was first marketed in 1974.<ref>Erika M Alapi and Janos Fischer.

Due to abuse of the drug for [[date rape drug|date rape]] and recreation, in 1998 Roche modified the formulation to give lower doses, make it less soluble, and add a blue dye for easier detection in drinks.<ref name=Kiss2016>Kiss, B et al.

==Society and culture==

===Recreational and illegal uses===
[[File:Hypnodorm.jpg|thumb|Hypnodorm 1 mg flunitrazepam tabs, Australia]]
[[File:rohypnol2.jpg|thumb|Rohypnol]]

====Recreational use====
Rohypnol is considered to be a [[club drug]], due to its use by dancers at [[rave]]s, nightclubs and [[electronic dance music]] festivals. A 1989 journal on ''Clinical Pharmacology'' reports that benzodiazepines accounted for 52% of prescription forgeries, suggesting that benzodiazepines was a major prescription drug class of abuse. [[Nitrazepam]] accounted for 13% of forged prescriptions.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Bergman U |author2=Dahl-Puustinen ML. |year = 1989 |title = Use of prescription forgeries in a drug abuse surveillance network |volume = 36 |issue = 6 |pages = 621–3 |pmid = 2776820 |journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |doi = 10.1007/BF00637747}}</ref>

Flunitrazepam and other sedative hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines ([[anxiolytic]] or [[hypnotic]]) such as [[zolpidem]] and [[zopiclone]] (as well as [[cyclopyrrolones]], [[imidazopyridine]]s, and [[pyrazolopyrimidine]]s) are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines and similar drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Jones AW |author2=Holmgren A |author3=Kugelberg FC. |date=April 2007 |title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results |volume = 29 |issue = 2 |pages = 248–60 |pmid = 17417081 |journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring |doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31803d3c04}}</ref>

====Suicide====
In studies in [[Sweden]], flunitrazepam was the second most common drug used in suicides, being found in about 16% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jonasson B, Jonasson U, Saldeen T |title=Among fatal poisonings dextropropoxyphene predominates in younger people, antidepressants in the middle aged and sedatives in the elderly |journal= Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=7–10 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10641912}}</ref> In a retrospective Swedish study of 1587 deaths, in 159 cases benzodiazepines were found. In suicides when benzodiazepines were implicated, the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and [[nitrazepam]] were occurring in significantly higher concentrations, compared to natural deaths. In 4 of the 159 cases, where benzodiazepines were found, benzodiazepines alone were the only cause of death. It was concluded that flunitrazepam and nitrazepam might be more toxic than other benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ericsson HR, Holmgren P, Jakobsson SW, Lafolie P, De Rees B| date = November 10, 1993 |title = Benzodiazepine findings in autopsy material. A study shows interacting factors in fatal cases |journal = Läkartidningen |volume = 90 |issue = 45 |pages = 3954–7 |pmid = 8231567 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Drummer OH, Syrjanen ML, Cordner SM |title=Deaths involving the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam. |journal=The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=238–243 |date=September 1993 |pmid=8311057 |doi=10.1097/00000433-199309000-00012}}</ref>

====Drug-facilitated sexual assault====
{{Main article|Drug facilitated sexual assault}}
Flunitrazepam is known to induce [[anterograde amnesia]] in sufficient doses; individuals are unable to remember certain events that they experienced while under the influence of the drug. This effect could be particularly dangerous if flunitrazepam is used to aid in the commission of [[sexual assault]]; victims may be unable to clearly recall the assault, the assailant, or the events surrounding the assault.<ref name=Kiss2016/>

While use of flunitrazepam in sexual assault has been prominent in the media, as of 2015 appears to be fairly rare, and use of alcohol and other benzodiazepine drugs in date rape appears to be a larger but underreported problem.<ref name=EU/>

====Drug-facilitated robbery====
In the United Kingdom, the use of flunitrazepam and other "date rape" drugs have been connected to stealing from sedated victims. An activist quoted by a British newspaper estimated that up to 2,000 individuals are robbed each year after being spiked with powerful sedatives,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,2763,1376956,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title='Rape drug' used to rob thousands |first=Tony |last=Thompson |date=December 19, 2004 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> making drug-assisted robbery a more commonly reported problem than drug-assisted rape.

Flunitrazepam is also known to induce [[anterograde amnesia]] making police interrogations more difficult.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bankrånare stärkte sig med Rohypnol?|publisher=DrugNews|url=http://drugnews.nu/article.asp?id=199}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mijailovic var påverkad av våldsdrog|publisher=Sydsvenskan |url=http://sydsvenskan.se/sverige/article62213.ece}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mijailovic var påverkad av våldsdrog|publisher=Expressen|url=http://www.expressen.se/index.jsp?d=737&a=116288}}</ref>
