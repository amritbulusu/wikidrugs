'''Istaroxime''' is an investigational drug originally patented and developed by the [[Italy|Italian]] pharmaceutical company Sigma-Tau. Istaroxime is now under development for treatment of acute decompensated heart failure by CVie Therapeutics, a Taiwanese pharmaceutical company owned by Lee's Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited that in July 2012 has acquired from Sigma-Tau the patents and rights on Istaroxime and related compounds. It is still in early-stage development, having been evaluated in phase two clinical trials.<ref name="Shah">Shah, S.J., MD, Blair, J.E.A., Filippatos, G.S., Macarie, C., Ruzyllo, W., Korewicki, J., Bubenek-Turconi, S.I., Ceracchi, M., Bianchetti, M., Carminati, P., Kremastinos, D., Grzybowski, J., Valentini, G., Sabbah, H.N., Gheorghiade, M. 2009.

==Mechanism of action==
Istaroxime is a positive inotropic agent<ref name="Mattera" /> that mediates its action through inhibition of sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase).<ref name="Rocchetti_a">Rocchetti, M., Besana, A., Mostacciuolo, G., Micheletti, R., Ferrari, P., Sarkozi, S., Szegedi, C., Jona, I., and Zaza, A. 2005.

Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 326: 957-965.</ref> Additionally, Istaroxime increases intracellular calcium by improving the efficacy by which intracellular calcium triggers sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release,<ref name="Micheletti" /><ref name="Rocchetti" /> and by accelerating the inactivation state of L-type calcium channels, which allow for calcium influx.<ref name="Rocchetti_b">Rocchetti, M., Besana, A., Mostacciuolo, G., Ferrari, P., Micheletti, R., and Zaza, A. 2003. Diverse Toxicity Associated with Cardiac Na+/K+ Pump Inhibition: Evaluation of Electrophysiological Mechanisms. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 305: 765-771.</ref> Together the changes in calcium handling increase cell contraction.

Istaroxime also enhances the heart’s relaxation phase<ref name="Micheletti" /> by increasing the rate of intracellular calcium sequestration by Sarco/endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase, isotype 2a (SERCA2a).<ref name="Rocchetti" /> SERCa2a is inhibited by phospholamban and higher phospholamban-to-SERCA2a ratios cause SERCA inhibition and impaired relaxation.<ref name="Micheletti" /> Istaroxime reduces SERCA2a-phospholamban interaction,<ref name="Micheletti" /><ref name="Rocchetti" /> and increases SERCA2a affinity for cytosolic calcium.<ref name="Rocchetti_a" /> Studies on failing human heart tissue show that Istaroxime increases SERCA2a activity up to 67%.<ref name="Micheletti" />

==Clinical use==
Clinical trials show that Istaroxime improves ejection fraction, stroke volume and systolic blood pressure, while also enhancing ventricular filling.<ref name="Shah" />  The drug also reduces heart rate and ventricular diastolic stiffness.<ref name="Shah" /> Contrary to available inotropic therapies, Istaroxime may permit cytosolic calcium accumulation while avoiding a proarrhythmic state.<ref name="Micheletti" /><ref name="Rocchetti_b" /><ref name="Adamson">Adamson, P.B., Vanoli, E., Mattera, G.G., Germany, R., Gagnol, J., Carminati, P., and Schwartz, P.J. 2003.

Istaroxime’s lusitropic effect facilitates its wider margin of safety, as patients can receive higher doses without signs of arrhythmias.<ref name="Adamson" />
