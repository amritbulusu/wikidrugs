'''Tyrosine''' ('''Tyr''' or '''Y''')<ref>{{cite web | author=IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | title=Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides | work=Recommendations on Organic & Biochemical Nomenclature, Symbols & Terminology
| year = 1983 | url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/ | accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> or '''4-hydroxyphenylalanine''' is one of the 20 standard [[amino acid]]s that are used by [[cell (biology)|cells]] to [[protein biosynthesis|synthesize]] [[protein]]s. It is a [[non-essential amino acid]] with a polar side group. Its [[codon]]s are UAC and UAU.  The word "tyrosine" is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tyros'', meaning ''[[cheese]]'', as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist [[Justus von Liebig]] in the protein [[casein]] from cheese.<ref name="urltyrosine — Infoplease.com">{{cite web | url = http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/sci/A0849873.html | title = Tyrosine  | author = | authorlink = | vauthors = | year = 2007 | work = The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed | publisher = Infoplease.com — Columbia University Press  | pages = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-04-20}}</ref><ref name="urlOnline Etymology Dictionary">{{cite web | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tyrosine | title = Tyrosine | author = Douglas Harper | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2001 | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher = | pages = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-04-20}}</ref> It is called '''tyrosyl''' when referred to as a [[functional group]] or side chain. Tyrosine is a hydrophilic amino acid and is significantly more soluble in water than its precursor, [[phenylalanine]], due to the thermodynamic favorability of the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of one molecule of tyrosine and the carboxyl group of another.

==Functions==
Aside from being a [[proteinogenic amino acid]], tyrosine has a special role by virtue of the [[phenol]] functionality.  It occurs in proteins that are part of [[signal transduction]] processes.  It functions as a receiver of phosphate groups that are transferred by way of [[protein kinase]]s (so-called [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]s).  Phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group changes the activity of the target protein.

A tyrosine residue also plays an important role in [[photosynthesis]]. In [[chloroplast]]s ([[photosystem II]]), it acts as an electron donor in the [[Redox|reduction]] of oxidized [[chlorophyll]].  In this process, it loses the hydrogen atom of its phenolic OH-group.  This radical is subsequently reduced in the photosystem II by the four core manganese clusters.

==Dietary requirements and sources==
{{Disputed-section|date=August 2017}}
The [[Dietary Reference Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)]] for phenylalanine and tyrosine is 33&nbsp;mg per kilogram of body weight, or 15&nbsp;mg per pound.<ref name=HF>[http://www.healthaliciousness.com/articles/high-tyrosine-foods.php Top 10 Foods Highest in Tyrosine]</ref> For a 70&nbsp;kg person this is 2310&nbsp;mg (phenylalanine + tyrosine).

Tyrosine, which can also be synthesized in the body from [[phenylalanine]], is found in many high-[[protein]] food products such as [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Turkey (food)|turkey]], [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[milk]], [[yogurt]], [[cottage cheese]], [[cheese]], [[peanut]]s, [[almond]]s, [[pumpkin seed]]s, [[sesame seed]]s, [[soy products]], [[lima bean]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[bananas]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tyrosine|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/tyrosine-000329.htm|work=University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2016 }} For example, the white of an egg has about 250&nbsp;mg per egg,<ref name="HF" /> while lean beef/lamb/pork/salmon/chicken/turkey contains about 1000&nbsp;mg per {{Convert|3|oz|g}} portion.<ref name="HF" />

== Biosynthesis ==
[[Image:Tyrosine biosynthesis.svg|thumb|center|400px|Plant biosynthesis of tyrosine from [[shikimic acid]].]]

In plants and most microorganisms, '''tyr''' is produced via [[prephenic acid|prephenate]], an intermediate on the [[shikimate pathway]].  Prephenate is [[oxidative decarboxylation|oxidatively decarboxylated]] with retention of the [[hydroxyl]] group to give ''p''-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is [[transamination|transaminated]] using [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and [[Alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|α-ketoglutarate]].

[[Mammal]]s synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid [[phenylalanine]] ('''phe'''), which is derived from food.  The conversion of '''phe''' to '''tyr''' is catalyzed by the [[enzyme]] [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]], a monooxygenase.  This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of [[phenylalanine]], such that it becomes tyrosine.

==Metabolism==

[[File:Conversion of phenylalanine and tyrosine to its biologically important derivatives.png|center|thumb|800px|Conversion of phenylalanine and tyrosine to its biologically important derivatives.]]

===Phosphorylation and sulfation ===
Some of the tyrosine residues can be ''tagged'' (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group ([[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]]) by [[protein kinase]]s. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called '''phosphotyrosine'''. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity.  Phosphotyrosine can be detected through specific [[antibody|antibodies]].  Tyrosine residues may also be modified by the addition of a sulfate group, a process known as [[tyrosine sulfation]].<ref name="pmid17046811">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoffhines AJ, Damoc E, Bridges KG, Leary JA, Moore KL | title = Detection and purification of tyrosine-sulfated proteins using a novel anti-sulfotyrosine monoclonal antibody | journal = J.

Like the phosphotyrosine antibodies mentioned above, antibodies have recently{{clarify|date=January 2015}} been described that specifically detect sulfotyrosine.

===Precursor to neurotransmitters and hormones===
In dopaminergic cells in the [[brain]], tyrosine is converted to [[L-DOPA]] by the [[enzyme]] [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] (TH).  TH is the [[rate-limiting enzyme]] involved in the synthesis of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]]. Dopamine can then be converted into other [[catecholamine]]s, such as [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline).

The [[thyroid]] hormones [[triiodothyronine]] (T<sub>3</sub>) and [[thyroxine]] (T<sub>4</sub>) in the [[colloid]] of the [[thyroid]] also are derived from tyrosine.
{{Phenylalanine biosynthesis|caption=Tyrosine is a precursor to trace amine compounds and the catecholamines.}}

=== Precursor to alkaloids===
The latex of ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', the opium poppy, has been shown to convert tyrosine into the [[alkaloid]] [[morphine]] and the bio-synthetic pathway has been established from tyrosine to morphine by using Carbon-14 radio-labelled tyrosine to trace the in-vivo synthetic route.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Precursor to natural phenols ===
[[Tyrosine ammonia lyase]] (TAL) is an enzyme in the natural phenols biosynthesis pathway. It transforms L-tyrosine into [[p-coumaric acid]].

=== Precursor to pigments ===
Tyrosine is also the precursor to the pigment ''[[melanin]]''.

=== Role in coenzyme Q10 synthesis ===
Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of [[coenzyme Q10]].

=== Degradation ===
[[Image:Tyrosinedegradation2.png|thumb|center|750px|The decomposition of tyrosine to [[acetoacetic acid|acetoacetate]] and [[fumarate]].  Two dioxygenases are necessary for the decomposition path.  The end products can then enter into the [[citric acid cycle]].]]

<!-- This path is described in Stryer reference -->
The decomposition of L-tyrosine (syn. ''para''-hydroxyphenylalanine) begins with an α-ketoglutarate dependent [[transamination]] through the [[tyrosine transaminase]] to [[para-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate|''para''-hydroxyphenylpyruvate]].  The positional description ''para'', abbreviated ''p'', mean that the hydroxyl group and side chain on the phenyl ring are across from each other (see the illustration below).
 
The next oxidation step catalyzes by [[p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase|''p''-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase]] and splitting off CO<SUB>2</SUB> [[homogentisic acid|homogentisate]] (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate).  In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, [[homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase]] is required.  Thereby, through the incorporation of a further O<SUB>2</SUB> molecule, [[maleylacetoacetate]] is created.
   
[[Fumarylacetoacetate]] is created by [[4-maleylacetoacetate cis-trans-isomerase|maleylacetoacetate ''cis''-''trans''-isomerase]] through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation.  This ''cis-trans''-isomerase contains [[glutathione]] as a [[coenzyme]].  Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split by the enzyme [[fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase]] through the addition of a water molecule.

Thereby [[fumarate]] (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and [[acetoacetic acid|acetoacetate]] (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated.  Acetoacetate is a [[ketone body]], which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into [[acetyl-CoA]], which in turn can be oxidized by the [[citric acid cycle]] or be used for [[fatty acid synthesis]].

[[Phloretic acid]] is also a urinary metabolite of tyrosine in rats.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = A N | last2 = Masri | first2 = M S | last3 = Robbins | first3 = D J | last4 = Emerson | first4 = O H | last5 = Jones | first5 = F T | last6 = Deeds | first6 = F | year = 1960 | title = Urinary phenolic acid metabolities of tyrosine | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/235/9/2649.citation | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 235 | issue = 9| pages = 2649–2652 }}</ref>

Three [[structural isomers]] of L-tyrosine are known.  In addition to the common amino acid L-tyrosine, which is the [[para isomer]] (''para''-tyr, ''p''-tyr or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), there are two additional regioisomers, namely '''''meta''-tyrosine'''<!--these terms redirect here - bolded per MOS:BOLD--> (also known as {{nowrap|'''3-hydroxyphenylalanine'''}}, '''L-''m''-tyrosine''', and ''m''-tyr) and ''ortho''-tyrosine (''o''-tyr or 2-hydroxyphenylalanine), that occur in nature.  The ''m''-tyr and ''o''-tyr isomers, which are rare, arise through non-enzymatic [[free-radical]] hydroxylation of phenylalanine under conditions of [[oxidative stress]].<ref name="pmid16221230">{{cite journal | vauthors = Molnár GA, Wagner Z, Markó L, Kó Szegi T, Mohás M, Kocsis B, Matus Z, Wagner L, Tamaskó M, Mazák I, Laczy B, Nagy J, Wittmann I | title = Urinary ortho-tyrosine excretion in diabetes mellitus and renal failure: evidence for hydroxyl radical production | journal = Kidney Int. | volume = 68 | issue = 5 | pages = 2281–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16221230 | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00687.x }}</ref><ref name="pmid16298866">{{cite journal | vauthors = Molnár GA, Nemes V, Biró Z, Ludány A, Wagner Z, Wittmann I | title = Accumulation of the hydroxyl free radical markers meta-, ortho-tyrosine and DOPA in cataractous lenses is accompanied by a lower protein and phenylalanine content of the water-soluble phase | journal = Free Radic.
