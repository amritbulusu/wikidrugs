<!-- Definition and uses -->
'''Hydrochlorothiazide''' ('''HCTZ''' or '''HCT''') is a [[diuretic]] medication often used to treat [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[edema|swelling due to fluid build up]].<ref name=AHFS2015/> Other uses include [[diabetes insipidus]], [[renal tubular acidosis]], and to decrease the risk of [[kidney stone]]s in those with [[hypercalciuria|high calcium level in the urine]].<ref name=AHFS2015/> For high blood pressure it is often recommended as a first line treatment.<ref name=AHFS2015/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=JM|last2=Musini|first2=VM|title=First-line drugs for hypertension.| journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews| date=8 July 2009| issue=3| pages=CD001841| pmid=19588327| doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001841.pub2}}</ref> HCTZ is taken by mouth and may be combined with other [[blood pressure medication]]s as a single pill to increase the effectiveness.<ref name=AHFS2015>{{cite web| title=Hydrochlorothiazide| url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/hydrochlorothiazide.html| publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists| accessdate=2016-11-30| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510121613/https://www.drugs.com/monograph/hydrochlorothiazide.html| archivedate=2017-05-10| df=}}</ref>

<!-- Side effects -->
Potential side effects include poor kidney function, [[electrolyte imbalance]]s especially [[hypokalemia|low blood potassium]] and less commonly [[hyponatremia|low blood sodium]], [[gout]], [[hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]], and [[orthostatic hypotension|feeling faint initially upon standing up]].<ref name=AHFS2015/> While [[allergy|allergies]] to HCTZ are reported to occur more often in those with allergies to [[sulfa drugs]], this association is not well supported.<ref name=AHFS2015/> It may be used during pregnancy but is not a first line medication in this group.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

<!-- Mechanism -->
It is in the [[thiazide]] medication class and acts by decreasing the [[kidney]]s' ability to retain water.<ref name=AHFS2015/> This initially reduces [[blood]] volume, decreasing blood return to the heart and thus [[cardiac output]].<ref name=Du2010/> Long term, however, it is believed to lower peripheral [[vascular resistance]].<ref name=Du2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Duarte JD, Cooper-DeHoff RM |title=Mechanisms for blood pressure lowering and metabolic effects of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics |journal=Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=793–802 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20528637 |pmc=2904515 |doi=10.1586/erc.10.27 |url=}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Hydrochlorothiazide is frequently used for the treatment of [[hypertension]], [[congestive heart failure]], symptomatic [[edema]], ''[[diabetes insipidus]]'', [[renal tubular acidosis]].<ref name=AHFS2015/> It is also used for the prevention of kidney stones in those who have high levels of calcium in their urine.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

Most of the research supporting the use of thiazide diuretics in hypertension was done using [[chlorthalidone]], a different medication in the same class. Some more recent studies have suggested that chlorthalidone might be the more effective thiazide diuretic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Messerli|first=Franz|author2=Makani, Harikrishna|author3=Benjo, Alexandre|author4=Romero, Jorge|author5=Alviar, Carlos|author6=Bangalore, Sripal|date=2011|title=Antihypertensive Efficacy of Hydrochlorothiazide as Evaluated by Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials|journal=J.Am.Coll.Cardiol.|volume=57|issue=5|pages=590–600|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2010.07.053}}<!--|accessdate=2014-04-19--></ref>

It is also sometimes used for treatment of [[hypoparathyroidism]],<ref>{{cite web| last=Mitchell| first=Deborah| title=Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients with Hypoparathyroidism| url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/97/12/4507.abstract?sid=fe7910aa-6cf0-4768-b8af-75d9bff57967| work=J Clin Endocrin Metab| publisher=Endocrine Society| accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> [[hypercalciuria]], [[Dent's disease]], and [[Ménière's disease]]. For ''diabetes insipidus'', the effect of thiazide diuretics is presumably mediated by a hypovolemia-induced increase in proximal sodium and water reabsorption, thereby diminishing water delivery to the ADH-sensitive sites in the collecting tubules and increasing the urine osmolality.

Thiazides are also used in the treatment of [[osteoporosis]]. Thiazides decrease mineral bone loss by promoting calcium retention in the kidney, and by directly stimulating [[osteoblast]] differentiation and bone mineral formation.<ref name="pmid17656470">{{cite journal |author=Dvorak MM |title=Thiazide diuretics directly induce osteoblast differentiation and mineralized nodule formation by targeting a NaCl cotransporter in bone |journal=J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=2509–16 |year=2007 |pmid=17656470 |doi=10.1681/ASN.2007030348 |url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17656470 |pmc=2216427 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=De Joussineau C |author3=Carter DH |display-authors=3 |last4=Pisitkun |first4=T. |last5=Knepper |first5=M.

It may be given together with other antihypertensive agents in fixed-dose combination preparations, such as in [[losartan/hydrochlorothiazide]] (see below).

==Adverse effects==
* [[Hypokalemia]], or low blood levels of potassium are an occasional side effect. It can be usually prevented by [[potassium]] supplements or by combining hydrochlorothiazide with a [[potassium-sparing diuretic]]
* Other disturbances in the levels of serum electrolytes including [[hypomagnesemia]] (low magnesium), [[hyponatremia]] (low sodium), and [[hypercalcemia]] (high calcium)
* [[Hyperuricemia]], high levels of uric acid in the blood
* [[Hyperglycemia]], high blood sugar
* [[Hyperlipidemia]], high cholesterol and triglycerides
* [[Headache]]
* [[Nausea]]/[[vomiting]]
* [[Photosensitivity]]
* [[Weight gain]]
* [[Gout]]
* [[Pancreatitis]]

These side effects increase with the dose of the medication and are most common at doses of greater than 25&nbsp;mg per day.

Package inserts, based on case reports and observational studies, have reported that an allergy to a [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa drug]] predisposes the patient to cross sensitivity to a thiazide diuretic. A 2005 review of the literature did not find support for this cross-sensitivity.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Johnson| first=KK |author2=Green, DL |author3=Rife, JP |author4=Limon, L|title=Sulfonamide cross-reactivity: fact or fiction?| journal=The Annals of pharmacotherapy|date=February 2005| volume=39| issue=2| pages=290–301| doi=10.1345/aph.1E350|pmid=15644481}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to [[thiazide]] class of [[diuretic]]s. It reduces blood volume by acting on the [[kidneys]] to reduce [[sodium]] (Na<sup>+</sup>) reabsorption in the [[distal convoluted tubule]]. The major site of action in the nephron appears on an electroneutral NaCl co-transporter by competing for the chloride site on the transporter. By impairing Na<sup>+</sup> transport in the distal convoluted tubule, hydrochlorothiazide induces a [[natriuresis]] and concomitant water loss. Thiazides increase the reabsorption of calcium in this segment in a manner unrelated to sodium transport.<ref>Uniformed Services University Pharmacology Note Set #3 2010, Lectures #39 & #40, Eric Marks</ref> Additionally, by other mechanisms, HCTZ is believed to lower peripheral vascular resistance.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=2904515| pmid=20528637| year=2010|last1=Duarte| first1=JD| last2=Cooper-Dehoff| first2=RM|title=Mechanisms for blood pressure lowering and metabolic effects of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics| volume=8| issue=6|pages=793–802| doi=10.1586/erc.10.27|journal=Expert review of cardiovascular therapy}} NIHMSID: NIHMS215063</ref>
