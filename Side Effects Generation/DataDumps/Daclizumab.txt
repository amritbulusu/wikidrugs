'''Daclizumab''' (trade name '''Zinbryta''', by [[Biogen]]) is a therapeutic humanized [[monoclonal antibody]] used for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS). Daclizumab works by binding to [[CD25]], the alpha subunit of the [[IL-2 receptor]] of [[T-cells]].

It was formerly marketed under the trade name '''Zenapax''' to prevent acute [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] in people with [[kidney]] transplants along with cyclosporine and corticosteroids but marketing of the drug for that purpose was discontinued in 2009 due to lack of market demand.

==Medical uses==
Daclizumab is used to treat adults with relapsing forms of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name=BLAapproval>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2016/761029Orig1s000ltr.pdf BLA Approval letter] May 27, 2016</ref>  It is administered subcutaneously.<ref name=2015rev>Lycke J.

Review. {{PMID|26600872}} [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643868/ PMC 4643868]</ref>

In clinical trials it showed 45% decrease in annualized relapse rate, a 41% reduction in the proportion of patients who relapsed, and a 54% reduction in the number of new lesions.<ref name=2015rev/>

===Discontinued use===
Daclizumab was approved and used to prevent acute rejection of kidney transplant, along with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.<ref name=RejectionLabel>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2005/103749s5059lbl.pdf Rejection label] Supplement label update September 2005</ref>  For that indication, side effects with a frequency of at least 10% included sleeplessness, [[tremor]], headache, [[arterial hypertension]], [[dyspnoea]], gastrointestinal side effects and [[oedema]]. In rare cases, the drug could cause severe [[anaphylaxis]].<ref name="EPAR">{{cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/000198/WC500057570.pdf|title=EPAR for Zenapax|publisher=European Medicines Agency|year=2007}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
In the US, daclizumab is contraindicated in people with liver impairment, including significantly elevated liver enzymes ([[Alanine transaminase|ALT]], [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]]) and [[autoimmune hepatitis]].<ref>{{Drugs.com|pro|zinbryta}} for Zinbryta.</ref> The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) originally approved the drug without any contraindications apart from known [[hypersensitivity]],<ref name="AC" /> but required Biogen to implement a hepatic risk management guide for physicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/003862/WC500210598.pdf|title=Zinbryta Summary of Product Characteristics|publisher=European Medicines Agency|year=2016}}</ref> In July 2017, the EMA has issued a provisional contraindication for patients with pre-existing liver disease or liver impairment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Referrals_document/Zinbryta_20/Under_evaluation/WC500230924.pdf|title=Zinbryta Article-20 referral - Summary of provisional measures|publisher=European Medicines Agency|date=20 July 2017}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
In clinical trials for MS, there were no treatment-related deaths or increased risk of cancer; side effects that occurred more frequently with daclizumab versus interferon included infections (65% versus 57%), skin rashes (37% versus 19%) and liver complications  (approximately 18% versus 12%).<ref name=2015rev/>

==Interactions==
As an antibody, daclizumab is expected to have a very low potential for [[pharmacokinetic]] interactions with other drugs.<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2016|language=German}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Daclizumab blocks IL-2 receptors containing the alpha subunit (CD25), which include the high-affinity receptors. Medium-affinity receptors, on the other hand, consist of two beta subunits ([[CD122]]) and are not affected by daclizumab. While the exact mechanism is unknown, the net effect is a reduction of T-cell responses and expansion of [[CD56]]<sup>bright</sup> [[natural killer cell]]s.<ref name="AC" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
After [[subcutaneous injection]] of a single dose, daclizumab has a [[bioavailability]] of about 90% and reaches highest [[blood plasma]] levels after 5 to 7 days. Given every four weeks, steady state concentrations are found after the fourth dose. It is expected that daclizumab, like other antibodies, is degraded by [[protease]]s to peptides and finally amino acids, and that it does not interact with [[cytochrome P450]] liver enzymes.<ref name="AC" />

The [[biological half-life]] is 21 days. Patients who developed antibodies against daclizumab eliminated it 19% faster.<ref name="AC" />

==History==
Daclizumab was created by scientists at [[PDL BioPharma]] (called "Protein Design Labs" at that time) by [[humanized monoclonal antibody|humanizing]] the mouse mAb called anti-Tac, which targets [[CD25]], the IL-2 receptor α chain; it blocks the interaction of [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] with the IL-2 receptor and prevents activation of [[T cells]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tsurushita | first1 = N.| last2 = Hinton | first2 = P.
