Diprenorphine is the strongest opioid antagonist that is commercially available (some 100 times more potent as an antagonist than [[nalorphine]]),<ref>Furst S, Hosztafi S, Friedmann T. Structure-Activity Relationships of Synthetic and Semisynthetic Opioid Agonists and Antagonists. ''Current Medicinal Chemistry'', 1995; 1(6):423-440. {{ISSN|0929-8673}}</ref> and is used for reversing the effects of very strong opioids for which the binding affinity is so high that [[naloxone]] does not effectively or reliably reverse the narcotic effects.<ref>Takemori AE, Hayashi G, Smits SE. Studies on the quantitative antagonism of analgesics by naloxone and diprenorphine. ''European Journal of Pharmacology''. 1972 Oct;20(1):85-92. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014299972902191 Abstract.]</ref> These super-potent opioids, with the single exception of [[buprenorphine]] (which has an improved safety-profile due to its partial agonism character<ref>[http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/buprenorphine SAMHSA.gov, ''Medication Assisted Treatment'' 2015 Sept.;25(1):1]</ref>), are not used in humans because the dose for a human is so small that it would be difficult to measure properly, so there is an excessive risk of [[overdose]] leading to fatal [[respiratory depression]]. However conventional opioid derivatives are not strong enough to rapidly tranquilize large animals, like elephants and rhinos, so drugs such as etorphine and carfentanil are available for this purpose.

Diprenorphine is considered to be the specific reversing agent/antagonist for etorphine and carfentanil,<ref>Jessup DA, Clark WE, Jones KR, Clark R, Lance WR. Immobilization of free-ranging desert bighorn sheep, tule elk, and wild horses, using carfentanil and xylazine: reversal with naloxone, diprenorphine, and yohimbine. ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association''. 1985 Dec 1;187(11):1253-4.</ref> and is normally used to remobilise animals once veterinary procedures have been completed.<ref>Alford BT, Burkhart RL, Johnson WP. Etorphine and diprenorphine as immobilizing and reversing agents in captive and free-ranging mammals. ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association''. 1974 Apr 1;164(7):702-5.</ref> Since diprenorphine also has partial agonistic properties of its own, it should not be used on humans in the event that they are accidentally exposed to etorphine or carfentanil. Naloxone or naltrexone is the preferred human opioid receptor antagonist.<ref>Caulkett NA, Arnemo JM. Chemical Immobilization of Free-Ranging Terrestrial Mammals. In: Tranquilli WJ, Thurmon JC, Grimm KA, eds. Lumb and Jones' Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2007. 815.</ref>

In theory, diprenorphine could also be used as an antidote for treating overdose of certain opioid derivatives which are used in humans, particularly [[buprenorphine]] for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not reliably reverse the narcotic effects. However, diprenorphine is not generally available in hospitals; instead a vial of diprenorphine is supplied with etorphine or carfentanil specifically for reversing the effects of the drug, so the use of diprenorphine for treating a buprenorphine overdose is not usually carried out in practice.

Because diprenorphine is a weak partial agonist of the [[opioid receptor]]s rather than a [[silent antagonist]], it can produce some opioid effects in the absence of other opioids at sufficient doses.<ref name="WolfensohnLloyd2008">{{cite book|author1=Sarah Wolfensohn|author2=Maggie Lloyd|title=Handbook of Laboratory Animal Management and Welfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVqjrZ7yQ2cC&pg=PA110|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-4777-4|pages=110–}}</ref> Moreover, due to partial agonism of the KOR, where it appears to possess significantly greater [[intrinsic activity]] relative to the MOR, diprenorphine can produce [[sedation]] as well as, in humans, [[hallucination]]s.<ref name="BiegonVolkow1995"/><ref name="ClarkeTrim2013" /><ref name="MillerFowler2011">{{cite book|author1=R.
