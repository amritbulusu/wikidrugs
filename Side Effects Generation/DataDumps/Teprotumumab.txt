'''Teprotumumab''' (RG-1507) is an experimental human monoclonal antibody developed by [[Genmab]] and [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]]. It binds to [[IGF-1R]].

Teprotumumab was first investigated for the treatment of solid and hematologic tumors, including [[breast cancer]], Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's [[lymphoma]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]] and sarcoma.<ref>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01868997</ref><ref>http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800015801</ref> Although results of phase I and early phase II trials showed promise, research for these indications were discontinued in 2009 by Roche. Phase II trials still in progress were allowed to complete, as the development was halted due to business prioritization rather than safety concerns.

Teprotumumab was subsequently licensed to River Vision Development Corporation in 2012 for research in the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. [[Horizon Pharma]] acquired RVDC in 2017, and will continue clinical trials.<ref>http://www.genmab.com/product-pipeline/products-in-development/teprotumumab</ref> It is in phase II trials for [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]] and phase I for [[diabetic macular edema]].<ref>http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800015801</ref> It was granted [[Orphan Drug]] Status by the FDA for Graves' ophthalmopathy.<ref>http://www.genmab.com/product-pipeline/products-in-development/teprotumumab</ref>

In a multicenter randomized trial in patients with active Graves' ophthalmopathy Teprotumumab was more effective than placebo in reducing the clinical activity score and proptosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=TJ|last2=Kahaly|first2=GJ|last3=Ezra|first3=DG|last4=Fleming|first4=JC|last5=Dailey|first5=RA|last6=Tang|first6=RA|last7=Harris|first7=GJ|last8=Antonelli|first8=A|last9=Salvi|first9=M|last10=Goldberg|first10=RA|last11=Gigantelli|first11=JW|last12=Couch|first12=SM|last13=Shriver|first13=EM|last14=Hayek|first14=BR|last15=Hink|first15=EM|last16=Woodward|first16=RM|last17=Gabriel|first17=K|last18=Magni|first18=G|last19=Douglas|first19=RS|title=Teprotumumab for Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy.|journal=The New England journal of medicine|date=4 May 2017|volume=376|issue=18|pages=1748â€“1761|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1614949|pmid=28467880}}</ref>
