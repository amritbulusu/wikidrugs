'''Pentazocine''', sold under the brand name '''Talwin''' among others, is a [[analgesic|painkiller]] used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is believed to work by activating (agonizing) [[kappa opioid receptor|κ-opioid receptors]] (KOR) and blocking (antagonizing) [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptors]] (MOR). As such it is called an [[opioid]] as it delivers its effects on pain by interacting with the opioid receptors. It shares many of the side effects of other opioids like constipation, nausea, itching, drowsiness and a reduced effort to breathe, but unlike most other opioids it fairly frequently causes [[hallucinations]], nightmares and [[delusions]]. It is also, unlike most other opioids, subject to a ceiling effect, which is when at a certain dose (which differs from person-to-person) no more pain relief, or side effects, is obtained by increasing the dose any further.<ref name="mart"/>

Chemically it is classed as a [[benzomorphan]] and it comes in two [[enantiomers]], which are molecules that are exact mirror images of one another.

Usually, in its oral formulations, it is combined with naloxone so as to prevent people from crushing the tablets, dissolving them in a solvent (like water) and injecting them for a high (as naloxone, if taken by mouth, produces no effects. If injected, however, it does).<ref name = mart/>

==Use==

===Medical===
Pentazocine is used primarily to treat pain, although its analgesic effects are subject to a ceiling effect.<ref name="BNF">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-85711-084-8 | title = British National Formulary (BNF) | last1 = Joint Formulary Committee | year = 2013 | publisher = Pharmaceutical Press | location = London, UK | edition = 65  | pages =  }}</ref> It has been discontinued by its corporate sponsor in [[Australia]], although it may be available through the special access scheme.<ref name = mart/>

===Recreational===
In the 1970s, recreational drug users discovered that combining pentazocine with [[tripelennamine]] (a first-generation ethylenediamine [[antihistamine]] most commonly dispensed under the brand names Pelamine and Pyribenzamine) produced a euphoric sensation. Since tripelennamine tablets are typically blue in color and brand-name Pentazocine is known as Talwin (hence "Ts"), the pentazocine/tripelennamine combination acquired the [[slang]] name ''Ts and blues''.
After health-care professionals and drug-enforcement officials became aware of this scenario, the [[mu opioid receptor|mu-opioid]]-[[antagonist]] [[naloxone]] was added to oral preparations containing pentazocine to prevent perceived "misuse" via injection,<ref name=monotabsnalox>{{ cite web | url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=a28450a0-ac93-4235-b9a6-58cdf24773cb | title = Pentazocine and Naloxone tablets | work = DailyMed | publisher = National Institute of Health | accessdate = 2011-12-10 }}</ref> and the reported incidence of its recreational use has declined precipitously since.

===Research===
In an open-label, add-on, single-day, acute-dose small clinical study, pentazocine was found to rapidly and substantially reduce symptoms of [[mania]] in individuals with [[bipolar disorder]] that were in the manic phase of the condition.<ref name="ChartoffMavrikaki2015">{{cite journal|last1=Chartoff|first1=Elena H.|last2=Mavrikaki|first2=Maria|title=Sex Differences in Kappa Opioid Receptor Function and Their Potential Impact on Addiction|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|volume=9|year=2015|issn=1662-453X|doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00466|pmid=26733781|pmc=4679873}}</ref> It was postulated that the efficacy observed was due to [[κ-opioid receptor]] activation-mediated amelioration of [[dopamine|hyperdopaminergia]] in the [[reward pathway]]s.<ref name="ChartoffMavrikaki2015" /> Minimal [[sedation]] and no [[side effect]]s including [[psychotomimetic]] effects or worsening of [[psychosis]] were observed at the dose administered.<ref name="ChartoffMavrikaki2015" />

==Adverse effects==
[[Image:pentazocine.jpg|frame|right]]
Side effects are similar to those of [[morphine]], but pentazocine, due to its action at the kappa opioid receptor is more likely to invoke [[psychotomimetic]] effects.<ref name = BNF/> High dose may cause [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] or [[tachycardia|high heart rate]].<ref name = mart>{{cite web|title=Pentazocine|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|place=London, UK|date=9 January 2017|accessdate=1 September 2017|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-6251-l.htm|editor=Brayfield, A}}</ref> It may also increase cardiac work after [[myocardial infarction]] when given intravenously and hence this use should be avoided where possible.<ref name = mart/> [[Respiratory depression]] is a common side effect, but is subject to a ceiling effect, such that at a certain dose the degree of respiratory depression will no longer increase with dose increases.<ref name = mart/> Likewise rarely it has been associated with [[agranulocytosis]], [[erythema multiforme]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]].<ref name = mart/>

===Tissue damage at injection sites===
Severe injection site necrosis and sepsis has occurred (sometime requiring amputation of limb) with multiple injection of pentazocine lactate. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated that Pentazocine is tolerated less well subcutaneously than intramuscularly.<ref name=mono>{{ cite web | url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=1d225639-c326-4d9e-bc8d-e380e7958b8f | title = TALWIN (pentazocine lactate) injection, solution | work = DailyMed | publisher = National Institute of Health | accessdate = 2011-12-10 }}</ref>

==History==
Pentazocine was developed by the [[Sterling Drug]] Company, Sterling-Winthrop Research Institute, of [[Rensselaer, New York]]. It was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in June 1967 after being  favorably  reviewed following testing on 12,000 patients in the [[United States]]. The [[analgesic]] compound was first made at Sterling in 1958. U.S. testing was conducted between 1961 and 1967. By mid 1967 Pentazocine was already being sold in [[Mexico]], [[England]], and [[Argentina]], under different trade names.<ref name=talwin>''Pain-Killing Drug Approved By F.D.A.'', [[New York Times]], June 27, 1967, pg. 41.</ref>

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
Pentazocine was originally classified in Schedule V under the Controlled Substances Act but a petition was filed with the D.E.A. on October 1, 1971, to shift it to Schedule III. The petition was filed by Joseph L. Fink III, a pharmacist and law student at Georgetown University Law Center as part of the course Lawyering in the Public Interest. That petition was accepted for review on November 10, 1971<ref>36 Fed.Reg. 217</ref> D.E.A. published a Final Rule transferring it to schedule IV on January 10, 1979, with an effective date of February 9, 1979<ref>44 Fed. Reg. 2169</ref> This is understood to be the first instance of a successful petition to reclassify a substance under the relatively recently enacted Controlled Substances Act. Pentazocine is still classified in [[Schedule IV (US)|Schedule IV]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in the [[United States]], even with the addition of Naloxone. although some states classify it in Schedule III.  Internationally, pentazocine is a Schedule III drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.incb.org/documents/Psychotropics/greenlist/2016/V1604744_Eng.pdf | title = List of psychotropic substances under international control | work = Green List - Annex to the annual statistical report on psychotropic substances (form P) | edition = 27th  |date=2016 | publisher = International Narcotics Control Board }}</ref>  Pentazocine has a DEA ACSCN of 9720; being a Schedule IV substance, the DEA does not assign an annual manufacturing quota for pentazocine for the United States.

===Brand names===
Pentazocine is sold under several brand names, such as Fortral, Sosegon, Talwin NX (with naloxone), Talwin, Talwin PX, Fortwin and Talacen (with [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen)).
