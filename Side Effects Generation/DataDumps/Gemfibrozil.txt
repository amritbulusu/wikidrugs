'''Gemfibrozil''' is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|generic name]] for an oral drug used to lower [[lipid]] levels. It belongs to a group of drugs known as [[fibrates]].  It is most commonly sold as the brand name, '''Lopid'''. Other brand names include '''Jezil''' and '''Gen-Fibro'''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Development history == 
Gemfibrozil was selected from a series of related compounds synthesized in the laboratories of the American company [[Parke Davis]] in the late 1970s. It came from research for compounds that lower plasma lipid levels in humans and in animals.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Rodney |first=G|date=1976 |title=The Hypolipidemic Effect of Gemfibrozil (CI-719) in Laboratory Animals |journal=Proc. roy. Soc. Med.|publisher=|volume=69 (Supplement 2) |issue= |pages=6–9 |pmc=1864017 |pmid=828263|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

== Actions ==
The exact mechanism of action of gemfibrozil is unknown, however, several theories exist regarding the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) effect; it can inhibit lipolysis and decrease subsequent hepatic fatty acid uptake as well as inhibit hepatic secretion of VLDL; together these actions decrease serum VLDL levels; increases HDL-cholesterol; the mechanism behind HDL elevation is currently unknown.

== Therapeutic effects ==
*Reduce [[triglyceride]] levels <ref>"Gemfibrozil." WebMD.com Accessed 14 June 2014. http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-11423-gemfibrozil+oral.aspx</ref>
*Reduce [[very low density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) levels
*Modest reduction of [[low density lipoprotein]] (LDL) levels
*Moderate increase in [[high density lipoprotein]] (HDL) levels

== Nontherapeutic effects and toxicities ==
*GI distress
*Musculoskeletal [[pain]]
*Increased incidence of [[gallstone]]
*[[Hypokalemia]] (low blood potassium)
*Increased risk of [[cancer]]

== Indications ==
*[[Hyperlipidemia]] (Type III): Gemfibrozil is the drug of choice for therapy.
*[[Hypertriglyceridemia]] (Type IV): Gemfibrozil, though not as effective as [[niacin]], is better tolerated.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Contraindications and precautions ==
*Gemfibrozil should not be given to these patients:{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
**Hepatic dysfunction
*Gemfibrozil should be used with caution in these higher risk categories:{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
**Biliary tract disease
**Renal dysfunction
**Pregnant women
**Obese patients

== Drug interactions ==
*Anticoagulants: Gemfibrozil potentiates the action of [[warfarin]] and indanedione anticoagulants.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
*Statin drugs: Concomitant administration of fibrates (including gemfibrozil) with statin drugs increases the risk of muscle cramping, [[myopathy]], and [[rhabdomyolysis]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
*Gemfibrozil inhibits the activation of the liver's [[Cytochrome P450]] system and CYP2C8, reducing [[hepatic]] metabolism of many drugs, and prolonging their half lives and duration of action.
** Drugs metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system include:
*** Many [[antidepressant]]s
*** Many [[antipsychotic]]s
*** Many [[antiepileptic]]s
*** [[Theophylline]] and other methylxanthine drugs
*** Several anesthetic agents
*** [[Oral contraceptive pill]]s
*** [[Statin]]s
*** [[Warfarin]]
*** Selexipag

==Environmental data==
Gemfibrozil has been detected in [[biosolids]] (the solids remaining after wastewater treatment) at concentrations up to 2650&nbsp;ng/g wet weight.<ref>http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/tnsss-overview.cfm</ref> This indicates that it survives the wastewater treatment process.
