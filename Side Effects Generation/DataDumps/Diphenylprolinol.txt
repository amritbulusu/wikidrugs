'''Diphenylprolinol''' ('''D2PM'''), or (''R''/''S'')-(±)-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinyl-methanol, is a [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] which is used as a [[designer drug]].<ref>{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Wood DM, etal | title = Detection of the novel recreational drug Diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol (D2PM) sold legally in combination with 1-Benzylpiperzaine (BZP) | journal = Clinical Toxicology | date= 2008 | volume = 46 | pages = 393 | doi = 10.1080/15563650802071703 | pmid=18568796}}</ref><ref>[http://www.forensic-toxicology.org/Drug%20Trends%20&%20New%20Designer%20Drugs_Susie%20Davies.pdf Davies S.

==Pharmacology==
The dextrorotary (''R'')-(+)-[[enantiomer]] is the most pharmacologically active, although a variety of related derivatives have been studied.<ref>{{US patent reference | url = http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=XycDAAAAEBAJ&dq=5925666 | inventor = Paul F.

Side effects including chest pain (suggestive of possible cardiovascular toxicity) have been seen following recreational use of diphenylprolinol, although it was combined with [[glaucine]] in a [[party pill]] product, thus making it impossible to say for certain which drug was responsible.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lidder | first1 = S | last2 = Dargan | first2 = P | last3 = Sexton | first3 = M | last4 = Button | first4 = J | last5 = Ramsey | first5 = J | last6 = Holt | first6 = D | last7 = Wood | first7 = D | title = Cardiovascular toxicity associated with recreational use of diphenylprolinol (diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol D2PM) | journal = Journal of Medical Toxicology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–9 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18821489 | doi=10.1007/bf03161195}}</ref>

== Other uses ==
Diphenylprolinol can be used to prepare the chiral [[CBS catalyst]], which is used for [[enantioselective]] organic synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00252a056 |author1=Corey, E.
