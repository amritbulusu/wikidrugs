Irreversible MAOIs can cause unpleasant and occasionally dangerous side effects such as a [[hypertensive crises]] after intake of food or drink containing indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines such as [[tyramine]]. This is sometimes referred to as the 'cheese effect'. These side effects are due to irreversible inhibition of MAO in the gut and vasomotor neurones. However, the reversible MAOI antidepressants such as moclobemide have a very different side effect profile in this regard.<ref name="pmid7905288"/> The reversible binding to MAO-A by moclobemide allows amines such as tyramine to displace moclobemide from MAO-A allowing its metabolism and removing the risk of a hypertensive crisis that occurs with irreversible MAO inhibition.<ref name="Lavian-1993">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lavian | first1 = G. | last2 = Finberg | first2 = JP. | last3 = Youdim | first3 = MB. | title = The advent of a new generation of monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants: pharmacologic studies with moclobemide and brofaromine | journal = Clin Neuropharmacol | volume = 16 Suppl 2 | pages = S1–7 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8313392 }}</ref> Of 2300 people in multiple clinical trials who were treated with moclobemide in doses up to 600&nbsp;mg with no dietary restrictions, none experienced a tyramine-mediated [[hypertensive]] reaction.<ref name="pmid2123366"/> As the pressor effect of moclobemide is so low, dietary restrictions are not necessary in people eating a normal diet, in contrast to irreversible MAOIs.<ref name="pmid8875133"/> However, some rare cheeses that have a high tyramine level may possibly cause a pressor effect and require caution.<ref name="pmid3283290">{{cite journal |vauthors=Da Prada M, Zürcher G, Wüthrich I, Haefely WE |title=On tyramine, food, beverages and the reversible MAO inhibitor moclobemide |journal=J.

==Animal toxicology==
* Acute toxicity: The oral {{LD50}} values in mouse and rat are quite high, indicating a wide [[therapeutic index]]. LD<sub>50</sub> for mice is 730&nbsp;mg/kg and for rats 1,300&nbsp;mg/kg. In dogs doses in excess of 300&nbsp;mg/kg led to [[vomiting]], [[salivation]], [[ataxia]], and [[drowsiness]].
* Chronic toxicity: In an 18-months-study in rats with 10&nbsp;mg/kg no signs of chronic toxicity were noted, with 50&nbsp;mg/kg and 250&nbsp;mg/kg only a slight loss of weight, and with 250&nbsp;mg/kg mildly elevated [[Alkaline phosphatase]] and [[Gamma-GT]]. Studies in dogs revealed no toxicity relevant for humans. No evidence for a possible [[hepatic]] or [[cardiovascular]] toxicity was found.

==History==
Irreversible MAOI antidepressants were discovered accidentally in the 1950s but their popularity declined as their toxicity especially their dangerous food interactions became apparent and rival tricyclic antidepressants were discovered. Reversible MAOIs were developed in the hope that they would exert efficacy in depressive disorders but with less of the toxicity of the older irreversible compounds; moclobemide's discovery and marketing brought the renewed interest in MAOIs due to an absence of dangerous [[tyramine]] food interactions and potent antidepressant effects.<ref name="pmid1394027">{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth M, Guelfi JD |title=The efficacy of reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors in depressive illness |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=37 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=18–24 |date=September 1992 |pmid=1394027 }}</ref><ref name="pmid1609042">{{cite journal |author=Rudorfer MV |title=Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: reversible and irreversible |journal=Psychopharmacol Bull |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=45–57 |year=1992 |pmid=1609042 }}</ref> In 1992 moclobemide was launched onto the world markets.<ref name="pmid7593735">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hilton S, Jaber B, Ruch R |title=Moclobemide safety: monitoring a newly developed product in the 1990s |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=15 |issue=4 Suppl 2 |pages=76S–83S |date=August 1995 |pmid=7593735 |doi=10.1097/00004714-199508001-00013}}</ref> Moclobemide was the first reversible MAO-A inhibitor to be widely marketed;<ref name="pmid9005342">{{cite journal |vauthors=Volz HP, Gleiter CH, Möller HJ |title=[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors in psychiatry.

The discovery of moclobemide in 1972 in Switzerland,<ref name="pmid10063483"/> as an antidepressant came about after it was initially investigated as a possible lipid lowering drug or antibiotic; when tests failed to demonstrate any antibiotic or [[antilipaemic]] properties; it was then tested for anti-cholinergic properties to see if it was a possible antidepressant but these tests also proved negative, leading researchers to think it may, in fact, be an antipsychotic; finally its reversible MAO-A properties as well as its lack of tyramine pressor effect. Clinical trials were commenced for moclobemide's effectiveness in the treatment of depression.<ref name="pmid8923103">{{cite journal |vauthors=Angst J, Amrein R, Stabl M |title=Moclobemide: a paradigm of research in clinical psychopharmacology |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=11 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=3–7 |date=June 1996 |pmid=8923103 |doi=10.1097/00004850-199606003-00002}}</ref> It was first approved in the UK and Europe as the first reversible and selective inhibitor of MAO-A and is now approved in over 50 countries worldwide.<ref name="pmid10063483"/> Subsequent research found that moclobemide is well tolerated in elderly patients<ref name="pmid9469236">{{cite journal |vauthors=Amrein R, Stabl M, Henauer S, Affolter E, Jonkanski I |title=Efficacy and tolerability of moclobemide in comparison with placebo, tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in elderly depressed patients: a clinical overview |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=1043–50 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9469236 |doi=10.1177/070674379704201005 }}</ref> and far superior to tricyclic antidepressants in terms of side effects/tolerability as well as being much safer in overdose; with regard to effectiveness in the treatment of depression, moclobemide was determined to be as effective as all major antidepressant drug classes. There is no need for dietary restrictions in contrast to people on irreversible MAOIs and apart from an important interaction with other serotonergic enhancing agents such as SSRIs and pethidine, there are few serious drug interactions; because of these benefits of moclobemide over existing antidepressant drugs, moclobemide became regarded as a beneficial addition to medical 'prescribing arsenal'.<ref name="pmid8255982"/><ref name="pmid8253702">{{cite journal |author=Bech P |title=Acute therapy of depression |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=54 Suppl |issue= |pages=18–27; discussion 28 |date=August 1993 |pmid=8253702 }}</ref> Additionally moclobemide was found, unlike most other antidepressants on the market, to actually improve all aspects of sexual function.<ref name="pmid9696909">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chebili S, Abaoub A, Mezouane B, Le Goff JF |title=[Antidepressants and sexual stimulation: the correlation] |language=French |journal=Encephale |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=180–4 |year=1998 |pmid=9696909 }}</ref> It is the only reversible MAOI in use in clinical practice.<ref name="pmid7905288"/> The fact that moclobemide's pharmacokinetic properties are unaltered by age, that cognition is improved in the elderly, and moclobemide has low potential for food and drug interactions opened up a new avenue for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="pmid7905288"/> Due to a lack of financial incentive, such as the costs of conducting the necessary trials to gain approval, moclobemide is unavailable in the USA pharmaceutical market.<ref name="pmid10063483"/>
