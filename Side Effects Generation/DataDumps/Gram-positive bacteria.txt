'''Gram-positive bacteria''' are [[bacteria]] that give a positive result in the [[Gram stain]] test, which is traditionally used to quickly classify bacteria into two broad categories according to their cell wall.  

Gram-positive bacteria take up the [[crystal violet]] stain used in the test, and then appear to be purple-coloured when seen through a microscope. This is because the thick [[peptidoglycan]] layer in the bacterial [[cell wall]] retains the [[stain (biology)|stain]] after it is washed away from the rest of the sample, in the decolorization stage of the test.

[[Gram-negative bacteria]] cannot retain the violet stain after the decolorization step; alcohol used in this stage degrades the outer membrane of gram-negative cells making the cell wall more porous and incapable of retaining the crystal violet stain. Their peptidoglycan layer is much thinner and sandwiched between an inner cell membrane and a [[bacterial outer membrane]], causing them to take up the [[counterstain]] ([[safranin]] or [[fuchsine]]) and appear red or pink.

Despite their thicker peptidoglycan layer, gram-positive bacteria are more receptive to [[antibiotics]] than gram-negative, due to the absence of the outer membrane.

In general, the following characteristics are present in gram-positive bacteria:<ref name="Brock">{{cite book|author = Madigan M; Martinko J (editors).|title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms|edition = 11th|publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall|year = 2006|isbn = 0131443291}}</ref>

# Cytoplasmic lipid membrane
# Thick [[peptidoglycan]] layer
# [[Teichoic acids]] and lipoids are present, forming [[lipoteichoic acid]]s, which serve as [[Chelation|chelating]] agents, and also for certain types of adherence.
# Peptidoglycan chains are cross-linked to form rigid cell walls by a bacterial enzyme [[DD-transpeptidase]].
# A much smaller volume of [[periplasm]] than that in gram-negative bacteria.

Only some species have a [[bacterial capsule|capsule]] usually consisting of [[polysaccharides]]. Also only some species are [[flagellate]]s, and when they do have [[flagellum|flagella]] they only have two [[basal body]] rings to support them (gram-negative have four). Both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly have a surface layer called an [[S-layer]]. In gram-positive bacteria, the S-layer is attached to the peptidoglycan layer (in gram-negative bacteria, the S-layer is attached directly to the [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]]). Specific to gram-positive bacteria is the presence of [[teichoic acid]]s in the cell wall. Some of these are lipoteichoic acids, which have a lipid component in the cell membrane that can assist in anchoring the peptidoglycan.

== Classification ==

Along with [[Bacterial cell structure#Cell morphology|cell shape]], Gram staining is a rapid method used to differentiate bacterial species. Such staining, together with growth requirement and antibiotic susceptibility testing, and other macroscopic and physiologic tests, forms the full basis for classification and subdivision of the bacteria (e.g., see figure and pre-1990 versions of ''[[Bergey's Manual]]'').

[[File:Gram-Positive Classification.png|thumb|none|Species identification hierarchy in clinical settings|660px]]

[[Bacterial taxonomy#history|Historically]], the kingdom [[Monera]] was divided into four [[Taxonomic rank|divisions]] based primarily on Gram staining: [[Firmicutes]] (positive in staining), [[Gracilicutes]] (negative in staining), [[Mollicutes]] (neutral in staining) and Mendocutes (variable in staining).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=N.

Based on [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular studies]] of the 16S sequences, Woese recognised twelve [[bacterial phyla]]. Two of these were both gram-positive and were divided on the proportion of the [[guanine]] and [[cytosine]] content in their [[DNA]]. The high G + C phylum was made up of the [[Actinobacteria]]  and the low G + C phylum contained the [[Firmicutes]].<ref name="woese87"/> The Actinobacteria include the ''[[Corynebacterium]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium]]'', ''[[Nocardia]]'' and ''[[Streptomyces]]'' genera. The (low G + C) Firmicutes, have a 45–60% GC content, but this is lower than that of the Actinobacteria.<ref name=Brock />

Although bacteria are traditionally divided into two main groups, gram-positive and gram-negative, based on their Gram stain retention property, this classification system is ambiguous as it refers to three distinct aspects (staining result, envelope organization, taxonomic group), which do not necessarily coalesce for some bacterial species.<ref name="Guptab">{{cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = R.S. | year = 1998 | title = Protein phylogenies and signature sequences: A reappraisal of evolutionary relationships among archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes | url = | journal = Microbiol.

All gram-positive bacteria are bounded by a single-unit lipid membrane, and, in general, they contain a thick layer (20–80&nbsp;nm) of peptidoglycan responsible for retaining the Gram stain. A number of other bacteria—that are bounded by a single membrane, but stain Gram-negative due to either lack of the peptidoglycan layer, as in the [[Mycoplasma]]s, or their inability to retain the Gram stain because of their cell wall composition—also show close relationship to the Gram-positive bacteria. For the bacterial cells bounded by a single cell membrane, the term "monoderm bacteria" or "monoderm prokaryotes" has been proposed.<ref name="Guptab"/><ref name="Guptaa"/>

In contrast to gram-positive bacteria, all archetypical gram-negative bacteria are bounded by a cytoplasmic membrane and an outer cell membrane; they contain only a thin layer of peptidoglycan (2–3&nbsp;nm) between these membranes. The presence of inner and outer cell membranes defines a new compartment in these cells: the [[periplasmic space]] or the periplasmic compartment. These bacteria have been designated as "diderm bacteria."<ref name="Guptab"/><ref name="Guptaa"/> The distinction between the monoderm and diderm bacteria is supported by conserved signature indels in a number of important proteins (viz.

=== Exceptions ===

In general, gram-positive bacteria are monoderms and have a single [[lipid bilayer]] whereas gram-negative bacteria are diderms and have two bilayers. Some taxa lack peptidoglycan (such as the domain [[Archaea]], the class [[Mollicutes]], some members of the [[Rickettsiales]], and the insect-endosymbionts of the [[Enterobacteriales]]) and are gram-variable. This, however, does not always hold true. The ''[[Deinococcus-Thermus]]'' bacteria have gram-positive stains, although they are structurally similar to gram-negative bacteria with two layers. The [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] have a single layer, yet (with some exceptions<ref>{{Cite journal

Some Firmicute species are not gram-positive. These belong to the class [[Mollicutes]] (alternatively considered a class of the phylum [[Tenericutes]]), which lack peptidoglycan (gram-indeterminate), and the class Negativicutes, which includes [[Selenomonas]] and stain gram-negative.<ref name="pmid19667386"/> Additionally, a number of bacterial taxa (viz. [[Negativicutes]], [[Fusobacteria]], [[Synergistetes]], and [[Elusimicrobia]]) that are either part of the phylum Firmicutes or branch in its proximity are found to possess a diderm cell structure.<ref name="Sutcliffe, 2010"/><ref name="Guptac"/><ref name="pmid19667386"/> However, a conserved signature indel (CSI) in the [[HSP60]] ([[GroEL]]) protein distinguishes all traditional phyla of gram-negative bacteria (e.g., [[Proteobacteria]], [[Aquificae]], [[Chlamydiae]], [[Bacteroidetes]], [[Chlorobi]], [[Cyanobacteria]], [[Fibrobacteres]], [[Verrucomicrobia]], [[Planctomycetes]], [[Spirochetes]], [[Acidobacteria]], etc.) from these other atypical diderm bacteria, as well as other phyla of monoderm bacteria (e.g., Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, [[Thermotogae]], Chloroflexi, etc.).<ref name="Guptac"/> The presence of this CSI in all sequenced species of conventional LPS ([[lipopolysaccharide]])-containing gram-negative bacterial phyla provides evidence that these phyla of bacteria form a monophyletic clade and that no loss of the outer membrane from any species from this group has occurred.<ref name="Guptac"/>

== Pathogenesis ==

[[File:Actinomyces spp 01.jpg|thumb|320px|Colonies of a gram-positive pathogen of the oral cavity, ''[[Actinomyces]]'' sp.]]
In the classical sense, six gram-positive genera are typically pathogenic in humans. Two of these, ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', are [[Coccus|cocci]] (sphere-shaped). The remaining organisms are [[bacilli]] (rod-shaped) and can be subdivided based on their ability to form [[spore]]s. The non-spore formers are ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Listeria]]'' (a coccobacillus), whereas ''[[Bacillus]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' produce spores.<ref>{{cite book|title=Clinical Microbiology made ridiculously simple|last=Gladwin|first=Mark|author2=Bill Trattler|year=2007|publisher=MedMaster, Inc|location=Miami, FL|isbn=978-0-940780-81-1|pages=4–5}}</ref> The spore-forming bacteria can again be divided based on their [[Cellular respiration|respiration]]: ''Bacillus'' is a [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobe]], while ''Clostridium'' is an [[obligate anaerobe]].<ref>Sahebnasagh R, Saderi H, Owlia P.

==Bacterial transformation==
[[Transformation (genetics)|Transformation]] is one of three processes for [[horizontal gene transfer]], in which exogenous genetic material passes from a donor bacterium to a recipient bacterium, the other two processes being [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] (transfer of [[plasmid|genetic material]] between two bacterial cells in direct contact) and [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] (injection of donor bacterial DNA by a [[bacteriophage]] virus into a recipient host bacterium).<ref name=Johnston>{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnston C, Martin B, Fichant G, Polard P, Claverys JP |title=Bacterial transformation: distribution, shared mechanisms and divergent control |journal=Nat.

As of 2014 about 80 species of bacteria were known to be capable of transformation, about evenly divided between Gram-positive and [[Gram-negative bacteria]]; the number might be an overestimate since several of the reports are supported by single papers.<ref name=Johnston/>  Transformation among gram-positive bacteria has been studied in medically important species such as ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus sanguinis]]'' and in gram-positive soil bacterium ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''.<ref name=Michod>{{cite journal |vauthors=Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM |title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens |journal=Infect.
