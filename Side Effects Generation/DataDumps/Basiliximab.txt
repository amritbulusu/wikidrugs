'''Basiliximab''' (trade name '''Simulect''') is a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] mouse-human monoclonal [[antibody]] to the Î± chain ([[CD25]]) of the [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] [[IL-2 receptor|receptor]] of [[T cells]].  It is used to prevent [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] in [[organ transplant]]ation, especially in [[kidney]] transplants. It is a [[Novartis]] product and was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1998.

==Uses==
Basiliximab is an [[immunosuppressant]] agent used to prevent immediate [[transplant rejection]] in people who are receiving kidney transplants, in combination with other agents.<ref name=Medline>MedlinePlus. Last Revised - June 15, 2012 [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a612013.html Basiliximab Injection]</ref> It has been reported that some cases of [[lichen planus]] have been successfully treated with basiliximab as an alternative therapy to [[ciclosporin]]. No short-term side effects have been reported.<ref>A.D. Katsambas, T.M. Lotti European handbook of dermatological treatments 2nd edition, 2003, page 291, {{ISBN|3-540-00878-0}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==

Basiliximab competes with IL-2 to bind to the alpha chain subunit of the IL2 receptor on the surface of the activated T lymphocytes and thus prevents the receptor from signaling.  This prevents T cells from replicating and also from activating B cells, which are responsible for the production of [[antibodies]], which would bind to the transplanted organ and stimulate an immune response against the transplant.<ref name=HardingerRev>Hardinger KL, Brennan DC, Klein CL.

==Chemistry==
It is a chimeric CD25 monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 isotype.<ref name=HardingerRev/><ref name=label/>
