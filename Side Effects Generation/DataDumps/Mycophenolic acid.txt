'''Mycophenolic acid''', less accurately called '''mycophenolate''', is an [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressant]] drug used to prevent [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] in [[organ transplant]]ation. It inhibits an enzyme needed for the growth of [[T cells]] and [[B cells]]. It was initially marketed as the [[prodrug]] mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to improve oral [[bioavailability]]. More recently, the salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Mycophenolate mofetil is marketed under the trade name '''CellCept''' and mycophenolate sodium as '''Myfortic'''.

Discovered by an Italian medical scientist [[Bartolomeo Gosio]] in 1893, mycophenolic acid was the first antibiotic to be synthesised in pure and crystalline form. But its medical application was forgotten until two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black resynthesised it in 1912, and gave its chemical name. It was eventually found to be a broad-spectrum acting drug having antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis properties.<ref name=silverman>{{cite journal|last1=Silverman Kitchin|first1=Jennifer E.|last2=Pomeranz|first2=Miriam Keltz|last3=Pak|first3=Grace|last4=Washenik|first4=Ken|last5=Shupack|first5=Jerome L.|title=Rediscovering mycophenolic acid: A review of its mechanism, side effects, and potential uses|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|year=1997|volume=37|issue=3|pages=445–449|doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(97)70147-6}}</ref> The clinically usable drug Cellcept was developed by South African geneticist [[Anthony Clifford Allison|Anthony Allison]] and his wife Elsie M.

==Medical uses==
Mycophenolate is used for the prevention of [[organ transplant]] [[transplant rejection|rejection]]. Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection in adults and [[Kidney transplantation|renal transplant]] rejection in children over 2 years; whereas mycophenolate sodium is indicated for the prevention of renal transplant rejection in adults. Mycophenolate sodium has also been used for the prevention of rejection in [[Liver transplantation|liver]], [[Heart transplantation|heart]], and/or [[Lung transplantation|lung transplant]]s in children older than two years.<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor.

Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with [[thrombophlebitis]] and [[thrombosis]].

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has issued an alert that patients on mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including [[shingles]], other [[herpes]] infections, [[cytomegalovirus]], and [[BK virus]] associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 patients that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug.

Mycophenolate mofetil is the [[morpholine|morpholino]]{{zwnj}}ethyl ester of mycophenolic acid; the ester masks the [[carboxyl group]]. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to have a [[pKa]] values of 5.6 for the morpholino moiety and 8.5 for the phenolic group.<ref>http://www.rocheusa.com/products/cellcept/pi.pdf</ref>

==History==

Mycophenolic acid was discovered by Italian medical scientist [[Bartolomeo Gosio]]. Gosio collected a fungus from spoiled corn and named it ''Penicillium glaucum''. (The species is now called ''[[Penicillium brevicompactum|P. brevicompactum]]''.) In 1893 he found that the fungus had antibacterial activity. In 1896 he could isolate the crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the [[Bacillus anthracis|anthrax bacterium]].<ref name=silverman/> This was the first antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystalline form. But the discovery was forgotten.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zhang|first1=Lixin|last2=Demain|first2=Arnold L.|title=Natural Products: Drug Discovery and Therapeutic Medicine|year=2005|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=9781592599769|page=14|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iP0i7x_38ZwC&dq}}</ref> It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and gave the name mycophenolic acid.

Cellcept was developed by a South African geneticist [[Anthony Clifford Allison|Anthony Allison]] and his wife Elsie M. Eugui. In the 1970s while working at the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]], Allison investigated the biochemical causes of immunune deficiency in children. He discovered the metabolic pathway involving an enzyme, [[inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase]], which is responsible for undesirable immune response in [[autoimmune diseases]], as well as for [[immune rejection]] in [[organ transplantation]]. He conceived an idea that if a molecule that could block the enzyme is discovered, then, it would become an immunosuppressive drug that could be used for autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. In 1981 he decided to go for drug discovery and approached several pharmaceutical companies, which turned him down one by one as he had no primary knowledge on drug research. However, [[Syntex]] liked his plans and asked him to join the company with his wife.<ref name=watt>{{cite journal|last1=Watts|first1=Geoff|title=Anthony Clifford Allison|journal=The Lancet|year=2014|volume=383|issue=9925|page=1290|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60635-8}}</ref> He became Vice President for the research. In one of their experiments the Allisons used an antibacterial compound, mycophenolate mofetil, which was abandoned in clinical use due to its adverse effects.

Mycophenolate mofetil is beginning to be used in the management of auto-immune disorders such as [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP), [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), [[scleroderma]] (systemic sclerosis or SSc), and [[pemphigus vulgaris]] (PV) with success for some patients.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mimouni D, Anhalt GJ, Cummins DL, Kouba DJ, Thorne JE, Nousari HC |title=Treatment of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus with mycophenolate mofetil |journal=Archives of Dermatology |volume=139 |issue=6 |pages=739–42 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12810504 |doi=10.1001/archderm.139.6.739}}</ref>

It is also currently being used as a long-term therapy for maintaining remission of [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], though thus far, studies have found it inferior to azathioprine.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} A combination of mycophenolate and [[ribavirin]] has been found to stop infection by and [[viral replication|replication]] of [[dengue]] virus ''[[in vitro]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Diamond MS, Zachariah M, Harris E |title=Mycophenolic acid inhibits dengue virus infection by preventing replication of viral RNA |journal=Virology |volume=304 |issue=2 |pages=211–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12504563|doi=10.1006/viro.2002.1685}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Takhampunya R, Ubol S, Houng HS, Cameron CE, Padmanabhan R |title=Inhibition of dengue virus replication by mycophenolic acid and ribavirin |journal=The Journal of General Virology |volume=87 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1947–52 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16760396 |doi=10.1099/vir.0.81655-0}}</ref>
