'''Frovatriptan''' (trade name '''Frova''') is a [[triptan]] [[medication|drug]] developed by [[Vernalis plc|Vernalis]] for the treatment of [[migraine]] [[headache]]s and for short term prevention of menstrual migraine.  The product is licensed to [[Endo Pharmaceuticals]] in North America and [[Menarini]] in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frova |url=http://www.vernalis.com/ver/rdc2/pain/frovatriptan/ |publisher=Vernalis |accessdate=2007-11-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225521/http://www.vernalis.com/ver/rdc2/pain/frovatriptan/ |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Frovatriptan inhibits excessive dilation of arteries that supply blood to the head. It is available as 2.5&nbsp;mg tablets.

Frovatriptan has mean terminal elimination [[half-life]] of approximately 26 hours, which is substantially longer than other triptans.

==Mechanism of action==
Frovatriptan is a 5HT receptor agonist, with high affinity for the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors. It has no significant effects on the GABA<sub>A</sub> mediated channel activity and benzodiazepine binding sites.

==Adverse effects==
Serious but rare cardiac events have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. These include: coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.

==Contraindications==
Frovatriptan should not be given to patients with:
* Ischemic heart disease
* Cerebrovascular syndrome
* Peripheral vascular disease
* Uncontrolled hypertension
* Hemiplegic or basilar migraine

==US licensing==
Frovatriptan is available only by [[Medical prescription|prescription]] in the United States, and Canada where a secondary New Drug Approval (sNDA) was filed in July 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patient Information Sheet -- Frovatriptan succinate (marketed as Frova) |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/patient/frovatripanPIS.htm |date=July 2006 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=2007-11-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141557/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/patient/frovatripanPIS.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>
