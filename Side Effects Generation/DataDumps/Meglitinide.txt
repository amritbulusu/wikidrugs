'''Meglitinides''' ('''glinides''') make up a class of drugs used to treat [[diabetes type 2]].<ref name="pmid16735959">{{cite journal |author=Blicklé JF |title=Meglitinide analogues: a review of clinical data focused on recent trials |journal=Diabetes Metab. |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=113–20 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16735959 |doi= 10.1016/S1262-3636(07)70257-4|url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-DM-04-2006-32-2-1262-3636-101019-200517724}}</ref>

They bind to an [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic [[beta cell]]s in a similar manner to [[sulfonylurea]]s but have a weaker binding affinity and faster dissociation from the SUR1 binding site. This increases the concentration of intracellular  potassium, which causes the electric potential over the membrane to become more positive.  This [[depolarization]] opens voltage-gated [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup> channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of [[insulin]] granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of (pro) insulin.

== Drugs ==

The main branded drug in the meglitinide class is [[Novo Nordisk]]'s [[repaglinide]] (Prandin), which gained FDA approval in 1997.  Other drugs in this class include [[nateglinide]] (Starlix) and [[mitiglinide]] (Glufast).

== Side-effects ==
Side effects include weight gain and [[hypoglycemia]].  While the potential for hypoglycemia is less than for those on [[sulfonylurea]]s, it is still a serious potential side effect that can be life-threatening.  Patients on this medication should know the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and appropriate management.

Repaglinide (Prandin) caused an increased incidence in male rats of benign adenomas (tumors) of the thyroid and liver.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020741s038lbl.pdf Prandin (repaglinide) prescribing information], fda.gov</ref> No such effect was seen with another drug of this class, nateglinide (Starlix).<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/021204s011lbl.pdf Starlix (nateglinide) prescribing information], fda.gov</ref>
