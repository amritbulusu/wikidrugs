== History ==

The generic name cisatracurium was conceived by scientists at Burroughs Wellcome Co. (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) by combining the name "atracurium" with "cis" [hence ''cis''atracurium] because the molecule is one of the three ''cis''-''cis'' isomers comprising the ten isomers of the parent, [[atracurium]].<ref name = Stenlake1984 />  Atracurium itself was invented at Strathclyde University and licensed to [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]], [[Research Triangle Park, NC]], for further development and subsequent marketing as Tracrium. As the secondary pharmacology of atracurium was being developed, it became clear that the primary clinical disadvantage of atracurium was likely to be its propensity to elicit histamine release. To address this issue, a program was initiated to investigate the individual isomer constituents of atracurium to identify and isolate the isomer(s) associated with the undesirable histamine effects as well as identify the isomer that might possibly retain the desirable properties without the histamine release. Thus, in 1989, D A Hill and G L Turner, PhD (both chemists at Burroughs Wellcome Co., Dartford, UK) first synthesized cisatracurium as an individual isomer molecule. The pharmacological research of cisatracurium and the other individual isomers<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199607000-00023 | vauthors = Wastila WB, Maehr RB, Turner GL, Hill DA, Savarese JJ | title = Comparative pharmacology of cisatracurium (51W89), atracurium, and five isomers in cats | journal = Anesthesiol |date=Jul 1996 | volume = 85 | issue = 1  | pages = 169–177 | pmid = 8694363}}</ref> was then developed further primarily by R. Brandt Maehr and William B. Wastila, PhD (both of whom were pharmacologists within the Division of Pharmacology at Burroughs Wellcome Co.) in collaboration with John J. Savarese MD (who at the time was an anesthesiologist in the Dept. of Anesthesia, [[Harvard Medical School]] at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Boston]], MA). Thereafter, the entire clinical development of [[cisatracurium]] was completed in a record short period from 1992 to 1994: the team of scientists was led by J. Neal Weakly PhD, Martha M. Abou-Donia PhD, and Steve Quessy PhD, in the Division of Clinical Neurosciences at [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]], [[Research Triangle Park]], NC.  By the time of its approval for human use, in 1995, by the US Food and Drug Administration, [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]] had merged with [[Glaxo Inc.]], and cisatracurium was approved to be marketed as Nimbex by [[GlaxoWellcome Inc.]] The trade name "Nimbex" was derived from inserting an "i" to the original proposal "Nmb''ex''," which stood for '''ex'''cellent '''N'''euro'''m'''uscular '''b'''locker.

== Preclinical pharmacology ==

''In vitro'' studies using human plasma indicated that cisatracurium spontaneously degrades at physiological pH via [[Hofmann elimination]] to yield [[laudanosine]] and the quaternary monoacrylate. Subsequent ester hydrolysis of the monoacrylate generates the monoquaternary alcohol, although the rate-limiting step is [[Hofmann elimination]].<ref name= Dear1995 /> In rat plasma, cisatracurium is also metabolized by non-specific carboxylesterases (a rate-limiting step) to the monoquaternary alcohol and the monoquaternary acid.<ref name= Dear1995 />

== Clinical pharmacology ==

As is evident with the parent molecule, atracurium,<ref name= Stiller1985>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/bja/57.11.1085 | vauthors = Stiller RL, Cook DR, Chakravorti S | title = In vitro degradation of atracurium in human plasma | journal = Br J Anaesth | year = 1985 | volume = 57 | issue = 11 | pages = 1085–1088 | pmid = 3840382}}</ref><ref name = Nigrovic1991>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199103000-00010 | vauthors = Nigrovic V, Fox JL | title = Atracurium decay and the formation of laudanosine in humans | journal = Anesthesiol | year = 1991 | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 446–454 | pmid = 2001023}}</ref> cisatracurium is also susceptible to degradation by Hofmann elimination and [[ester]] [[hydrolysis]] as components of the ''in vivo'' metabolic processes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} See the [[atracurium]] page for information on Hofmann elimination in vivo versus the Hofmann degradation chemical reaction.

Because Hofmann elimination is a temperature- and [[blood plasma|plasma]] pH-dependent process, cisatracurium's rate of degradation ''in vivo'' is highly influenced by body pH and temperature just as it is with the parent molecule, atracurium: thus, an increase in body pH favors the elimination process,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} whereas a decrease in temperature slows down the process.

One of the [[metabolites]] of cistracurium via Hofmann elimination is laudanosine – see the [[atracurium]] page for further discussion of the issue regarding this metabolite.  80% of cisatracurium is metabolized eventually to [[laudanosine]] and 20% is metabolized hepatically or excreted renally.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} 10-15% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

'''Since Hofmann elimination is an organ-independent chemodegradative mechanism, there is little or no risk to the use of cisatracurium in patients with liver or renal disease when compared with other neuromuscular-blocking agents'''
'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katzung|first=Bertram G.|title=Basic and clinical pharmacology.|year=2011|publisher=Mcgraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-176401-8|edition=12th}}</ref>

The two reverse ester linkages in the bridge between the two isoquinolinium groups make atracurium and cisatracurium poor targets for [[plasma cholinesterase]], unlike mivacurium which has two conventional ester linkages.

== Adverse effects ==

=== Histamine release – hypotension, reflex tachycardia and cutaneous flush ===

Unlike the parent, atracurium, cisatracurium affords a much better pharmacological profile with respect to eliciting histamine release.

=== Bronchospasm – Pulmonary compliance ===

To date, cisatracurium has not been reported to elicit bronchospasm at doses that are clinically prescribed.

=== Laudanosine – Epileptic foci ===

Cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination as a primary route of chemodegradation: consequently one of the metabolites from this process is [[laudanosine]], a tertiary amino alkaloid reported to be a modest CNS stimulant with epileptogenic activity<ref name = Standaert>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000542-198512000-00002 | author = Standaert FG | title = Magic bullets, science, and medicine | journal = Anesthesiol | volume = 63 | pages = 577–578 |date=Dec 1985 | pmid = 2932980 | issue = 6}}</ref> and cardiovascular effects such as [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and a [[bradycardia|slowed heart rate]].<ref name = Fodale>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fodale V, Santamaria LB | title = Laudanosine, an atracurium and cisatracurium metabolite | journal = Eur J Anaesthesiol | volume = 19| pages = 466–473 |date=Jul 2002| pmid = 12113608 | issue = 7 | doi=10.1017/s0265021502000777}}</ref> As a tertiary amine, Laudanosine is unionised and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. Presently, there is little evidence that laudanosine accumulation and related toxicity will likely ever be seen with the doses of cisatracurium that are administered in clinical practice especially given that the plasma concentrations of laudanosine generated are lower with cisatracurium than those seen with atracurium.<ref name = Fodale />

== Research ==

A recent study showed that cisatracurium pretreatment effectively decreases the incidence and severity of pain induced by [[propofol]] general anaesthesia.
