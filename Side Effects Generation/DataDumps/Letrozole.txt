'''Letrozole''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade name '''Femara''') is an [[oral administration|orally active]] [[nonsteroidal]] [[aromatase inhibitor]] for the treatment of hormonally-responsive [[breast cancer]] after surgery.

==Uses==

===FDA-approved use===
[[File:000549lg Femara.jpg|thumb|right|Femara 2.5 mg oral tablet]]
Letrozole is approved by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of local or metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive or has an unknown receptor status in postmenopausal women.<ref name="FDA">Drugs.com: {{drugs.com|monograph|letrozole}} for letrozole.  It is also used for ovarian cancer patients after they have completed chemotherapy.</ref>

===Off-label uses===
Letrozole has been used for [[Ovulation induction|ovarian stimulation]] by fertility doctors since 2001 because it has fewer side-effects than [[clomiphene]] (''Clomid'') and less chance of multiple gestation. A study of 150 babies following treatment with letrozole or letrozole and gonadotropins presented at the [[American Society of Reproductive Medicine]] 2005 Conference found no difference in overall abnormalities but did find a significantly higher rate of locomotor and cardiac abnormalities among the group having taken letrozole compared to natural conception.<ref name="biljan2005">{{cite journal | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.07.230 | title=The Outcome of 150 Babies Following the Treatment With Letrozole or Letrozole and Gonadotropins | vauthors=Biljan MM, Hemmings R, Brassard N | year=2005 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.07.230 | volume=84 | journal=Fertility and Sterility | page=S95}}</ref> A larger, follow-up study with 911 babies compared those born following treatment with letrozole to those born following treatment with clomiphene.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16650422 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.03.014 | volume=85 | issue=6 |date=June 2006 | pages=1761–5  |vauthors=Tulandi T, Martin J, Al-Fadhli R, etal | title = Congenital malformations among 911 newborns conceived after infertility treatment with letrozole or clomiphene citrate | journal = Fertility and Sterility}}</ref> That study also found no significant difference in the rate of overall abnormalities, but found that congenital cardiac anomalies was significantly higher in the clomiphene group compared to the letrozole group.

The anti-estrogen action of letrozole has been shown to be useful in pretreatment for termination of pregnancy, in combination with [[misoprostol]]. It can be used in place of [[mifepristone]], which is expensive and unavailable in many countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vivian Chi Yan Lee |author2=Ernest Hung Yu Ng |author3=William Shu Biu Yeung |author4=Pak Chung Ho | title = Misoprostol With or Without Letrozole Pretreatment for Termination of Pregnancy | journal = Ob Gyn. | volume = 117 | issue = 2, Part 1 | year = 2011 | pages = 317–323 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182073fbf}}</ref>

Letrozole is sometimes used as a treatment for [[gynecomastia]], although it is probably most effective at this if caught in an early stage (such as in users of [[anabolic steroid]]s).<ref>{{Cite journal

Letrozole has also been used to treat [[endometriosis]].<ref>[http://www.endometriosis.org/ESHRE2005-abbamonte.html Endometriosis ESHRE abstract<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
[[Estrogen]]s are produced by the conversion of [[androgens]] through the activity of the [[aromatase]] enzyme. Estrogens then bind to an estrogen receptor, which causes cells to divide.

Letrozole is an [[aromatase inhibitor]].

Letrozole prevents the aromatase from producing estrogens by competitive, reversible binding to the heme of its [[cytochrome P450]] unit. The action is specific, and letrozole does not reduce production of mineralo- or corticosteroids.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Contraindications==
Letrozole is contraindicated in women having a pre-[[menopausal]] hormonal status, during pregnancy and lactation.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects are sweating, [[hot flash]]es, [[arthralgia]] (joint pain), and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

Generally, side effects include signs and symptoms of [[hypoestrogenism]]. There is concern that long term use may lead to [[osteoporosis]],<ref name="FDA" /> which is in certain patient populations such as post-menopausal women or osteoporotics, [[bisphosphonate]]s may also be prescribed.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Interactions==
Letrozole inhibits the liver enzyme [[CYP2A6]], and to a lesser extent [[CYP2C19]], ''[[in vitro]]'', but no relevant interactions with drugs like [[cimetidine]] and [[warfarin]] have been observed.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Comparison with tamoxifen==
[[Tamoxifen]] is also used to treat hormonally-responsive breast cancer, but it does so by interfering with the estrogen receptor. However, letrozole is effective only in post-menopausal women, in whom estrogen is produced predominantly in peripheral tissues (i.e. in adipose tissue, like that of the breast) and a number of sites in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simpson ER |title=Sources of estrogen and their importance |journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=86 |issue=3–5 |pages=225–30 |year=2003 |pmid=14623515 |doi=10.1016/S0960-0760(03)00360-1}}</ref> In pre-menopausal women, the main source of estrogen is from the ovaries not the peripheral tissues, and letrozole is ineffective.

In the BIG 1–98 Study, of post-menopausal women with hormonally-responsive breast cancer, letrozole reduced the recurrence of cancer, but did not change survival rate, compared to tamoxifen.<ref>Letrozole therapy alone or in sequence with tamoxifen in women with breast cancer, the BIG 1–98 Collaborative Group, N Engl J Med, 361:766, 2009 Aug 20</ref><ref>[http://www.sabcs.org/EnduringMaterials/Index.asp 32nd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516171511/http://www.sabcs.org/EnduringMaterials/Index.asp |date=2010-05-16 }}</ref>
