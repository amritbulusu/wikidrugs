'''Cilostazol''' is a quinolinone-derivative [[medication]] used in the alleviation of the [[symptom]]s of [[intermittent claudication]] in individuals with [[peripheral vascular disease]].  It is manufactured by [[Otsuka Pharmaceutical|Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.]] under the [[trade name]] '''Pletal'''.

Although drugs similar to cilostazol have increased the risk of death in patients with [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]], studies of significant size have not addressed people without the disease.

Cilostazol is a [[phosphodiesterase inhibitor]] with therapeutic focus on [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP).  It inhibits platelet aggregation and is a direct arterial vasodilator.  Its main effects are dilation of the [[artery|arteries]] supplying blood to the legs and decreasing [[platelet]] [[coagulation]].

==Mechanism==
Cilostazol is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 3 ([[Phosphodiesterase 3|PDE<sub>3</sub>]]) with therapeutic focus on increasing cAMP. An increase in cAMP results in an increase in the active form of [[protein kinase A]] (PKA), which is directly related with an inhibition in platelet aggregation. PKA also prevents the activation of an enzyme (myosin light-chain kinase) that is important in the contraction of smooth muscle cells, thereby exerting its vasodilatory effect.

==Clinical use==
Cilostazol is approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication.  The typical dose is 100&nbsp;[[Kilogram#SI_multiples|mg]] twice a day.  The effects may take as long as 3 months to be evident and has been shown to improve pain-free walking distance by 50%.

Cilostazol is also frequently used off-label, at the same dose, for treatment of intracranial atherosclerosis and secondary stroke prevention.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kwon | first1 = SU | last2 = Cho | first2 = YJ | last3 = Koo | first3 = JS | last4 = Bae | first4 = HJ | last5 = Lee | first5 = YS | last6 = Hong | first6 = KS | last7 = Lee | first7 = JH | last8 = Kim | first8 = JS | title = Cilostazol Prevents the Progression of the Symptomatic Intracranial Arterial Stenosis: The Multicenter Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial of Cilostazol in Symptomatic Intracranial Arterial Stenosis | journal = Stroke | date = 3 March 2005 | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 782–6 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.0000157667.06542.b7 | pmid = 15746463 | url = http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/strokeaha/36/4/782.full.pdf | accessdate = 27 December 2016}}</ref>

===In people with heart failure===
Cilostazol is dangerous for people with severe heart failure. Cilostazol has been studied in people without heart failure, without evidence of harm, but much more data would be needed to determine no risk exists. Although cilostazol would not be approvable for a trivial condition the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee and FDA concluded that fully informed patients and physicians should be able to choose to use it to treat intermittent claudication. Patient and physician labeling will describe the basis for concern and the incomplete information available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/news/cilostazol/approval.htm |date=August 11, 1999 |accessdate=2007-04-30 |author=[[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] |title=Approval of Cilostazol |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427021345/http://www.fda.gov/cder/news/cilostazol/approval.htm |archivedate=2007-04-27 |df= }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Possible side effects of cilostazol use include [[headache]] (the most common), [[diarrhea]], severe [[heat intolerance]], abnormal [[human feces|stool]]s, [[tachycardia|increased heart rate]], and [[palpitations]].<ref name=FDA_PI/>

==Interactions==
Cilostazol is metabolized by [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2C19]], two [[isoenzyme]]s of the [[cytochrome P450]] system. Drugs that [[enzyme induction and inhibition|inhibit]] CYP3A4, such as [[itraconazole]], [[erythromycin]], [[ketoconazole]], and [[diltiazem]], are known to [[drug interaction|interact]] with cilostazol. The [[proton pump inhibitor]] [[omeprazole]], a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19, increases exposure to the active [[metabolite]] of cilostazol.<ref name=FDA_PI/>
