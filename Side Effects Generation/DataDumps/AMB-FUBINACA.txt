'''AMB-FUBINACA''' (also known as '''FUB-AMB''' and '''MMB-FUBINACA''') is an [[indazole]]-based [[synthetic cannabinoid]] that is a potent [[agonist]] of the [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB<sub>1</sub> receptor]] and has been sold online as a [[designer drug]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.caymanchem.com/app/template/Product.vm/catalog/9001960 | title=FUB-AMB | publisher=Cayman Chemical | accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jms.3722/abstract | title=Fragmentation of synthetic cannabinoids with an isopropyl group or a tert-butyl group ionized by electron impact and electrospray | author1=Shigeki Akamatsu | author2=Masashi Yoshida | journal=Journal of Mass Spectrometry | date=January 2016 | volume=51 | issue=1 | pages=28–32 | doi=10.1002/jms.3722}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author1=Samuel D Banister et al. | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acschemneuro.5b00112 | title=The pharmacology of valinate and tert-leucinate synthetic cannabinoids 5F-AMBICA, 5F-AMB, 5F-ADB, AMB-FUBINACA, MDMB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA, and their analogues | date=July 2016 | journal=ACS Chemical Neuroscience | doi=10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00137 | pmid=27421060 | volume=7 | pages=1241–54}}</ref>  It was originally developed by Pfizer which described the compound in a patent in 2009, but was later abandoned and never tested on humans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/nyregion/zombielike-state-was-caused-by-synthetic-marijuana.html|title=Drug 85 Times as Potent as Marijuana Caused a ‘Zombielike’ State in Brooklyn|last=Santora|first=Marc|date=2016-12-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>

Screening for the more usual drugs of abuse was negative in all 8 patients. AMB-FUBINACA itself was found in a sample from the product smoked by another patient. The metabolite was identified after 10 days and the AMB-FUBINACA was only confirmed 17 days after the incident.<ref name=NEJM/> 

Up to 20 deaths in New Zealand have also been attributed to AMB-FUBINACA during 2017, with tested products containing between 32mg/g and 400mg/g of the active ingredient, between 2x to 25x stronger than the product involved in the mass casualty event in New York a year earlier.<ref>[https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2017/09/killer-chemicals/index.html Killer chemicals, Part 1.

== Legal status ==

The state of Louisiana banned AMB-FUBINACA through an emergency rule after it was detected in a [[synthetic cannabis]] product called "Train Wreck 2" which had been linked to adverse events and seizures on 3 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dhh.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/3059 | title=DHH Adds Two New Synthetic Marijuana Compounds to Banned List | publisher=Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals | date=3 June 2014 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref>  

Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying AMB-FUBINACA as a hazardous substance on November 10, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2014/november/cannabinoider-foreslas-bli-klassade-som-halsofarlig-vara/ | title=Cannabinoider föreslås bli klassade som hälsofarlig vara | publisher=Folkhälsomyndigheten | language=Swedish| accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref>
