'''Calcitonin''' (also known as '''thyrocalcitonin''') is a 32-amino acid linear polypeptide [[hormone]] that is produced
in [[human]]s primarily by the [[Parafollicular cell|parafollicular]] cells (also known as C-cells) of the [[thyroid]], and in many other animals in the [[ultimopharyngeal body]].<ref name="Costoff_Calcitonin_Structure">{{cite web | url = http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch6/s5ch6_21.htm | title=Sect. 5, Ch. 6: Anatomy, Structure, and Synthesis of Calcitonin (CT) |author=Costoff A |date= |work=Endocrinology: hormonal control of calcium and phosphate |publisher=Medical College of Georgia |pages= |language= |quote= |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905133730/http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch6/s5ch6_21.htm |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}</ref> It acts to reduce blood [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), opposing the effects of [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH).<ref name="isbn1-4160-2328-3">{{cite book | vauthors = Boron WF, Boulpaep EL | others = | title = Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach | edition = | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = | year = 2004 | origyear = | pages = | chapter = Endocrine system chapter | quote = | isbn = 1-4160-2328-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

Calcitonin has been found in [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s. Its importance in humans has not been as well established as its importance in other animals, as its function is usually not significant in the regulation of normal calcium homeostasis.<ref name="Costoff_Calcitonin_Biological_Actions">{{cite web | url = http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch6/s5ch6_23.htm | title=Sect. 5, Ch. 6: Biological Actions of CT |author=Costoff A |date= |work= |publisher=Medical College of Georgia |pages= |language= |quote= |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705203238/http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch6/s5ch6_23.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> It belongs to the [[calcitonin-like protein family]].

==Biosynthesis and regulation==
Calcitonin is formed by the [[proteolytic]] cleavage of a larger [[prepropeptide]], which is the product of the CALC1 gene ({{Gene|CALCA}}). The CALC1 gene belongs to a superfamily of related protein hormone precursors including [[islet amyloid precursor protein]], [[calcitonin gene-related peptide]], and the precursor of [[adrenomedullin]].

Secretion of calcitonin is stimulated by:

==Effects==

The hormone participates in [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and [[phosphorus]] [[metabolism]]. In many ways, calcitonin counteracts [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH).

More specifically, calcitonin lowers blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in two ways:
:* Major effect: Inhibits [[osteoclast]] activity in [[bone]]s<ref name="Costoff_Calcitonin_Bone">{{cite web | url = http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch6/s5ch6_24.htm |title=Sect. 5, Ch. 6: Effects of CT on Bone | vauthors = Costoff A | publisher=Medical College of Georgia |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622221510/http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch6/s5ch6_24.htm |archivedate=June 22, 2008 }}</ref>
:* Minor effect: Inhibits [[nephron|renal tubular cell]] reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate, allowing them to be excreted in the [[urine]]<ref name="Harrison Chapter">{{cite book |url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=331&sectionid=40727159 |last1=Potts |first1=John |last2=Jüppner |first2=Harald |name-list-format=vanc |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |chapter=Chapter 353.

High concentrations of calcitonin may be able to increase urinary excretion of  calcium and phosphate, via actions on the [[kidney]] tubules.<ref name="pmid9058369">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carney SL | title = Calcitonin and human renal calcium and electrolyte transport | journal = Mineral and Electrolyte Metabolism | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9058369 }}</ref> However, this is a minor effect with no physiological significance in humans. It is also a short-lived effect because the kidneys become resistant to calcitonin, as demonstrated by the kidney's unaffected excretion of calcium in patients with thyroid tumors that secrete excessive calcitonin.<ref name="Goodman_2009">{{cite book | title = Basic Medical Endocrinology | edition = Fourth  | last = Goodman | first = H.

In its skeleton-preserving actions, calcitonin protects against calcium loss from skeleton during periods of calcium mobilization, such as [[pregnancy]] and, especially, [[lactation]]. The protective mechanisms include the direct inhibition of bone resorption and the indirect effect through the inhibition of the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. The reason provided is that prolactin induces the release of PTH related peptide which enhances bone resorption, but is still under investigation., <ref name="Horwitz MJ1, Tedesco MB, Sereika SM, Syed MA, Garcia-Ocaña A, Bisello A, Hollis BW, Rosen CJ, Wysolmerski JJ, Dann P, Gundberg C, Stewart AF">{{cite journal|title=Continuous PTH and PTHrP infusion causes suppression of bone formation and discordant effects on 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D.|journal=J Bone Miner Res.|date=2005 Oct;20|pages=1792–803|pmid=16160737}}</ref><ref name="Rachel A Davey, Andrew G Turner, Julie F McManus, WS Maria Chiu, Francisca Tjahyono, Alison J Moore, Gerald J Atkins, Paul H Anderson, Cathy Ma, Vaida Glatt, Helen E MacLean, Cristina Vincent, Mary Bouxsein, Howard A Morris, David M Findlay, Jeffrey D Zajac">{{cite journal|title=Calcitonin Receptor Plays a Physiological Role to Protect Against Hypercalcemia in Mice|journal=JBMR|date=17 March 2008|volume=23|pages=1182–1193|doi=10.1359/jbmr.080310}}</ref><ref name="Janine P.

Other effects are in preventing postprandial [[hypercalcemia]] resulting from absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Also, calcitonin inhibits food intake in rats and monkeys, and may have [[Central nervous system|CNS]] action involving the regulation of feeding and appetite.

Calcitonin lowers blood calcium and phosphorus mainly through its inhibition of osteoclasts. Osteoblasts do not have calcitonin receptors and are therefore not directly affected by calcitonin levels. However, since bone resorption and bone formation are coupled processes, eventually calcitonin's inhibition of osteoclastic activity leads to decreased osteoblastic activity (as an indirect effect).<ref name="Goodman_2009" />

== Medical Significance ==
A malignancy of the parafollicular cells, i.e. Medullary thyroid cancer, typically produces an elevated serum calcitonin level.

==Pharmacology==
Salmon calcitonin is used for the treatment of:
* Postmenopausal [[osteoporosis]]
* [[Hypercalcaemia]]
* [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]]
* [[Bone metastases]]
* [[Phantom limb pain]]<ref name="pmid10332543">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wall GC, Heyneman CA | title = Calcitonin in phantom limb pain | journal = The Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 499–501 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10332543 | doi = 10.1345/aph.18204 }}</ref>

===General characteristics of the active substance===
Salmon calcitonin is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. Peak plasma concentrations are attained within the first hour of administration.

Animal studies have shown that calcitonin is primarily metabolised via proteolysis in the kidney following parenteral administration. The metabolites lack the specific biological activity of calcitonin. Bioavailability following subcutaneous and intramuscular injection in humans is high and similar for the two routes of administration (71% and 66%, respectively).

Calcitonin has short absorption and elimination half-lives of 10–15 minutes and 50–80 minutes, respectively. Salmon calcitonin is primarily and almost exclusively degraded in the kidneys, forming pharmacologically inactive fragments of the molecule. Therefore, the metabolic clearance is much lower in patients with end-stage renal failure than in healthy subjects. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is not known.  Plasma protein binding is 30% to 40%.

===Characteristics in patients===
There is a relationship between the subcutaneous dose of calcitonin and peak plasma concentrations. Following parenteral administration of 100 IU calcitonin, peak plasma concentration lies between about 200 and 400 pg/ml. Higher blood levels may be associated with increased incidence of nausea, vomiting, and secretory diarrhea.

===Preclinical safety data===
Conventional long-term toxicity, reproduction, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity studies have been performed in laboratory animals. Salmon calcitonin is devoid of embryotoxic, teratogenic, and mutagenic potential.

An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas has been reported in rats given synthetic salmon calcitonin for 1 year. This is considered a species-specific effect and of no clinical relevance.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Referrals_document/Calcitonin_31/WC500013882.pdf | title = Injectable Salmon Calcitonin }}</ref> Salmon calcitonin does not cross the placental barrier.

In lactating animals given calcitonin, suppression of milk production has been observed. Calcitonin is secreted into the milk.

==Pharmaceutical manufacture==
Calcitonin was extracted from the ultimobranchial glands (thyroid-like glands) of fish, particularly salmon.  Salmon calcitonin resembles human calcitonin, but is more active.  At present, it is produced either by [[recombinant DNA]] technology or by chemical [[peptide synthesis]].  The pharmacological properties of the synthetic and recombinant peptides have been demonstrated to be qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent.<ref name="UKEMC"/>

==Uses of calcitonin==

===Treatments===
[[File:Calcitonin Bones.png|thumb|Calcitonin affecting the spine.]]

Calcitonin can be used therapeutically for the treatment of [[hypercalcemia]] or [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="pmid15301040">{{cite journal | vauthors = Inzerillo AM, Zaidi M, Huang CL | title = Calcitonin: physiological actions and clinical applications | journal = Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism : JPEM | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 931–40 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15301040 | doi = 10.1007/s00198-015-3149-3 }}</ref>
In a recent clinical study, subcutaneous injections of calcitonin have reduced the incidence of fractures and reduced the decrease in bone mass in women with type 2 diabetes complicated with osteoporosis.<ref name="Liu Dexue and Zheng Yeuyeu">{{cite journal|title=Salmon calcitonin in the treatment of elderly women with type 2 diabetes complicated with osteoporosis|journal=Pak J Pharm Sci.|date=2014 Nov|volume=27|pages=2079–81|pmid=25410076|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Salmon+calcitonin+liu+dexue}}</ref>

Subcutaneous injections of calcitonin in patients suffering from [[mania]] resulted in significant decreases in irritability, euphoria and hyperactivity and hence calcitonin holds promise for treating [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name="pmid9549251">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vik A, Yatham LN | title = Calcitonin and bipolar disorder: a hypothesis revisited | journal = Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–17 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9549251 | pmc = 1188909 | doi =  }}</ref>  However no further work on this potential application of calcitonin has been reported.

===Diagnostics===

It may be used diagnostically as a [[tumor marker]] for [[medullary thyroid cancer]], in which high calcitonin levels may be present and elevated levels after surgery may indicate recurrence. It may even be used on [[biopsy]] samples from suspicious lesions (e.g., [[lymph node]]s that are [[Swelling (medical)|swollen]]) to establish whether they are [[metastases]] of the original cancer.

[[cutoff (reference value)|Cutoffs]] for calcitonin to distinguish cases with medullary thyroid cancer have been suggested to be as follows, with a higher value increasing the suspicion of medullary thyroid cancer:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Basuyau JP, Mallet E, Leroy M, Brunelle P | title = Reference intervals for serum calcitonin in men, women, and children | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 10 | pages = 1828–30 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15388660 | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2003.026963 }}</ref>

*children between 6 months and 3 years of age: 15&nbsp;ng/L or pg/mL
When over 3 years of age, adult cutoffs may be used

Increased levels of calcitonin have also been reported for various other conditions. They include: C-cell hyperplasia, Nonthyroidal oat cell carcinoma, Nonthyroidal small cell carcinoma and other nonthyroidal malignancies, acute and chronic renal failure, hypercalcemia, hypergastrinemia and other gastrointestinal disorders, and pulmonary disease.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors=Burtis CA, Ashwood ER, Bruns DE | title=Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics | edition=5th| publisher=Elsevier Saunders| pages=1774 | isbn=978-1-4160-6164-9}}</ref>
