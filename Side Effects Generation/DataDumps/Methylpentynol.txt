'''Methylpentynol''' ('''Methylparafynol''', '''Dormison''', '''Atemorin''', '''Oblivon''') is a [[Alcohol#tertiary|tertiary]] [[hexanol]] with [[hypnotic]]/[[sedative]] and [[anticonvulsant]] effects and an exceptionally low [[therapeutic index]]. It was discovered by Bayer in 1913<ref>{{ cite patent | country = DE | status = patent | number = 289800 | gdate = 1913-11-30 | assign1 = Bayer, Leverkusen | title = Verfahren zur Darstellung der Oxyalkylderivate von Kohlenwasserstoffen }}</ref> and was used shortly thereafter for the treatment of [[insomnia]], but its use was quickly phased out in response to newer drugs with far more favorable safety profiles.<ref>{{Cite journal

The drug was marketed again in the United States, Europe and elsewhere from 1956 well into the 1960s as a rapid-acting sedative; it was overshadowed at that point by [[benzodiazepines]] and the continued popularity of non-barbiturate sedatives such as [[meprobamate]]. <ref>Richard Devenport Hines, The Pursuit of Oblivion (2002) pp 327</ref> As of 2017, Methylpentynol has no accepted medical uses in any developed ([[first world]] country).
==Synthesis==
Methylpentynol is prepared by reaction of [[butanone]] with sodium [[acetylide]].
