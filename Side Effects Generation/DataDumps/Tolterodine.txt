'''Tolterodine''' (trade names '''Detrol''', '''Detrusitol''') is an [[antimuscarinic]] drug that is used for symptomatic treatment of [[urinary incontinence]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Tolterodine once-daily: superior efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of the overactive bladder1 |author1=Philip Van Kerrebroeck |author2=Karl Kreder |author3=Udo Jonas |author4=Norm Zinner |author5=Alan Wein |journal=Urology |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=414–421 |year=2001 |url=http://www.goldjournal.net/article/S0090-4295%2800%2901113-4/abstract |doi=10.1016/s0090-4295(00)01113-4}}</ref>

It is marketed by [[Pfizer]] in Canada and the United States by its brand name Detrol. In Egypt it is also found under the trade names Tolterodine by Sabaa and Incont L.A. by Adwia.

==Use==
Detrusor overactivity (DO, contraction of the muscular bladder wall) is the most common form of urinary incontinence (UI) in older adults. It is characterized by uninhibited bladder contractions causing an uncontrollable urge to void. Urinary frequency, urge incontinence and nocturnal incontinence occur.  Abnormal bladder contractions that coincide with the urge to void can be measured by [[Urodynamic testing|urodynamic studies]].  Treatment is bladder retraining,<ref>Bladder retraining [http://www.ichelp.org/page.aspx?pid=368#how ichelp.org] ''Interstitial Cystitis Association'' Accessed July 13, 2012</ref> [[Interstitial cystitis#Pelvic floor treatments|pelvic floor therapy]] or with drugs that inhibit bladder contractions such as [[oxybutinin]] and tolterodine.

== Pharmacology ==
Tolterodine acts on M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub><ref>[http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01036] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126071857/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01036 |date=November 26, 2012 }}</ref> subtypes of [[muscarinic receptor]]s whereas older [[antimuscarinic]] treatments for overactive bladder act more specifically on M<sub>3</sub> receptors.

Tolterodine, although it acts on all types of receptors, has fewer side effects than [[oxybutynin]] (M<sub>3</sub> and M<sub>1</sub> selective, but more so in the parotid than in the bladder) as tolterodine targets the bladder more than other areas of the body. This means that less drug needs to be given daily (due to efficient targeting of the bladder) and so there are fewer side effects.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Side effects of tolterodine ==
Known side effects:
* [[Xerostomia]] (dry mouth)
* [[Dyspepsia|Decreased gastric motility]] (upset stomach)
* [[Headache]]
* [[Constipation]]
* [[Dry eyes]]
* [[Sleepiness]]
* [[Urinary retention]]

The following reactions have been reported in patients who have taken tolterodine since it has become available:
* [[Allergic reactions]] including swelling
* [[Rapid heartbeat]] or [[Arrhythmia|abnormal heartbeat]]
* [[Edema|Accumulation of fluid]] in the arms and legs
* [[Hallucinations]]

Contraindications:

Not to be used in patients with [[myasthenia gravis]] and [[angle closure glaucoma]].
