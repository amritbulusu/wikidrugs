'''Triclosan''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''TCS'''), similar in its uses and mechanism of action to [[triclocarban]], is an [[antibiotic|antibacterial]] and [[fungus|antifungal]] agent found in some consumer products, including toothpaste, [[soap]]s, [[detergent]]s, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an [[antimicrobial agent]], the risk of [[antimicrobial resistance]], and its possible role in [[endocrine disruptor|disrupted hormonal development]] remain controversial. Additional research seeks to understand its potential effects on organisms and environmental health.

Triclosan was developed in the 1960s.<ref name=Boy2002>{{cite journal|last1=Boyce|first1=JM|last2=Pittet|first2=D|last3=Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory|first3=Committee.|last4=HICPAC/SHEA/APIC/IDSA Hand Hygiene Task|first4=Force.|title=Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings.

==Chemical structure and properties==
This [[organic compound]] is a white powdered [[solid]] with a slight aromatic, phenolic odor. Categorized as a [[polychloro phenoxy phenol]], triclosan is a [[chlorine|chlorinated]] [[simple aromatic ring|aromatic compound]] that has [[functional group]]s representative of both [[ether]]s and [[phenol]]s. Phenols often demonstrate antibacterial properties. Triclosan is soluble in [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], [[diethyl ether]], and strongly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[solution]]s such as a 1[[concentration#Molarity|M]] [[sodium hydroxide]] solution, but only slightly soluble in water. Triclosan can be synthesized from [[2,4-dichlorophenol]].

===Synthesis===
Under a reflux process, 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-methoxydiphenyl ether is treated with [[aluminium chloride]].<ref>Commonwealth of Australia. Department of Health and Ageing. [http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/public_meetings/052909coms/triclosan/ciba1.pdf National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme. Priority Existing Chemical Assessment Report No. 30]. National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme, Jan. 2009. Web. Apr. 2014.</ref>

Triclosan can be synthesized through a three-step process starting with 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one. The 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one is dehydrated with either [[zinc]] or [[calcium oxide]] into 1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one.<ref>{{cite patent |country=US|number=6982337|status=patent|title=Kahn, A.P. Production of N-Vinyl Pyrrolidone}}., Apr 1, 2004.</ref> Then, 1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one can be reacted with 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenyl acrylate in n-heptane to form triclosan.<ref>{{patent|US|6315987|title=Plochocka, K. Polymeric Delivery and Release Systems for Oral Care Actives}}. Nov 13, 2001.</ref>

The United States Pharmacopeia formulary has published a monograph for triclosan that sets purity standards.<ref name=USP>{{cite book |title=US Pharmacopoeia National Formulary|year=2012|publisher=United States Pharmacopeial|isbn=1936424126|url=http://www.usp.org/}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
At high concentrations, triclosan acts as a [[biocide]] with multiple [[cytoplasm]]ic and [[cell membrane|membrane]] targets.<ref name="pmid15073159">{{cite journal |author=Russell AD |title=Whither triclosan? |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=693–5 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15073159 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkh171}}</ref> However, at the lower concentrations seen in commercial products, triclosan appears [[bacteriostatic]], and it targets bacteria primarily by inhibiting [[fatty acid metabolism#Synthesis|fatty acid synthesis]].

Triclosan binds to bacterial [[enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase]] (ENR) enzyme,<ref name="who06-99-triclosan">[http://www.who.int/patientsafety/information_centre/Last_April_versionHH_Guidelines%5B3%5D.pdf The WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Healthcare (Advanced Draft)], WHO, 2006, page 37 "9.9 Triclosan"</ref> which is encoded by the gene ''FabI''. This binding increases the enzyme's affinity for [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>). This results in the formation of a stable, ternary complex of ENR-NAD<sup>+</sup>-triclosan, which is unable to participate in [[fatty acid]] synthesis. Fatty acids are necessary for building and reproducing cell membranes. Humans do not have an ENR enzyme and thus are not affected by this mode of action.

===Endocrine disruptor===
Triclosan has been found to be a weak [[endocrine disruptor]], though the relevance of this to humans is uncertain.<ref name="pmid24897554">{{cite journal | vauthors = Witorsch RJ | title = Critical analysis of endocrine disruptive activity of triclosan and its relevance to human exposure through the use of personal care products | journal = Crit.

==Exposure==
Humans are exposed to triclosan through skin absorption when washing hands or in the shower, brushing teeth, using mouthwash or doing dishes, and through ingestion when swallowed. When triclosan is released into the environment, additional exposure to the chemical is possible through ingesting plants grown in soil treated with [[sewage sludge]], or eating fish exposed to it.<ref>Halden, p. 3605.</ref>

An article from the [[American Society of Agronomy]] refers to a study done by Monica Mendez ''et al.'', in which the researchers irrigated plants with water contaminated with triclosan and months later found it in all edible parts of [[tomato]] and [[onion]] plants.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mendez | first1 = Monica O. | last2 = Valdez | first2 = Erika M. | last3 = Martinez | first3 = Eileen M. | last4 = Saucedo | first4 = Melissa | last5 = Wilson | first5 = Brittan A. | year = 2016 | title = Fate of Triclosan in Irrigated Soil: Degradation in Soil and Translocation into Onion and Tomato | url = | journal = Journal of Environment Quality | volume = 45 | issue = 3| page = 1029 | doi = 10.2134/jeq2015.07.0386 }}</ref> Triclosan is found to kill a wide spectrum of bacteria, and the researchers are also concerned about the effect it has on the beneficial bacteria in soil.<ref>Izlar, Rossie. (May 25, 2016). Following Tricky Triclosan. Retrieved from American Society of Agronomy, https://www.agronomy.org/science-news/following-tricky-triclosan</ref>

==Distribution, metabolism, and elimination==
Once absorbed, triclosan is metabolized by humans primarily through conjugation reactions into [[glucuronide]] and [[sulfate conjugates]] that are excreted in feces and urine. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that triclosan sulfate and glucuronide may be formed in the liver at approximately equal rates at the environmentally relevant concentration of 1 to 5 microMolar. When concentrations of triclosan are below 1 microMolar, [[sulfonation]] is expected to be the major metabolic pathway for elimination.<ref name="annualreviews.org">Yueh, M., Tukey, R. H.

==Health concerns==
Because of potential health concerns spanning from antimicrobial resistance to endocrine disruption, triclosan has been designated as a "contaminant of emerging concern (CEC)", meaning it is under investigation for public health risk.  "Emerging contaminants" can be broadly defined as any synthetic or naturally occurring chemical or any microorganism that is not commonly monitored in the environment but has the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological and(or) human health effects.<ref>United States Geological Survey.  Contaminants of Emerging Concern in the Environment. Retrieved October 27, 2016, from http://toxics.usgs.gov/investigations/cec/index.php</ref> Triclosan is thought to accumulate in wastewater and return to drinking water, thus propagating a buildup that could cause increasing effects with ongoing use.<ref>Food and Drug Administration. (2016) 5 Things to know about Triclosan. Retrieved from http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm205999.htm</ref>

In an article from May 2015 on the current status of triclosan, Gurpreet Singh Dhillon and colleagues cite various studies that report “emerging health concerns related to the use of TCS such as microbial resistance, dermal irritations, endocrine disruption, higher incidence of allergies, altered thyroid hormone metabolism and tumors development due to TCS and its by-products”.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dhillon | first1 = G.

Triclosan is considered safe by some but is under ongoing review by the FDA.<ref name="fda"/> [[Health Canada]]'s review concluded "that triclosan is not harmful to human health but can cause harm to the environment when used in significant amounts. This preliminary assessment confirms that Canadians can continue to safely use products such as toothpaste, shampoo and soap containing triclosan".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/cosmet-person/labelling-etiquetage/ingredients-eng.php#a4.14|website=Health Canada|publisher=Health Canada |title= Safety of Cosmetic Ingredients}}</ref>

In the United States, after a decades-long review of the potential health issues from this contaminant of emerging concern, the FDA ruled on September 6, 2016, that 19 active ingredients including triclosan are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE).<ref>Food and Drug Administration (2016) FDA issues final rule on safety and effectiveness of antibacterial soaps.  Available at: http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm517478.htm</ref> [See policy section below].

===Allergy===
Triclosan has been associated with a higher risk of [[food allergy]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2012.11.007 |pmid=23199604 |title=Advances in allergic skin disease, anaphylaxis, and hypersensitivity reactions to foods, drugs, and insects in 2012 |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=55–66 |year=2013 |last1=Sicherer |first1=Scott H. |last2=Leung |first2=Donald Y.M.}}</ref> This may be because exposure to bacteria reduces [[allergy|allergies]], as predicted by the [[hygiene hypothesis]], and not caused by toxicology of triclosan itself.

===By-products===
Triclosan can react with the free chlorine in [[Water chlorination|chlorinated tap water]] to produce lesser amounts of other compounds, such as [[2,4-dichlorophenol]]. Some of these intermediates convert into [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] upon exposure to [[UV]] radiation (from the sun or other sources).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11356-011-0632-z |pmid=22057832 |title=Occurrence and toxicity of antimicrobial triclosan and by-products in the environment |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1044–65 |year=2011 |last1=Bedoux |first1=Gilles |last2=Roig |first2=Benoit |last3=Thomas |first3=Olivier |last4=Dupont |first4=Virginie |last5=Le Bot |first5=Barbara}}</ref> The dioxins that can form from triclosan are not considered to be congeners of toxicologic concern for mammals, birds and fish.<ref name=EPA2013>{{cite web |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0811-0002 |title=Triclosan Registration Review Preliminary Work Plan |date=27 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=WHO>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/713810655 |pmid=10912238 |title=Consultation on assessment of the health risk of dioxins; re-evaluation of the tolerable daily intake (TDI): Executive Summary |journal=Food Additives and Contaminants |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=223–40 |year=2000 |last1=van den Berg |first1=M |last2=van Birgelen |first2=A |last3=Birnbaum |first3=L |last4=Brouwer |first4=B |last5=Carrier |first5=G |last6=Dragan |first6=Y |last7=Farland |first7=W |last8=Feeley |first8=M |last9=Fýrst |first9=P |last10=Galli |first10=CL |last11=Greig |first11=J |last12=Hayashi |first12=Y |last13=Kogevinas |first13=M |last14=Kurokawa |first14=Y |last15=Larsen |first15=JC |last16=Liem |first16=AKD |last17=Matsumura |first17=F |last18=Mocarelli |first18=P |last19=Moore |first19=MR |last20=Newhook |first20=RC |last21=Peterson |first21=RE |last22=Poellinger |first22=L |last23=Portier |first23=C |last24=Rogan |first24=WJ |last25=Schrenk |first25=D |last26=Sweeney |first26=MH |last27=Tohyama |first27=C |last28=Tuomisto |first28=J |last29=Water |first39=J |last30=Zeilmaker |first30=M}}</ref>

===Hormone===
Concerns on the health effects of triclosan have been raised after it was detected in human breast milk, blood, and urine samples. While no human data exists, studies on rats have shown that triclosan exposure modulates estrogen-dependent responses.<ref>"Triclosan exposure modulates estrogen-dependent responses in the female wistar rat." Toxicol Sci. 2010 Sep;117(1):45-53. {{doi|10.1093/toxsci/kfq180}}.</ref> There have been many studies performed over the years both in vivo and in vitro, in male and female fish and rats and they all support the conclusion that triclosan possesses (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic properties depending on species, tissues, and cell types.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/>

==History==
Triclosan (TCS) was patented in 1964<ref>{{cite journal | last=Halden | first=Rolf U | title=On the need and speed of regulating triclosan and triclocarban in the United States | journal=Environmental Science and Technology | date=March 3, 2014 | volume=48 | issue=7 | pages=3603–3611 | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es500495p | doi=10.1021/es500495p | accessdate=October 29, 2016 | pmid=24588513 | pmc=3974611}}</ref> by Swiss company [[Ciba-Geigy]].

==Environmental concerns==

===Treatment and disposal===
The duration of triclosan in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, triclosan is sent to municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants, where about 97-98% of triclosan is removed.<ref name=halden>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es500495p |pmid=24588513 |pmc=3974611 |title=On the Need and Speed of Regulating Triclosan and Triclocarban in the United States |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=3603–11 |year=2014 |last1=Halden |first1=Rolf U. |bibcode=2014EnST...48.3603H}}</ref> Studies show that substantial quantities of triclosan (170,000 – 970,000&nbsp;kg/yr) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters.<ref name=halden/> In a study on [[effluent]] from wastewater treatment facilities, approximately 75% of triclocarban was present in sludge.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2010.06.004 |pmid=20797791 |title=Review of 'emerging' organic contaminants in biosolids and assessment of international research priorities for the agricultural use of biosolids |journal=Environment International |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=226–47 |year=2011 |last1=Clarke |first1=Bradley O. |last2=Smith |first2=Stephen R.}}</ref> This poses a potential environmental and ecological hazard, particularly for aquatic systems. The volume of triclosan re-entering the environment in [[sewage]] sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is 44,000 ± 60,000&nbsp;kg/yr.<ref name=halden/> Triclosan can attach to other substances suspended in aquatic environments, which potentially endangers marine organisms and may lead to further bioaccumulation.<ref name=tf>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/triclosan_fs.htm |title=Triclosan Facts |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=17 Feb 2014}}</ref> [[Ozone]] is considered to be an effective tool for removing triclosan during sewage treatment. As little triclosan is released through [[plastics|plastic]] and textile household consumer products, these are not considered to be major sources of triclosan contamination.<ref name=tf/>

During wastewater treatment, a portion of triclosan is degraded, while the remaining adsorbs to sewage [[sludge]] or exits the plant as effluent.<ref name="pmid12523412">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es025750i |pmid=12523412 |title=Triclosan: Occurrence and Fate of a Widely Used Biocide in the Aquatic Environment: Field Measurements in Wastewater Treatment Plants, Surface Waters, and Lake Sediments |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |volume=36 |issue=23 |pages=4998–5004 |year=2002 |last1=Singer |first1=Heinz |last2=Müller |first2=Stephan |last3=Tixier |first3=Céline |last4=Pillonel |first4=Laurent |bibcode=2002EnST...36.4998S}}</ref><ref name="pmid16766013">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.04.066 |pmid=16766013 |title=Mass balance assessment of triclosan removal during conventional sewage treatment |journal=Chemosphere |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=362–9 |year=2007 |last1=Heidler |first1=Jochen |last2=Halden |first2=Rolf U.}}</ref> In the environment, triclosan may be degraded by microorganisms or react with sunlight, forming other compounds, which include chlorophenols and [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]].

During 1999 to 2000, US Geological Survey detected TCS in 57.6% of streams and rivers sampled.<ref>Dhillon, p. 5668.
</ref>

===Bioaccumulation===
While studies using semi-permeable membrane devices have found that triclosan does not strongly bioaccumulate, [[methyl-triclosan]] is comparatively more stable and [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and thus poses a higher risk of bioaccumulation. The ability of triclosan to bioaccumulate is affected by its ionization state in different environmental conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Brausch |first1= John |last2= Rand |first2= Gary |year= 2011 |title= A review of personal care products in the aquatic environment: Environmental concentrations and toxicity |url= |journal= [[Chemosphere (journal)|Chemosphere]] |volume= 82 |issue= 11 |pages= 1518–1532 |doi= 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.11.018}}</ref>

[[Global warming]] may increase uptake and effects of triclosan in aquatic organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Accumulation of triclosan from diet and its neuroendocrine effects in Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) under two temperature Regimes|year=2015|doi=10.1016/j.marenvres.2015.09.006|journal=Marine Environmental Research|authors=Tiffany L. Hedrick-Hoppera, Lauren P. Kostera, Sandra L. Diamond|volume=112|pages=52–60}}</ref>

===Ecotoxicity===
{{Further information|Ecotoxicity}}
Triclosan is toxic to aquatic bacteria at levels found in the environment. It is highly toxic to various types of algae and has the potential to affect the structure of algal communities, particularly immediately downstream of effluents from [[wastewater treatment]] facilities that treat household wastewaters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oehha.org/prop65/public_meetings/052909coms/triclosan/ciba12.pdf |title=Estimates Of Exposures And Risks To Aquatic Organisms From Releases Of Triclosan To Surface Water As A Result Of Uses Under EPA'S Jurisdiction |accessdate=2014-09-22}}</ref> Triclosan has been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic [[Lumbriculus variegatus|blackworm]]s, fish, and [[dolphin]]s. It has also been found in land animals including earthworms and species higher up the [[food chain]].<ref name=halden/>

Triclosan favors anaerobic conditions which is typical in soil and sediment. The antimicrobial properties of Triclosan are resistant to anaerobic degradation which is the main contributor to its persistence in the environment.<ref>Dann, A. B., Hontela, A.

==Resistance concerns==
Concern pertains to the potential for [[cross-resistance]] or [[co-resistance]] to other antimicrobials. Numerous studies have been performed and there have been results indicating that the use of biocidal agents, such as triclosan, can cause cross-resistance. Results from a study published in The American Journal of Infection Control showed that exposure to triclosan was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. This was not observed with exposure to [[chlorhexidine]] or a hydrogen [[peroxide]]-based agent (during the conditions in said study).<ref name="pmid26810885">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2015.11.009 |pmid=26810885 |title=Use of a predictive protocol to measure the antimicrobial resistance risks associated with biocidal product usage |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=458–64 |year=2016 |last1=Westgate |first1=Rebecca |last2=Grasha |first2=Pierre |last3=Maillard |first3=Jean-Yves}}</ref>

==Alternatives==
A comprehensive analysis in 2007 from the University of Michigan School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps are just as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps with triclosan in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/519255 |pmid=17683018 |laysummary=http://phys.org/news106418144.html |laysource=Phys.org |laydate=Aug 15, 2007 |title=Consumer Antibacterial Soaps: Effective or Just Risky? |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=45 |pages=S137–47 |year=2007 |last1=Aiello |first1=A. E. |last2=Larson |first2=E. L. |last3=Levy |first3=S. B.}}</ref>

Nonorganic antibiotics and organic biocides are effective alternatives to triclosan, such as silver and copper ions and [[nanoparticle]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nano.2006.12.001 |pmid= 17379174|title=Antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles |journal=Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine |volume=3 |pages=S137–47 |year=2007 |last1=Kim |first1=Jun Sung |last2=Kuk |first2=Eunye |last3=Yu |first3=Kyeong Nam |last4=Kim |first4=Jong-Ho |last5=Park |first5=Sung Jin |last6=Lee |first6=Hu Jang |last7=Kim |first7=So Hyun |last8=Park |first8=Young Kyung |last9=Park |first9=Yong Ho |last10=Hwang |first10=Cheol-Yong |last11=Kim |first11=Yong-Kwon |last12=Lee |first12=Yoon-Sik |last13=Jeong |first13=Dae Hong |last14=Cho |first14=Myung-Haing}}</ref>

==Policy==
In the US, triclosan is regulated as a pesticide by EPA and as a drug by FDA. EPA generally regulates uses on solid surfaces, and FDA regulations cover uses in personal care products.

In 1974, the US FDA began the drug review monograph process for "over-the-counter (OTC) topical antimicrobial products," including triclosan and triclocarban. The advisory panel first met on June 29, 1972, and the agency published its proposed rule on Sept 13, 1974. The initial rule applied to, “OTC products containing antimicrobial ingredients for topical human use, which includes soaps, surgical scrubs, skin washes, skin cleansers, first aid preparations and additional products defined by the panel.”<ref>Proposal to Establish a Monograph for OTC Topical Antimicrobial Products. Federal Register, vol. 39, no. 179. September 13, 1974. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/UCM107140.pdf
</ref> The proposed rule lists dozens of products that were already on the market at the time and the firms that produced them.

In 1978 FDA published a tentative final monograph (TFM) for topical antimicrobial products. The record was re-opened in March 1979 to take into account six comments the agency received during the period for submitting objections to the TFM, including new data submitted by Procter & Gamble on the safety and effectiveness of triclocarban and by Ciba-Geigy on the proliferation of use of triclosan. The document states that, “significant amounts of new and previously unconsidered data were submitted with each of the above petitions.”<ref>Topical Antimicrobial Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use: Reopening of the Administrative Record. Federal Register, vol. 44, no. 48. March 9, 1979. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/UCM107157.pdf</ref> It was re-opened again in October of that year to permit interested persons to submit further data establishing conditions for the safety, effectiveness and labeling of over-the-counter topical antimicrobial products for human use.

The next document issued was a proposed rule dated June 17, 1994, which states, “FDA is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of an amended tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which OTC topical health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative record for this rulemaking. FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips.”<ref>Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use. Federal Register, vol. 59, no. 116. June 17, 1994. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/UCM110451.pdf</ref> In the 1994 update to the rule, TCS was effectively removed from the drug category which made it available for use in consumer products.<ref>Halden, p. 3606, figure 1.</ref>

In 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council forced the FDA to review triclosan after suing them for their inaction. Because the FDA prohibited [[hexachlorophene]], a compound similar to triclosan, Halden and others argued that the FDA should also ban triclosan.<ref name=halden/> On December 17, 2013, the FDA issued a draft rule revoking the [[Generally recognized as safe]] status of triclosan as an ingredient in hand wash products, citing the need for additional studies of its potential endrocrine and developmental effects; impact on bacterial resistance; and carcinogenic potential.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-17/pdf/2013-29814.pdf |title=Federal Register |accessdate=2014-09-22}}</ref>

On September 6, 2016, 44 years after its initial proposed rule, FDA issued a final rule establishing that 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic products intended for use with water (aka consumer antiseptic washes) are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE) and are misbranded, and are new drugs for which approved applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act are required for marketing.<ref>Safety and Effectiveness of Consumer Antiseptics; Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use. Federal Register, vol. 81, no. 172. September 6, 2016. https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-06/pdf/2016-21337.pdf</ref> Companies have one year to reformulate products without these ingredients, take them off the market or submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for the products. The 19 ingredients are:
◦[[Cloflucarban]]
◦[[Fluorosalan]]
◦[[Hexachlorophene]]
◦[[Hexylresorcinol]]
◦Iodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate)
◦Iodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol)
◦[[Methylbenzethonium chloride]]
◦Nonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine
◦[[Phenol]] (greater than 1.5 percent)
◦Phenol (less than 1.5 percent)
◦[[Poloxamer]]-iodine complex
◦[[Povidone-iodine]] 5 to 10 percent
◦Secondary [[amyltricresols]]
◦[[Sodium oxychlorosene]]
◦[[Tribromsalan]]
◦[[Triclocarban]]
◦Triclosan
◦[[Triple dye]]
◦[[Undecoylium chloride]] iodine complex

In 2015 and 2016 FDA also issued proposed rules to amend the 1994 TFM regarding the safety and effectiveness of OTC health care antiseptics and OTC consumer antiseptic rubs.

The state of Minnesota took action against triclosan in advance of a federal rule. In May 2014, the governor signed a bill banning triclosan-containing products in the state. A ''CNN'' article quotes the new law, "In order to prevent the spread of infectious disease and avoidable infections and to promote best practices in sanitation, no person shall offer for retail sale in Minnesota any cleaning product that contains triclosan and is used by consumers for sanitizing or hand and body cleansing.”<ref>Landau, Elizabeth and Young, Saundra. (May 21, 2014). Minnesota issues ban on antibacterial ingredient. CNN. Retrieved from http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/health/triclosan-ban-antibacterial/</ref> The law goes into effect on Jan 1 2017. The exceptions to this rule are individual products that have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for consumer use.

In light of mounting evidence on the human health and ecotoxic effects of triclosan, some companies reformulated to remove it in advance of regulation: Colgate-Palmolive removed it from Palmolive Dish Soap and Softsoap in 2011 (but it remains in Colgate Total toothpaste); Johnson & Johnson removed it from baby products in 2012 and all products in 2015; Procter & Gamble from all products in 2014; In 2014 it was removed from Clearasil and Avon began phasing it out; and Unilever removed it from skin care and cleansing products in 2015, and says oral care by 2017.<ref>Kary, Tiffany.

In Canada, triclosan is allowed in cosmetics, though FDA’s recent announcement has prompted Health Canada spokeswoman Maryse Durette to state in an e-mail to Toronto newspaper ''The Globe and Mail'' that, “the government will publish a final assessment of the safety of triclosan ‘in the near future’ and take further action ‘if warranted.’”<ref>Weeks, Carly.
