== Medical uses ==
Stavudine is used in the treatment of [[HIV-1 infection]], but is not a cure. It is not normally recommended as initial treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines.pdf|title=Updated Guidelines for Antiretroviral Postexposure Prophylaxis After Sexual, Injection Drug Use, or Other Nonoccupational Exposure to HIV—United States, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=Annals of Emergency Medicine|access-date=11/08/2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120134302/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-20|df=}}{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=August 2017}}</ref> Stavudine can also reduce the risk of developing HIV-1 infection after coming into contact with the virus either at work (e.g., needlestick) or through exposure to infected blood or other bodily fluids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf|title=Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)|access-date=11/08/2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101202407/https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/adultandadolescentgl.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-01|df=}}{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=August 2017}}</ref> It is always used in combination with other HIV medications for the better control of the infection and a reduction in HIV complications.<ref name=":0" />

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends stavudine to be phased out to due to its high toxicity levels. If the drug must be used, it is recommended to use low dosages to reduce the occurrence of side effects; however, a 2015 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane review]] found no clear advantage between high and low dosage regimens.<ref name="Mag2015"/>

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Stavudine has been demonstrated to affect the fetus in animal studies but no data are available from human studies.<ref name=":1" /> Pregnant women should therefore be given stavudine only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential harm to the fetus. Additionally, there have been case reports of fatal [[lactic acidosis]] in pregnant women receiving combination therapy of stavudine and [[didanosine]] with other antiviral agents.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/020412s029,020413s020lbl.pdf|title=Stavudine FDA access|last=|first=|date=|website=FDA.gov|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212042612/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/020412s029,020413s020lbl.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-12|df=}}</ref>

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants, in order to avoid the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/pregnantwomen/|title=Pregnant Women, Infants, and Children {{!}} Gender {{!}} HIV by Group {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=15 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115134135/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/pregnantwomen/|archivedate=15 November 2016|df=}}</ref> There is also evidence that stavudine gets into animal breast milk, although no data are available for human breast milk.<ref name=":1" />

===Children===
Stavudine is safe for use in children infected with HIV from birth through adolescence.  Adverse effects and safety profile are the same as adults.<ref name=":1" />

===Elderly===
There is no data available for stavudine use in HIV-infected adults aged 65 years or older.  However, among 12,000 people over the age of 65, 30% developed [[peripheral neuropathy]].<ref name=":1" />  Additionally, since the elderly are more likely to have decreased renal function, they are more likely to develop toxic side effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073131.pdf|title=FDA Guideline for Industry: Geriatric Population|last=|first=|date=|website=FDA.gov|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914163457/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073131.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-14|df=}}</ref>

==Adverse events==
'''Common side effects'''<ref name=":1" />
* [[Nausea]]
* [[Vomiting]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Headache]]
* Upset stomach
'''Severe side effects'''<ref name=":1" /> 
* [[Peripheral neuropathy]]
* [[Lactic acidosis]]
* [[Pancreatitis]]
* [[Hepatotoxicity]] 
* [[Hepatomegaly]] with [[steatosis]]
* [[Lipoatrophy]]/[[lipodystrophy]] (fat redistribution/accumulation) 
Individuals are monitored for the development of these serious adverse effects. The development of peripheral neuropathy is shown to be dose related, and may be resolved if the drug is discontinued. Individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or individuals on other drugs that have association with neuropathy develop this side effect more often.<ref name=":1" />

Stavudine has been shown in laboratory test to be [[genotoxic]], but with clinical doses its [[carcinogen]]ic effects are non-existent. Hyperlactatemia,  [[bone mineral density]] (BMD) loss, reduction in limb fat and an increase in [[triglycerides]] were found when administered in high dosages. It is also one of the most likely antiviral drugs to cause [[lipodystrophy]], and for this reason it is no longer considered an appropriate treatment for most patients in developed countries.

HLA-B*4001 may be used as a genetic marker to predict which patients will develop stavudine-associated lipodystrophy, to avoid or shorten the duration of stavudine according to a study in Thailand.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Association between HLA-B*4001 and lipodystrophy among HIV-infected patients from Thailand who received a stavudine-containing antiretroviral regimen  |vauthors=Wangsomboonsiri W, Mahasirimongkol S, Chantarangsu S, etal |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |date=February 15, 2010 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=597–604 |doi=10.1086/650003 |pmid=20073992 }}</ref>

It is still used as first choice in first line therapy in resource poor settings such as in India. Only in case of development of peripheral neuropathy or pregnancy is it changed to the next choice, [[zidovudine]]. Safety and effectiveness of dosage titration was not reported in treatment naive patients. It was only reported in those patients with sustained virologic suppression. These findings are not generalized to Stavudine used in ART naive patients who have high viral loads.

On Monday 30 November 2009, the [[World Health Organization]] stated that "[The WHO] recommends that countries phase out the use of Stavudine, or d4T, because of its long-term, irreversible side-effects. Stavudine is still widely used in first-line therapy in developing countries due to its low cost and widespread availability. [[Zidovudine]] (AZT) or [[tenofovir]] (TDF) are recommended as less toxic and equally effective alternatives."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/world_aids_20091130/en/index.html |title=New HIV recommendations to improve health, reduce infections and save lives |date=November 30, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118152820/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/world_aids_20091130/en/index.html |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |df= }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Stavudine is a nucleoside [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[thymidine]]. It is phosphorylated by cellular [[kinase]]s into an active triphosphate. Stavudine triphosphate inhibits HIV’s [[reverse transcriptase]] by competing with the natural substrate, [[thymidine triphosphate]]. [[Reverse transcriptase]] is the enzyme the virus uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA in order to insert its genetic material into the host’s DNA. Upon incorporation into the DNA strand, stavudine triphosphate causes termination of [[DNA replication]].

== Pharmacokinetics ==
'''Absorption:''' Stavudine has rapid absorption and good oral bioavailability &nbsp;(F = 0.86).<ref name=":0" />

'''Distribution:''' Stavudine does not bind to proteins in the blood.<ref name=":0" />

'''Metabolism:''' The clearance of stavudine is affected minimally by hepatic metabolism. [[Oxidation]] and [[glucuronidation]] produce minor metabolites.<ref name=":0" />

'''Elimination:''' Stavudine is mostly eliminated in the urine and mostly in its unchanged form.<ref name=":0" />

== Drug interactions ==
Simultaneous use of [[zidovudine]] is not recommended, as it can inhibit the intracellular [[phosphorylation]] of stavudine. Other anti-HIV drugs do not possess this property.

Stavudine is not protein-bound nor does it inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms. Thus, significant drug interactions with drugs metabolized through these pathways or drugs that are protein-bound are unlikely.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://packageinserts.bms.com/pi/pi_zerit.pdf|title=Zerit (stavudine) capsules and powder for oral solution prescribing information|last=Bristol-Myers Squibb|first=|date=December 2012|website=|publisher=Princeton, NJ|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131071434/http://packageinserts.bms.com/pi/pi_zerit.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}</ref>

==History==
Stavudine was first created by [[Jerome Horwitz]] in the 1960s and was originally named D4T.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9577446/Jerome-Horwitz.html|title=Jerome Horwitz|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107155512/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9577446/Jerome-Horwitz.html|archivedate=2016-11-07|df=}}</ref> When the AIDS epidemic occurred in the 1980s, [[William Prusoff]] and Dr. Tai-Shun Lin discovered the anti-HIV properties of Stavudine.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/opinion/the-scientists-story.html|title=The Scientist's Story|last=Prusoff|first=William|date=2001-03-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107093059/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/opinion/the-scientists-story.html|archivedate=2016-11-07|df=}}</ref> The pharmaceutical company [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] manufactures the drug under the trade name Zerit.<ref name=":02" />

It is also the first drug to be granted parallel track status in 1992 by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which allowed for the agency to make Stavudine available to patients before being approved. Stavudine was submitted under the FDA’s accelerated approval process. Through this process, Stavudine’s effectiveness was measured by its effect on the [[Surrogate markers|surrogate marker]], [[CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity|CD4]], instead of clinical endpoints. The FDA concluded that an increase in CD4 cell counts was an indicator of how effective the drug would be against AIDS and HIV infection. Stavudine was the fourth drug to be approved for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection by the FDA on June 27, 1994. Even after approval, studies were continued to evaluate the clinical benefit of the drug. If there is no indication of clinical benefits, the accelerated approval may be withdrawn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/news/116/fda-approval-of-stavudine--d4t-|title=FDA Approval of Stavudine (d4T) {{!}} News {{!}} AIDSinfo|website=AIDSinfo|access-date=2016-11-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107092411/https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/news/116/fda-approval-of-stavudine--d4t-|archivedate=2016-11-07|df=}}</ref>
