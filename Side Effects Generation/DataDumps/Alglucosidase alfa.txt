'''Alglucosidase alfa''' ('''Lumizyme''', '''Myozyme''', [[Genzyme]]) is an [[enzyme replacement therapy]] (ERT) [[orphan drug]] for treatment of Pompe disease ([[Glycogen storage disease type II]]), a [[rare disease|rare]] [[lysosomal storage disorder]] (LSD).<ref name="Kishnani01">{{cite journal |author=Kishnani PS |title=Recombinant human acid [alpha]-glucosidase: major clinical benefits in infantile-onset Pompe disease |journal=Neurology |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=99–109 |year=2007 |pmid=17151339 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000251268.41188.04 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Corzo D |author3=Nicolino M |display-authors=3 |last4=Byrne |first4=B. |last5=Mandel |first5=H. |last6=Hwu |first6=W.

Chemically speaking, the drug is an [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]] of the enzyme that is deficient in patients affected by Pompe disease, [[alpha-glucosidase]]. It is the first drug available to treat this disease.<ref name=FDA2006/>

==Status==
[[Orphan drug]] pharmaceutical company, [[Genzyme]], markets alglucosidase alfa as "Myozyme". In 2006, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Myozyme as a suitable ERT treatment for children.<ref name=FDA2006>

Some health plans have refused to subsidize Myozyme for adult patients because it lacks approval for treatment in adults, as well as its high cost ([[US dollar|US$]]300,000/yr for life).<ref>{{cite news |author=Geeta Anand |title=As Costs Rise, New Medicines Face Pushback |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119007210553130427 |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |date=2007-09-18 |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

On August 1, 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of Lumizyme (alglucosidase alfa) for treatment of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, including patients who are less than 8 years of age. In addition, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) known as the Lumizyme ACE (Alglucosidase Alfa Control and Education) Program is being eliminated.<ref name="FDA 2014 NEws & Events">

==Side effects==
Common observed adverse reactions to alglucosidase alfa treatment are [[pneumonia]], respiratory complications, [[infection]]s and [[fever]]. More serious reactions reported include [[heart failure|heart]] and [[lung failure]] and [[allergy|allergic shock]]. Myozyme boxes carry warnings regarding the possibility of life-threatening allergic response.<ref name=FDA2006/>
