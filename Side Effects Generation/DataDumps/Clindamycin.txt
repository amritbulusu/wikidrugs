=== D-Test ===
[[File:D test.jpg|thumb|D test]]
When testing a Gram-positive culture for sensitivity to clindamycin, it is common to perform a "D-Test" to determine if there is a [[macrolide]]-resistant subpopulation of [[bacteria]] present. This test is necessary because some bacteria express a [[phenotype]] known as MLS<sub>B</sub>, in which susceptibility tests will indicate the bacteria are susceptible to clindamycin, but ''in vitro'' the pathogen displays inducible [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]].

To perform a D-test, an [[agar]] plate is inoculated with the bacteria in question and two drug-impregnated disks (one with [[erythromycin]], one with clindamycin) are placed 15–20&nbsp;mm apart on the plate. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is "D" shaped, the test result is positive and clindamycin should not be used due to the possibility of resistant [[pathogens]] and therapy failure. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is circular, the test result is negative and clindamycin can be used.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Charles|title=Macrolide-Inducible Resistance to Clindamycin and the D-Test|url=http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Documents/CR.Macrolide-Inducible%20Resistance.Dec09.pdf|accessdate=2012-06-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107115031/http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Documents/CR.Macrolide-Inducible%20Resistance.Dec09.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-07|df=}}</ref>

=== Malaria ===
Given with [[chloroquine]] or [[quinine]], clindamycin is effective and well tolerated in treating ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, and is the treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where [[drug resistance|resistance]] to chloroquine is common.<ref name="Lell">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lell B, Kremsner PG |title=Clindamycin as an Antimalarial Drug: Review of Clinical Trials |journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy]] |issn=0066-4804 |volume=46 |issue=8 |pages=2315–20 |year=2002 |pmid=12121898 |doi=10.1128/AAC.46.8.2315-2320.2002 |pmc=127356 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/46/8/2315.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929084456/http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/46/8/2315.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}</ref><ref name="Griffith">{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffith KS, Lewis LS, Mali S, Parise ME |title=Treatment of malaria in the United States: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=20 |pages=2264–77 |year=2007 |pmid=17519416 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.20.2264 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/297/20/2264.full.pdf }}</ref> Clindamycin should not be used as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action.<ref name="Lell"/><ref name="Griffith"/> Patient-derived isolates of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by ''in vitro'' drug susceptibility testing.<ref name="Dharia">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dharia NV, Plouffe D, Bopp SE, González-Páez GE, Lucas C, Salas C, Soberon V, Bursulaya B, Kochel TJ, Bacon DJ, Winzeler EA |title=Genome scanning of Amazonian Plasmodium falciparum shows subtelomeric instability and clindamycin-resistant parasites |journal=[[Genome Research]] |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1534–44 |year=2010 |pmid=20829224 |doi=10.1101/gr.105163.110 |pmc=2963817 |url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/20/11/1534.long |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107115031/http://genome.cshlp.org/content/20/11/1534.long |archivedate=2016-01-07 |df= }}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Clindamycin has a primarily [[bacteriostatic]] effect. It is a bacterial [[protein synthesis inhibitor]] by inhibiting ribosomal translocation,<ref>[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/mc3/clindamycin Clindamycin] University of Michigan. Retrieved July 31, 2009</ref> in a similar way to [[macrolide]]s. It does so by binding to the [[50S]] rRNA of the large bacterial [[ribosome]] subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the [[oxazolidinone]], [[pleuromutilin]], and [[macrolide]] antibiotics, among others.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web | url = http://www.merck.com/mmpe/print/sec14/ch170/ch170g.html | title = Lincosamides, Oxazolidinones, and Streptogramins | date = November 2005 | accessdate = 2007-12-01 | publisher = [[Merck & Co.]] | work = [[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202164507/http://www.merck.com/mmpe/print/sec14/ch170/ch170g.html | archivedate = 2007-12-02 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Daniel N.|title=Ribosome-targeting antibiotics and mechanisms of bacterial resistance|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrmicro3155|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=35–48|doi=10.1038/nrmicro3155}}</ref>
