'''Rotigotine''' ('''Neupro''') is a [[dopamine agonist]] of the non-[[ergoline]] class of medications indicated for the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) and [[restless legs syndrome]] (RLS).<ref name="pmid19947805">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen JJ, Swope DM, Dashtipour K, Lyons KE | title = Transdermal rotigotine: a clinically innovative dopamine-receptor agonist for the management of Parkinson's disease | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1452–67 |date=December 2009 | pmid = 19947805 | doi = 10.1592/phco.29.12.1452 | url = http://www.atypon-link.com/doi/abs/10.1592/phco.29.12.1452}}</ref><ref name="pmid19956807">{{cite journal | author = Davies S | title = Rotigotine for restless legs syndrome | journal = Drugs of Today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998) | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 663–8 |date=September 2009 | pmid = 19956807 | doi = 10.1358/dot.2009.45.9.1399952 | url = http://journals.prous.com/journals/servlet/xmlxsl/pk_journals.xml_summaryn_pr?p_JournalId=4&p_RefId=1399952}}</ref> It is formulated as a once-daily [[transdermal patch]] which provides a slow and constant supply of the drug over the course of 24 hours.<ref name="pmid19947805"/><ref name="pmid19947805"/>

== History ==
Rotigotine was first developed in 1985 as N-0437 by a team from the [[University of Groningen]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2933633 | volume=7 | issue=5 | title=Synthesis and radioreceptor binding activity of N-0437, a new, extremely potent and selective D2 dopamine receptor agonist | year=1985 | journal=Pharm Weekbl Sci | pages=208–11 | vauthors=Horn AS, Tepper P, Van der Weide J, Watanabe M, Grigoriadis D, Seeman P | doi=10.1007/bf02307578}}</ref> Development was then continued by [[Aderis Pharmaceuticals]]. In 1998, Aderis licensed worldwide development and commercialization rights for rotigotine to the [[Germany|German]] [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Schwarz Pharma]] (today a subsidiary of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] company [[UCB (company)|UCB S.A.]]).<ref>Development & Commercialization of rotigotine by Aderis ([http://www.aderis.com/products/rotigotine.htm Aderis Pharmaceuticals making a reference for the commercialization of rotigotine])</ref>

The drug has been approved by the [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]] for use in Europe in 2006 and is today being sold in several European countries. In 2007, the Neupro patch was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as the first transdermal treatment of Parkinson's disease in the [[United States]]. However, as of 2008, Schwarz Pharma has recalled all Neupro patches in the United States and some in Europe because of problems with the delivery mechanism.  The patch was reformulated, and was reintroduced in the United States in 2012.<ref>[http://www.pdf.org/en/media_pr/release/pr_1342559027 Neupro Patch Re-launches in the US]</ref>

Rotigotine has been authorized as a treatment for restless legs syndrome since August 2008.<ref name="pmid19956807"/>

== Pharmacology ==
Rotigotine acts as a non-selective [[agonist]] of the [[dopamine receptor|dopamine]] [[Dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub>]], [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[Dopamine receptor D3|D<sub>3</sub>]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Dopamine receptor D4|D<sub>4</sub>]] and [[Dopamine receptor D5|D<sub>5</sub>]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, with highest [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] for the D<sub>3</sub> receptor.<ref name="WoodDubois2015">{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Martyn|last2=Dubois|first2=Vanessa|last3=Scheller|first3=Dieter|last4=Gillard|first4=Michel|title=Rotigotine is a potent agonist at dopamine D1receptors as well as at dopamine D2and D3receptors|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|volume=172|issue=4|year=2015|pages=1124–1135|issn=0007-1188|doi=10.1111/bph.12988|pmid=25339241|pmc=4314200}}</ref> In terms of [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]], rotigotine has 10-fold selectivity for the D<sub>3</sub> receptor over the D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, and D<sub>5</sub> receptors and 100-fold selectivity for the D<sub>3</sub> receptor over the D<sub>1</sub> receptor.<ref name="WoodDubois2015" /> In functional studies however, rotigotine behaves as a [[full agonist]] of D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, and D<sub>3</sub> with similar potencies ([[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]]).<ref name="WoodDubois2015" /> Its ability to activate both [[D1-like receptor|D<sub>1</sub>-like]] and [[D2-like receptor|D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor]]s is similar to the case of [[apomorphine]] (which notably has greater [[efficacy]] in the treatment of Parkinson's disease than D<sub>2</sub>-like-selective agonists but has suboptimal [[pharmacokinetic]] properties) and [[pergolide]] but unlike [[pramipexole]] and [[ropinirole]].<ref name="WoodDubois2015" />

All affinities listed were assayed using [[human]] materials except that for α<sub>2B</sub>-adrenergic which was done with [[NG 108–15]] cells. Rotigotine behaves as a [[partial agonist|partial]] or [[full agonist]] (depending on the assay) at all dopamine receptors listed, as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] at the α<sub>2B</sub>-adrenergic receptor, and as a partial agonist at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor.<ref name="pmid18704368"/> Though it has affinity for a large number of sites as shown above, at clinical doses rotigotine behaves mostly as a [[binding selectivity|selective]] D<sub>1</sub>-like (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>5</sub>) and D<sub>2</sub>-like (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>) receptor agonist, with its α<sub>2B</sub>-adrenergic and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> activity also possibly having some minor relevance.
