'''Nebivolol''' is a [[beta blocker|β<sub>1</sub> receptor blocker]] with [[Nitrovasodilator|nitric oxide-potentiating vasodilatory effect]] used in treatment of [[hypertension]] and, in Europe, also for [[left ventricular failure]].<ref name="pmid17661735">{{cite journal |vauthors=de Boer RA, Voors AA, van Veldhuisen DJ |title=Nebivolol: third-generation beta-blockade |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=1539–50 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17661735 |doi=10.1517/14656566.8.10.1539 |url=}}</ref> It is highly [[Cardioselective beta-blockers|cardioselective]] under certain circumstances.<ref name="pmid17661735" />

==Pharmacology and biochemistry==

=== β1 Selectivity ===

[[Beta blocker]]s help patients with cardiovascular disease by blocking β receptors, while many of the side-effects of these medications are caused by their blockade of β2 receptors.<ref name="pmid10453968 ">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tafreshi MJ, Weinacker AB |title=Beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in bronchospastic diseases: a therapeutic dilemma |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=974–8 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10453968 |doi= 10.1592/phco.19.11.974.31575|url=}}</ref> For this reason, beta blockers that selectively block β1 [[adrenergic receptor]]s (termed cardioselective or β1-selective beta blockers) produce fewer adverse effects (for instance, bronchoconstriction) than those drugs that non-selectively block both β1 and β2 receptors.

:{{cquote|Bystolic is associated with a number of serious risks. Bystolic is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh > B) and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of the product. Bystolic therapy is also associated with warnings regarding abrupt cessation of therapy, cardiac failure, angina and acute myocardial infarction, bronchospastic diseases, anesthesia and major surgery, diabetes and hypoglycemia, thyrotoxicosis, peripheral vascular disease, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers use, as well as precautions regarding use with [[CYP2D6]] inhibitors, impaired renal and hepatic function, and anaphylactic reactions. Finally, Bystolic is associated with other risks as described in the Adverse Reactions section of its PI. For example, a number of treatment-emergent adverse events with an incidence greater than or equal to 1 percent in Bystolic-treated patients and at a higher frequency than placebo-treated patients were identified in clinical studies, including headache, fatigue, and dizziness.}}

===FDA warning letter about advertising claims===
In late August 2008, the FDA issued a [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]] to Forest Laboratories citing exaggerated and misleading claims in their launch journal ad, in particular over claims of superiority and novelty of action.<ref name="Thomas Abrams 2008"/>

==History==
Mylan Laboratories licensed the U.S. and Canadian rights to nebivolol from [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] N.V. in 2001. Nebivolol is already registered and successfully marketed in more than 50 countries, including the United States where it is marketed under the brand name Bystolic from [[Mylan Laboratories]] and [[Forest Laboratories]]. Nebivolol is manufactured by Forest Laboratories.

In India, nebivolol is available as Nebistol (Eris life-sciences), Nebicip (Cipla ltd), Nebilong (Micro Labs), Nebistar (Lupin ltd), Nebicard (Torrent), Nubeta ([[Abbot Laboratories|Abbott]] Healthcare Pvt Ltd – India), and Nodon (Cadila Pharmaceuticals). In Greece and Italy, nebivolol is marketed by [[Menarini]] as Lobivon. In the Middle East, Russia and in Australia, it is marketed under the name Nebilet and in Pakistan it is marketed by The Searle Company Limited as Byscard.

==Synthesis==
[[File:Nebivolol synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Nebivolol synthesis: {{US patent|4654362}} with dihydro, not tetrahydro[[chromone]] rings and positional F isomers.]]

Exhaustive hydrogenation of the [[chromone]] ('''1''') leads to a reduction of both the [[olefin]] and the [[ketone]] group (cf. [[ablukast]] also). The carboxylic acid then undergoes partial reduction to an [[aldehyde]] (''2'') by means of [[DIBAL]]. Reaction of that intermediate with the [[ylide]] from [[trimethylsulfonium iodide]] gives the [[oxirane]] ('''3''') via an addition-displacement process. Treatment of an excess of that [[epoxide]] with [[benzylamine]] leads to the addition of two equivalents of that compound with each basic nitrogen ('''4'''). The product is then debenzylated by catalytic reduction over palladium to afford nebivolol ('''5'''). The presence of four chiral centers in the product predicts existence of 16 chiral pairs.
