'''Nateglinide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade name '''Starlix''') is a [[drug]] for the treatment of [[type 2 diabetes]]. Nateglinide was developed by [[Ajinomoto]], a Japanese company and sold by the Swiss pharmaceutical company [[Novartis]].

Nateglinide belongs to the [[meglitinide]] class of blood glucose-lowering drugs.

==Pharmacology==
Nateglinide lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of [[insulin]] from the [[pancreas]]. It achieves this by closing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent [[potassium channels]] in the membrane of the [[beta cells|β cells]]. This depolarizes the [[beta cells|β cells]] and causes [[voltage-gated calcium channels]] to open. The resulting calcium influx induces fusion of insulin-containing vesicles with the cell membrane, and [[insulin]] secretion occurs.

==Contraindications==
Nateglinide is contraindicated in patients who:
* have known [[hypersensitivity]] to the compound or any ingredient in the formulation.
* are affected with type 1 (namely insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.
* are in [[diabetic ketoacidosis]].

==Comparisons with other drugs for type 2 diabetes==
A study funded by [[Novo Nordisk]], the U.S. distributor for [[Repaglinide]], compared their product with Nateglinide in "A randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter 16-week clinical trial".<ref>{{Citation

==Dosage==
Nateglinide is delivered in 60&nbsp;mg & 120&nbsp;mg tablet form.
