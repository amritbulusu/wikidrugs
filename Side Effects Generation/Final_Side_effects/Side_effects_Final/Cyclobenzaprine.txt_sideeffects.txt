The sedative effects of cyclobenzaprine are likely due to its antagonistic effect on [[H1 receptor|histamine]], [[Serotonin receptor|serotonin]], and [[muscarinic receptor]]s. Agitation is a common side effect observed especially in the elderly. In general, the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] recommends avoiding the use of cyclobenzaprine in the elderly because of the potential for more severe side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |accessdate=22 February 2010 |title=High risk medications |format=PDF |work=[[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201113909/http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related [[tricyclic]], such as [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.<ref name=chabria>{{cite journal |last = Chabria |first = Shiven B |url = http://www.occup-med.com/content/1/1/16 |journal = Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology |title = Rhabdomyolysis: a manifestation of cyclobenzaprine toxicity |date = 17 July 2006 |volume = 1 |page = 16 |pmid = 16846511 |doi = 10.1186/1745-6673-1-16 |pmc = 1540431 |issue = 1 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061021190258/http://www.occup-med.com/content/1/1/16 |archivedate = 21 October 2006 }}</ref>

 


 
Some experts believe that cyclobenzaprine should be avoided in elderly patients because it can cause confusion, delirium, and cognitive impairment.<ref>Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2015 Feb 23.
