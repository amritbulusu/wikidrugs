Amantadine has been associated with several [[central nervous system]] (CNS) side effects, likely due to amantadine's [[dopaminergic]] and [[adrenergic]] activity, and to a lesser extent, its activity as an [[anticholinergic]]. CNS side effects include nervousness, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating, and exacerbations of pre-existing seizure disorders and psychiatric symptoms in patients with [[schizophrenia]] or Parkinson's disease. The usefulness of amantadine as an anti-parkinsonian drug is somewhat limited by the need to screen patients for a history of seizures and psychiatric symptoms.
