Several cases of progressive bilateral hearing loss unresponsive to steroid therapy have been described as an infrequent adverse reaction to hydrocodone/paracetamol misuse. This adverse effect has been considered by some to be due to the [[ototoxicity]] of hydrocodone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friedman RA, House JW, Luxford WM, Gherini S, Mills D |title=Profound hearing loss associated with hydrocodone/acetaminophen abuse |journal=Am J Otol |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=188–91 |date=Mar 2000 |pmid=10733182 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0709(00)80007-1 |last2=House |last3=Luxford |last4=Gherini |last5=Mills }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Ho T, Vrabec JT, Burton AW |title=Hydrocodone use and sensorineural hearing loss |journal=Pain Physician |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=467–72 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17525781 |url=http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/linkout_vw.php?issn=1533-3159&vol=10&page=467 |last2=Vrabec |last3=Burton |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723082234/http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/linkout_vw.php?issn=1533-3159&vol=10&page=467 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Other researchers have suggested that paracetamol is the primary agent responsible for the [[ototoxicity]].<ref>{{Cite journal

Hydrocodone is in U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) [[pregnancy category]] C. No adequate and well-controlled studies in humans have been conducted. A newborn of a mother taking opioid medications regularly prior to the birth will be physically dependent. The baby may also exhibit respiratory depression if the opioid dose was high.<ref name=reprexain /> An epidemiological study indicated that opioid treatment during early pregnancy results in increased risk of various birth defects.<ref>{{Cite journal

Symptoms of hydrocodone [[drug overdose|overdose]] include narrowed or widened pupils; slow, shallow, or stopped breathing; slowed or stopped heartbeat; cold, clammy, or blue skin; excessive sleepiness; loss of consciousness; seizures; or death.<ref name='medlineplus' />

 


 
Hydrocodone can be habit forming, causing physical and psychological dependence. Its abuse liability is similar to morphine and less than oxycodone.<ref>{{Cite journal
