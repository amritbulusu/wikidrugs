The side-effect profile is comparable to other TCAs and TeCAS and many of the following are due to [[anticholinergic]] (which are less prominent than those of most TCAs) and [[antihistamine]] effects.<ref name = DrugDex /> Most often seen are:

 


 
* [[Dizziness]]

 
* Drowsiness

 
* [[Somnolence]]

 
* [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]]

 
* [[Xerostomia|Dry mouth]] (and complications of long-term uncontrolled dry mouth such as [[dental caries]]) 

 
* [[Constipation]]

 
* [[Vertigo]]

 
* [[Nausea]] (rare, incidence of ~2%) and vomiting

 
* Increased appetite and weight gain

 
* [[Orthostatic hypotension]], [[hypertension]], [[sinus tachycardia]], [[heart-block]], [[arrhythmias]] and other cardiac effects

 
* [[Sexual dysfunction]] in men: [[erectile dysfunction|impotence]], [[priapism]], [[delayed ejaculation]], [[anejaculation]], [[Hypoactive sexual disorder|decreased libido]]

 
* Sexual dysfunction in women: decreased libido, [[vaginal dryness]], [[Dyspareunia|painful sexual intercourse]], [[anorgasmia]]

 
* Allergic skin reactions such as [[rash]] or [[urticaria]] (more often than with other antidepressants). Rarely, severe skin reactions such as [[erythema multiforme]] can occur.

 
* [[Photosensitivity]]

 
* Agitation, confusion

 
* Induction of [[hypomania]] or [[mania]] in patients suffering from underlying [[bipolar affective disorder]]

 
* [[Psychotic]] symptoms

 
* [[Tremor]]

 
* [[Extrapyramidal symptoms]]

 
* [[Headache]]

 
* [[Seizure]]s (at high doses)

 
* Rare haematological complications: [[leukopenia]] and [[agranulocytosis]] (dangerous fall in white blood cells)

 
* [[Fever]]

 
* Urinary retention

 


 
Maprotiline causes a strong initial sedation (first 2 to 3 weeks of therapy) and is therefore indicated to treat agitated patients or those with suicidal risks. It causes [[anticholinergic]] side effects (dry mouth, constipation, confusion, tachycardia) with a lower incidence than [[amitriptyline]]. Originally, the manufacturer claimed that maprotiline is better tolerated than other TCAs and TeCAs. However, seizures, leukopenia and skin reactions occur more often with maprotiline than with comparable drugs like amitriptyline.

 


 
Maprotiline has no known potential for abuse and psychological dependence.
