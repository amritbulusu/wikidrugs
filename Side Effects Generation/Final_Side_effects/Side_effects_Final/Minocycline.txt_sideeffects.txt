Occasionally minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug related [[lupus]] and auto-immune hepatitis; minocycline induced auto-immune hepatitis when it occurs usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline induced lupus, however, women are the most likely to develop minocycline induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline induced autoimmune problems within a period of a couple of weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy.<ref name="pmid18200008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mongey AB, Hess EV |title=Drug insight: autoimmune effects of medications-what's new? |journal=Nat Clin Pract Rheumatol |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=136–44 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18200008 |doi=10.1038/ncprheum0708 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrrheum/journal/v4/n3/pdf/ncprheum0708.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="pmid20642295">{{cite journal |author=Ochsendorf F |title=Minocycline in acne vulgaris: benefits and risks |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=327–41 |year=2010 |pmid=20642295 |doi=10.2165/11319280-000000000-00000 |url=}}</ref> [[Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms]] (DRESS) syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline.<ref name="pmid20642295"/>

 


 
Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause ''vestibular disturbances'' with [[dizziness]], [[ataxia]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and [[tinnitus]]. These effects are again thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. Vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, occurring in 50% to 70% of women receiving minocycline. As a result of the frequency of this bothersome side effect, minocycline is rarely used in female patients.<ref>{{cite book

Symptoms of an allergic reaction include [[rash]], itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing.<ref name=MedNet /> Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause [[idiopathic intracranial hypertension]] (pseudotumor cerebri),<ref name="pmid15675888">{{cite journal |author=Friedman DI |title=Medication-induced intracranial hypertension in dermatology |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 |year=2005 |pmid=15675888 |doi= 10.2165/00128071-200506010-00004|url=}}</ref> a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage.

 


 
Thyroid cancer has been reported in the post-marketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

 


 
In 2009, the FDA added minocycline to its Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS); a list of medications under investigation by the FDA for potential safety issues. The AERS cites a potential link between the use of minocycline products and [[autoimmune disease]] in pediatric patients.<ref name=AERSlist>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm185260.htm FDA Adverse Events Reporting System] Retrieved on January 16, 2011</ref>
