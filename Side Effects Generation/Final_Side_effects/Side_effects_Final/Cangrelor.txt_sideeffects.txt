Despite fewer bleeding events during cardiac surgery, cangrelor carries the risk of potential autoimmune reactions manifesting as breathlessness.<ref name= Serebruany >{{cite journal | author = Serebruany V.L.  | year = 2014 | title = Dyspnea and Reversibility of Antiplatelet Agents: Ticagrelor, Elinogrel, Cangrelor, and Beyond | journal = Cardiology | volume = 127| pages = 20â€“24 | doi=10.1159/000354876|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Potential mechanisms for dyspnea following cangrelor treatment include: repeated binding and unbinding cycles, impaired platelet turnover, and lung sequestration or apoptosis of overloaded destructive platelets.<ref name= Serebruany/> The dyspnea risks following cangrelor treatment, suggest a common mechanism linking transfusion-related acute lung injury, dyspnea, and reversible platelet inhibition.<ref name= Serebruany/>

 


 
The risk of [[breathlessness]] after intravenous cangrelor is smaller when compared with other reversible platelet [[Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor|P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor inhibitors]], however, it is still significantly higher when compared to irreversible oral antiplatelet drugs or intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors; which do not increase the incidence of breathlessness at all.<ref name= Serebruany/>
