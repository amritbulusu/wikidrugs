Chronic administration of zuclopenthixol (30&nbsp;mg/kg/day for two years) in rats resulted in small, but significant, increases in the incidence of thyroid parafollicular carcinomas and, in females, of mammary adenocarcinomas and of pancreatic islet cell adenomas and carcinomas. An increase in the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas is a common finding for D<sub>2</sub> antagonists which increase prolactin secretion when administered to rats. An increase in the incidence of pancreatic islet cell tumours has been observed for some other D<sub>2</sub> antagonists. The physiological differences between rats and humans with regard to prolactin make the clinical significance of these findings unclear.

 


 
Other permanent side effects are similar to many other typical antipsychotics, namely [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] as a result of dopamine blockade in subcortical areas of the brain. This may result in symptoms similar to those seen in [[Parkinson's disease]] and include a restlessness and inability to sit still known as [[akathisia]], a slow tremor and stiffness of the limbs.<ref name = "Cochzuclo"/> Zuclopenthixol is thought to be more sedating than the related [[flupentixol]], though possibly less likely to induce extrapyramidal symptoms than other typical depots.<ref name = "Cochzuclo2"/> As with other dopamine antagonists, zuclopenthixol may sometimes elevate [[prolactin]] levels; this may occasionally result in [[amenorrhoea]] or [[galactorrhoea]] in severe cases. [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is a rare but potentially fatal side effect. Any unexpected deterioration in mental state with confusion and muscle stiffness should be seen by a physician.

 


 
Zuclopenthixol decanoate induces a transient dose-dependent sedation. However, if the patient is switched to maintenance treatment with zuclopenthixol decanoate from oral zuclopenthixol or from i.m. zuclopenthixol acetate the sedation will be no problem. Tolerance to the unspecific sedative effect develops rapidly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hpra.ie/img/uploaded/swedocuments/LicenseSPC_PA0115-005-007_03062015110150.pdf|title=Summary of Product Characteristics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>
