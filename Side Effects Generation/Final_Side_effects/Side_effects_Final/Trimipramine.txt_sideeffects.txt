The side effects of trimipramine have been said to be similar to those of other tertiary amine TCAs, with a preponderance of [[anticholinergic]] and [[sedative]] effects.<ref name="pmid2693051" /> However, trimipramine has also been said to be associated with a different side effect profile compared to other TCAs and in general with fewer side effects, chiefly due to its lack of [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibition]] and relatively lower anticholinergic effects (although it is still a potent anticholinergic).<ref name="pmid2693055" /><ref name="pmid2693051" /> [[Somnolence]] is the most common side effect of the drug.<ref name="pmid2693051" /> [[Dry mouth]] is the most common anticholinergic side effect, but others like [[constipation]], [[urinary retention]], and [[blurred vision]] are also present.<ref name="pmid2693051" />

 


 
It is described as being associated with minimal or no [[orthostatic hypotension]], at least in comparison to [[clomipramine]],<ref name="pmid8863001" /><ref name="pmid2693055" /><ref name="pmid8863001" /> in spite of its potent and comparable activity as an [[alpha-1 blocker]].<ref name="pmid6086881" /><ref name="pmid2693051" /> However, it has also been said to have a rate of orthostatic hypotension similar to that of other TCAs.<ref name="pmid2693051" /> Trimipramine is said to be less [[epileptogenic]] than other TCAs, although [[seizure]]s have still been reported in association with it.<ref name="pmid2693055" /> It is also less [[cardiotoxic]] than other TCAs<ref name="pmid2693055" /> and cardiotoxicity is said to be minimal, with a "very favorable profile".<ref name="pmid2693051" />
