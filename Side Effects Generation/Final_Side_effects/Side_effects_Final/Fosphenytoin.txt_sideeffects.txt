Side effects are similar to intravenous phenytoin and include hypotension, cardiac [[arrhythmias]], CNS adverse events ([[nystagmus]], dizziness, sedation/somnolence, [[ataxia]] and [[stupor]]), and local dermatological reactions. [[Purple glove syndrome]] probably occurs with fosphenytoin but possibly at lower frequency than with intravenous phenytoin. Fosphenytoin can cause [[hyperphosphatemia]] in end-stage [[renal failure]] patients.<ref name=not_in_kidney_failure>{{cite journal |vauthors=McBryde KD, Wilcox J, Kher KK | title=Hyperphosphatemia due to fosphenytoin in a pediatric ESRD patient | journal=Pediatric Nephrology (Berlin, Germany) | volume=20 | issue=8 | year=2005 | pages=1182â€“5 | pmid=15965770 | format = PDF | doi=10.1007/s00467-005-1947-0}}</ref>
