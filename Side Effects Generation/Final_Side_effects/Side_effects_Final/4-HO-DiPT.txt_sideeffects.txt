The effects of 4-HO-DiPT are broadly comparable to those of other serotonergic psychedelics such as [[LSD]] and [[psilocybin]], but they are distinguished by their relative brevity. [[Alexander Shulgin|Shulgin]] "doubt[s] that there is another psychedelic drug, anywhere, that can match this one for speed, for intensity, for brevity, and sensitive to dose, at least one that is active orally." An idiosyncratic effect of the drug, also noted by Shulgin, is its tendency to induce tremors.<ref>{{CiteTiHKAL}}</ref><ref>[https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_ho_dipt/4_ho_dipt.shtml Entry at Erowid]</ref><ref>[https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal17.shtml Tihkal 4-HO-DIPT entry]</ref>

 


 
Some users have reported a minor audio distortion with lower dosages. Higher dosages increase the polarity of the distortion. It is defined as being slightly lower in pitch and creating several different effects, such as pitch bend, volume distortion, and rate distortion. As with most [[DiPT]] psychedelics, music can become more dissonant and less harmonious. Users have also reported a visual distortion widely comparable to the hallucinogen [[LSD]].
