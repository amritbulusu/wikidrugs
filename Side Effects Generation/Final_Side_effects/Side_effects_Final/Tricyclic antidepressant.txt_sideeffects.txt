Many [[adverse effect|side effects]] may be related to the [[antimuscarinic]] properties of the TCAs. Such side effects are relatively common and may include dry mouth, dry nose, blurry vision, lowered gastrointestinal motility or constipation, urinary retention, cognitive and/or memory impairment, and increased body temperature.

 


 
Other side effects may include drowsiness, anxiety, emotional blunting (apathy/[[anhedonia]]), confusion, restlessness, dizziness, [[akathisia]], [[hypersensitivity]], changes in appetite and weight, sweating, [[sexual dysfunction]], muscle twitches, weakness, nausea and vomiting, [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], and rarely, [[arrythmia|irregular heart rhythms]]. Twitching, hallucinations, delirium and coma are also some of the toxic effects caused by overdose.<ref>Gelder, M, Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. Psychiatry. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp243.</ref> Rhabdomyolysis or muscle breakdown has been rarely reported with this class of drugs as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chabria SB |title=Rhabdomyolysis: a manifestation of cyclobenzaprine toxicity |journal=J Occup Med Toxicol|volume=1|issue= |pages=16 |year=2006 |pmid=16846511 |pmc=1540431 |doi=10.1186/1745-6673-1-16 |url=}}</ref>

 


 
Tolerance to these adverse effects of these drugs often develops if treatment is continued. Side effects may also be less troublesome if treatment is initiated with low doses and then gradually increased, although this may also delay the beneficial effects.

 


 
TCAs can behave like class [[Antiarrhythmic agent|1A antiarrhythmics]], as such, they can theoretically terminate ventricular fibrillation, decrease cardiac contractility and increase collateral blood circulation to ischemic heart muscle. Naturally, in overdose, they can be cardiotoxic, prolonging heart rhythms and increasing myocardial irritability.

 


 
New research has also revealed compelling evidence of a link between long-term use of anticholinergic medications like TCAs and [[dementia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Shelly L.|last2=Anderson|first2=Melissa L.|last3=Dublin|first3=Sascha|last4=Hanlon|first4=Joseph T.|last5=Hubbard|first5=Rebecca|last6=Walker|first6=Rod|last7=Yu|first7=Onchee|last8=Crane|first8=Paul K.|last9=Larson|first9=Eric B.|title=Cumulative Use of Strong Anticholinergics and Incident Dementia|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|date=1 March 2015|volume=175|issue=3|pages=401â€“7|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.7663|pmid=25621434|pmc=4358759}}</ref> Although many studies have investigated this link, this was the first study to use a long-term approach (over seven years) to find that dementias associated with anticholinergics may not be reversible even years after drug use stops.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strong Link Found Between Dementia, Common Anticholinergic Drugs|url=http://www.dddmag.com/articles/2015/04/strong-link-found-between-dementia-common-anticholinergic-drugs|website=Drug Discovery & Development}}</ref> Anticholinergic drugs block the action of [[acetylcholine]], which transmits messages in the nervous system. In the brain, acetylcholine is involved in learning and memory.
