It can also be very nauseating while coming up, some users report a period of restlessness during the come up and feeling cold.  There have been no reported deaths from 2C-T-2, unlike 2C-T-7, and the psychedelic effects have been much milder. The onset usually starts after an hour of ingestion and rises for about two hours until the user hits the plateau. Insufflated doses reach a peak much faster and have been compared to the effect of [[ketamine]] on the body.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

 


 
[[Hallucinations]] similar to those created by [[LSD]] and other [[serotonergic psychedelic]]s are very prominent on typical 2C-T-2 doses. The trip is often described as being similar to LSD due to the serotonergic effects and hallucinations. Some users describe "beautiful" visuals, similar to 2C-T-7, which has coined its street name "Rosy". In some aspects the effect is similar to other [[phenethylamines]] like [[MDMA]] (users sometimes have [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] rushes); however, unlike MDMA, 2C-T-2 is a strong psychedelic, and its effects can be unpredictable, even for "experienced" users.

 


 
2C-T-2 can be just as powerful as LSD and other hallucinogens. Due to the particular body load effect of this substance, it is significantly different from most popular hallucinogens though it is still capable of producing a [[bad trip]]. Effects can last up to 16 hours from dosing.

 


 
When insufflated, 2C-T-2 can give rise to an instant come-up that is intense and possibly nauseating, with intense visuals manifesting within approximately 2 minutes. Common effects include waves of euphoria, laughing fits, and geometric patterns through to full-on hallucinations, lasting roughly 5â€“6 hours.
