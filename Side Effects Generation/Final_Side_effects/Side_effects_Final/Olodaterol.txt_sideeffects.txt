Adverse effects generally were rare and mild in clinical studies. Most common, but still affecting no more than 1% of patients, were [[Common cold|nasopharyngitis (running nose)]], [[dizziness]] and [[rash]]. To judge from the drug's mechanism of action and from experiences with related drugs, [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), [[tachycardia]] (fast heartbeat), [[hypokalemia]] (low blood levels of [[potassium]]), [[Tremor|shaking]], etc., might occur in some patients, but these effects have rarely, if at all, been observed in studies.<ref name="UK-leaflet" />
