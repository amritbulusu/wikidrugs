Fentanyl's most common side effects (more than 10 % of patients) include diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, [[somnolence]], confusion, [[asthenia]] (weakness), sweating, and less frequently (3 to 10 % of patients) abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, [[dyspepsia]] (indigestion), [[dyspnoea]] (shortness of breath), [[hypoventilation]], [[apnoea]], and urinary retention. Fentanyl use has also been associated with [[aphasia]].<ref name="urlDrugs@FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products" />

 


 
Despite being a more potent analgesic, fentanyl tends to induce less nausea, as well as less [[histamine]]-mediated itching, than morphine.<ref name="medscape.com" />

The precise reason for sudden respiratory depression is unclear, but there are several hypotheses:

 
* Saturation of the body fat compartment in patients with rapid and profound body fat loss (patients with cancer, cardiac or infection-induced [[cachexia]] can lose 80 % of their body fat).

 
* Early carbon dioxide retention causing cutaneous vasodilatation (releasing more fentanyl), together with acidosis, which reduces protein binding of fentanyl, releasing yet more fentanyl.

 
* Reduced sedation, losing a useful early warning sign of opioid toxicity and resulting in levels closer to respiratory-depressant levels.

 


 
Fentanyl has a [[therapeutic index]] of 270.<ref name="Springer" />
