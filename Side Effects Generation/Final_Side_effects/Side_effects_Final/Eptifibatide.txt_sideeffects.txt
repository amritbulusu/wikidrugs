Patients receiving eptifibatide are typically seriously ill and most of them are concomitantly treated with other drugs known to have the potential to cause significant [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s. Therefore, not all side effects listed as follows may be attributable to eptifibatide treatment alone:

 


 
The major adverse event in the PURSUIT study was severe [[bleeding]]. Bleeding occurred as well at sites of clinical intervention (local sites) as at other sites (systemically) like urogenital bleedings. Sometimes, these events were severe enough to require [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] of blood or plasma concentrates to stop bleeding and counteract [[anemia]]. Severe bleedings occurred in 4.4 and 4.7% of patients respectively depending on the infusion rate (0.5&nbsp;µg/kg/min vs. 0.75&nbsp;µg/kg/min). A few cases of death due to severe bleeding events attributable to drug therapy were reported. No cases of hemorrhagic stroke were seen. Thrombocytopenia of unknown origin (allergic reaction?) was also noticed in 0.2% of patients.

 


 
Additionally, [[hypotension]] was seen frequently (6%). Cardiovascular failure was also frequent (2%) as were serious arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation 1.5%, atrial fibrillation 6%). Severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions occurred in almost 0.2% of patients. These reactions can be life-threatening and may be due to the peptide character of eptifibatide. Other side effects were rare and mild in nature and may not be connected to eptifibatide therapy.
