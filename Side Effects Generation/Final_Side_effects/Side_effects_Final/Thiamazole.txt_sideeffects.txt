It is important to monitor any symptoms of fever or sore throat while taking thiamazole; this could indicate the development of [[agranulocytosis]], an uncommon but severe side effect resulting from a drop in the [[white blood cell]] count (to be specific, [[neutropenia]], a deficiency of [[neutrophils]]).  A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is performed to confirm the suspicion, in which case the drug is discontinued.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fumarola|first1=A|last2=Di Fiore|first2=A|last3=Dainelli|first3=M|last4=Grani|first4=G|last5=Calvanese|first5=A|title=Medical treatment of hyperthyroidism: state of the art.|journal=Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology & Diabetes|date=Nov 2010|volume=118|issue=10|pages=678â€“84|pmid=20496313|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1253420}}</ref>  Administration of recombinant human [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] (rhG-CSF) may increase recovery.
