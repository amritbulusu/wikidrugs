The principal side effect of olanzapine is weight gain, which may be profound in some cases and/or associated with derangement in the blood lipid and blood sugar profiles (see section [[Olanzapine#Metabolic effects|metabolic effects]]). A recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerance of 15 antipsychotic drugs (APDs) found that it had the highest propensity for causing weight gain out of the 15 APD compared with a SMD of 0.74<ref name=Leucht2013/> Extrapyramidal side effects, although potentially serious, are infrequent to rare from olanzapine<ref name="lexicomp">Lexi-Comp Inc. (2010) Lexi-Comp Drug Information Handbook 19th North American Ed. Hudson, OH: Lexi-Comp Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-59195-278-7}}.</ref> but may include tremors and muscle rigidity.

 


 
Several patient groups are at a heightened risk of side effects from olanzapine and antipsychotics in general. Olanzapine may produce non-trivial [[hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]] in people with [[diabetes mellitus]]. Likewise, the elderly are at a greater risk of falls and accidental injury. Young males appear to be at heightened risk of [[dystonia|dystonic]] reactions, although these are relatively rare with olanzapine. Most antipsychotics, including olanzapine, may disrupt the body's natural thermoregulatory systems, thus permitting excursions to dangerous levels when situations (exposure to heat, strenuous exercise) occur.<ref name = TGA>{{cite web|title=PRODUCT INFORMATION OLANZAPINE SANDOZ® 2.5mg/5mg/7.5mg/10mg/15mg/20mg FILM-COATED TABLETS |work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Sandoz Pty Ltd|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=26 November 2013|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2011-PI-02375-3|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Stöllberger C. |author2=Lutz W. |author3=Finsterer J. | year = 2009 | title = Heat-related side-effects of neurological and non-neurological medication may increase heatwave fatalities | url = | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 879–882 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2009.02581.x}}</ref><ref name = DM>{{cite web|title=OLANZAPINE (olanzapine) tablet OLANZAPINE (olanzapine) tablet, orally disintegrating [Prasco Laboratories]|work=DailyMed|publisher=Prasco Laboratories|date=September 2013|accessdate=26 November 2013|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=4464f13c-b9b9-4464-a05e-5b2cdc091fb2}}</ref><ref name = EMC>{{cite web|title=Olanzapine 10 mg tablets - Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)|work=electronic Medicines Compendium|publisher=Aurobindo Pharma - Milpharm Ltd.|date=17 May 2013|accessdate=26 November 2013|url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/27661/SPC/Olanzapine++10+mg+tablets/}}</ref><ref name = MSR>{{cite web|title=Zyprexa, Zyprexa Relprevv (olanzapine) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more|accessdate=26 November 2013|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/zyprexa-relprevv-olanzapine-342979#showall}}</ref>

Olanzapine is used therapeutically to treat serious mental illness. Occasionally it can have the opposite effect and provoke serious [[paradoxical reaction]]s in a small subgroup of people, causing unusual changes in personality, thoughts or behavior; hallucinations and [[suicidal ideation|excessive thoughts about suicide]] have also been linked to olanzapine use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/olanzapine.html |title=Olanzapine |author=Cerner Multum Incorporated |authorlink=Cerner |date=27 September 2011 |publisher=Drugs.com }}</ref>

 


 
Direct glucuronidation and [[cytochrome P450]] mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo.

 
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] requires all atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of developing [[hyperglycemia]] and [[diabetes]], both of which are factors in the [[metabolic syndrome]]. These effects may be related to the drugs' ability to induce weight gain, although there are some reports of metabolic changes in the absence of weight gain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ramankutty G | title = Olanzapine-induced destabilization of diabetes in the absence of weight gain | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 235–6; discussion 236–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11939979 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0447.2002.2c257a.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lambert MT, Copeland LA, Sampson N, Duffy SA | title = New-onset type-2 diabetes associated with atypical antipsychotic medications | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 919–23 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16581171 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.02.007 }}</ref>  Studies have indicated that olanzapine carries a greater risk of causing and exacerbating diabetes than another commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic, Risperidone.

Despite weight gain, a large multi-center randomized [[National Institute of Mental Health]] study found that olanzapine was better at controlling symptoms because patients were more likely to remain on olanzapine than the other drugs.<ref>{{cite news
