When compared to people anticoagulated with warfarin, patients taking dabigatran had fewer life-threatening bleeds, fewer minor and major bleeds, including intracranial bleeds, but the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly higher. Dabigatran capsules contain tartaric acid, which lowers the gastric pH and is required for adequate absorption. The lower pH has previously been associated with [[dyspepsia]]; some hypothesize that this plays a role in the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.<ref>{{cite journal | author=ML Blommel | title=Dabigatran etexilate: A novel oral direct thrombin inhibitor | journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm  | year=2011 | volume = 68 | pages= 1506–19 | pmid=21817082 | doi=10.2146/ajhp100348 | issue=16 | displayauthors=etal  }}</ref>
