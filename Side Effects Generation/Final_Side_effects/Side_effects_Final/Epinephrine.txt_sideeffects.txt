The [[adrenal medulla]] is a minor contributor to total circulating [[catecholamines]] ([[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]] is at a higher concentration in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]]),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizzo V, Memmi M, Moratti R, Melzi d'Eril G, Perucca E | title = Concentrations of L-dopa in plasma and plasma ultrafiltrates | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis | volume = 14 | issue = 8–10 | pages = 1043–6 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8818013 | doi = 10.1016/s0731-7085(96)01753-0 }}</ref> though it contributes over 90% of circulating epinephrine. Little epinephrine is found in other tissues, mostly in scattered [[chromaffin cells]]. Following [[adrenalectomy]], epinephrine disappears below the detection limit in the blood stream.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cryer PE | title = Physiology and pathophysiology of the human sympathoadrenal neuroendocrine system | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 303 | issue = 8 | pages = 436–44 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 6248784 | doi = 10.1056/nejm198008213030806 }}</ref>

 


 
The adrenals contribute about 7% of circulating [[norepinephrine]], most of which is a spill over from [[neurotransmission]] with little activity as a hormone.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cryer PE | title = Isotope-derivative measurements of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine in man | journal = Diabetes | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 1071–82 | date = November 1976 | pmid = 825406 | doi = 10.2337/diab.25.11.1071 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Gerich J, et al.

Pharmacological doses of epinephrine stimulate [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]], [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>2</sub>]], and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>3</sub>]] adrenoceptors of the [[sympathetic nervous system]].

The term "adrenergic" is often misinterpreted in that the main sympathetic neurotransmitter is norepinephrine (noradrenaline), rather than epinephrine, as discovered by [[Ulf von Euler]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Von Euler|first=US|title=A specific sympathomimetic ergone in adrenergic nerve fibres (sympathin) and its relations to adrenaline and nor adrenaline|journal=Acta Physiol Scand|year=1946|volume=12|pages=73–97|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1946.tb00368.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Von Euler US, Hillarp NA | title = Evidence for the presence of noradrenaline in submicroscopic structures of adrenergic axons | journal = Nature | volume = 177 | issue = 4497 | pages = 44–5 | date = January 1956 | pmid = 13288591 | doi = 10.1038/177044b0 | bibcode = 1956Natur.177...44E }}</ref>

 


 
Epinephrine does have a β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor-mediated effect on [[metabolism]] and the [[airway]], there being no direct neural connection from the [[sympathetic ganglia]] to the [[airway]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren J | title = The adrenal medulla and the airway | journal = British Journal of Diseases of the Chest | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 3004549 | doi = 10.1016/0007-0971(86)90002-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Twentyman OP, Disley A, Gribbin HR, Alberti KG, Tattersfield AE | title = Effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on respiratory and metabolic responses to exercise | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 788–93 | date = October 1981 | pmid = 6795164 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richter EA, Galbo H, Christensen NJ | title = Control of exercise-induced muscular glycogenolysis by adrenal medullary hormones in rats | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–6 | date = January 1981 | pmid = 7009527 }}</ref>

 


 
The concept of the adrenal medulla and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] being involved in the flight, fight and fright response was originally proposed by [[Walter Bradford Cannon|Cannon]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Canon|first=WB.|title=Studies on the conditions of activity in endocrine organs xxvii. Evidence that medulliadrenal secretion is not continuous|journal=Am J Physiol|year=1931|volume=98|pages=447–453.}}</ref> But the adrenal medulla, in contrast to the adrenal cortex, is not required for survival. In adrenalectomized patients hemodynamic and metabolic responses to stimuli such as hypoglycemia and exercise remain normal.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cryer PE, Tse TF, Clutter WE, Shah SD | title = Roles of glucagon and epinephrine in hypoglycemic and nonhypoglycemic glucose counterregulation in humans | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 247 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = E198-205 | date = August 1984 | pmid = 6147094 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoelzer DR, Dalsky GP, Schwartz NS, Clutter WE, Shah SD, Holloszy JO, Cryer PE | title = Epinephrine is not critical to prevention of hypoglycemia during exercise in humans | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 251 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = E104-10 | date = July 1986 | pmid = 3524257 }}</ref>
