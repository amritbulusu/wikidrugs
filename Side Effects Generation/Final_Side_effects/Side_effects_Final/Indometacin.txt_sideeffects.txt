In general, adverse effects seen with indometacin are similar to all other NSAIDs. For instance,  indometacin inhibits both [[PTGS1|cyclooxygenase-1]] and [[Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]], it inhibits the production of prostaglandins in the [[stomach]] and [[intestines]], which maintain the [[mucus|mucous lining]] of the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Indometacin, therefore, like other non-selective COX inhibitors can cause [[peptic ulcer]]s. These ulcers can result in serious bleeding and/or perforation requiring hospitalization of the patient.

 


 
To reduce the possibility of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200&nbsp;mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, [[ranitidine]] 150&nbsp;mg at bedtime, or [[omeprazole]] 20&nbsp;mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including [[dyspepsia]], [[heartburn]] and mild [[diarrhea]] are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.

 


 
Many NSAIDs, but particularly indometacin, cause [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] retention by reducing its excretion by the [[kidney]]s. Thus indometacin users have an elevated risk of lithium toxicity. For patients taking lithium (e.g. for treatment of [[clinical depression|depression]] or [[bipolar disorder]]), less toxic NSAIDs such as [[sulindac]] or [[aspirin]] are preferred.

 


 
All NSAIDs, including indometacin, also increase [[renin|plasma renin activity]] and [[aldosterone]] levels, and increase [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] retention. [[Vasopressin]] activity is also enhanced. Together these may lead to:

 


 
* [[Edema]] (swelling due to fluid retention)

 
* [[Hyperkalemia]] (high potassium levels)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Akbarpour F, Afrasiabi A, Vaziri N | title = Severe hyperkalemia caused by indomethacin and potassium supplementation | journal = South Med J | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 756–7 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4002013 | doi = 10.1097/00007611-198506000-00039| last2 = Afrasiabi | last3 = Vaziri }}</ref>

 
* [[Hypernatremia]] (high sodium levels)

 
* [[Hypertension]]

 


 
Elevations of serum [[creatinine]] and more serious renal damage such as acute renal failure, chronic [[nephritis]] and [[nephrotic syndrome]], are also possible. These conditions also often begin with edema and hyperkalemia.

 


 
Paradoxically yet uncommonly, indometacin can cause headache (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including [[angioedema]], sweating, severe [[hypotension]] and [[tachycardia]] as well as acute [[bronchospasm]]), severe or lethal [[hepatitis]] and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and [[photosensitivity]] are also possible side effects.

 


 
The frequency and severity of side effects and the availability of better tolerated alternatives make indometacin today a drug of second choice. Its use in acute [[gout]] attacks and in [[dysmenorrhea]] is well-established because in these indications the duration of treatment is limited to a few days only, therefore serious side effects are not likely to occur.

 


 
People should undergo regular physical examination to detect edema and signs of central nervous side effects. Blood pressure checks will reveal development of hypertension. Periodic serum electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) measurements, complete blood cell counts and assessment of liver enzymes as well as of creatinine (renal function) should be performed. This is particularly important if Indometacin is given together with an [[ACE inhibitor]] or with potassium-sparing [[diuretic]]s, because these combinations can lead to [[hyperkalemia]] and/or serious kidney failure. No examinations are necessary if only the topical preparations (spray or gel) are applied.

 


 
In women who are pregnant, it has been shown that use of this medication can have an effect of the fetal (Baby's) heart possibly resulting in fetal death via premature closing of the [[Ductus arteriosus]]; this is rare.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Enzensberger|first=Christian|last2=Wienhard|first2=Julia|last3=Weichert|first3=Jan|last4=Kawecki|first4=Andreea|last5=Degenhardt|first5=Jan|last6=Vogel|first6=Melanie|last7=Axt-Fliedner|first7=Roland|date=2012-08-01|title=Idiopathic Constriction of the Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Three Cases and Review of the Literature|url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/content/31/8/1285|journal=Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine|language=en|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1285–1291|issn=0278-4297|pmid=22837295}}</ref>
