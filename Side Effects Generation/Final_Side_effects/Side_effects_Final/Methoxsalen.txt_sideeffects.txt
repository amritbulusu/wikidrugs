Patients with [[high blood pressure]] or a history of [[liver]] problems are at risk for inflammation and irreparable damage to both liver and skin.  The eyes must be protected from UVA radiation.  Side effects include [[nausea]], [[headache]]s, [[dizziness]], and in rare cases [[insomnia]]. Methoxsalen has also been classified as an [[IARC Group 1 carcinogen]] (known to cause cancer) but is only cancerous when combined with UVA radiation.<ref>http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/generalinformationaboutcarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens</ref>
