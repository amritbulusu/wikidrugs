Ethchlorvynol was used to treat [[insomnia]], but prescriptions for the drug had fallen significantly by 1990, as other hypnotics that were considered safer (i.e., less likely to result in overdose) became much more common. It is no longer prescribed in the United States due to unavailability, but it is still available in some countries and would still be considered legal to possess and use with a valid prescription.

 


 
Along with expected sedative effects of relaxation and drowsiness, adverse reactions to ethchlorvynol include skin rash, faintness, restlessness and [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]]. Early adjustment side effects may include nausea and vomiting, numbness, blurred vision, stomach pains and temporary dizziness. There are no specific antidotes available for ethchlorvynol, and treatment is supportive with protocols resembling those for the treatment of [[barbiturate overdose]]. Overdose may be marked by a variety of symptoms, including confusion, fever, [[peripheral]] numbness and weakness, reduced coordination and muscle control, slurred speech, reduced heartbeat, respiratory depression, and in extreme overdoses, coma and death.

 


 
As with all [[GABAA receptor]] agonists, Placidyl can be habit forming and extremely physically addictive (with potentially lethal withdrawal resembling [[delirium tremens]] and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]]). After prolonged use, withdrawal symptoms may include convulsions, hallucinations, and [[amnesia]]. As with most hypnotics, Placidyl was indicated for use in the treatment of insomnia for a short period of time (a week or two).  However, it was nonetheless not uncommon for doctors to prescribe Placidyl (and other hypnotics) for extended periods of time, as currently prescribed soporifics are today.

 


 
During the late 1970s, ethchlorvynol was sometimes over-prescribed causing a minor epidemic of persons who quickly became addicted to this powerful drug.  Occasional deaths would occur when addicted persons would try to inject the drug directly into a vein or an artery. Ethchlorvynol is not compatible with [[intravenous injection]] and serious injury (including the loss of limbs due to vascular injury) or death can occur when it is used in this manner.<ref>{{Cite journal
