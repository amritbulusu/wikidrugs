Bortezomib is associated with [[peripheral neuropathy]] in 30% of patients; occasionally, it can be painful.  This can be worse in patients with pre-existing [[neuropathy]]. In addition, [[myelosuppression]] causing [[neutropenia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] can also occur and be dose-limiting. However, these [[side effects]] are usually mild relative to [[bone marrow transplantation]] and other treatment options for patients with advanced disease. Bortezomib is associated with a high rate of [[shingles]],<ref name="pmid15953001">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oakervee HE, Popat R, Curry N | title=PAD combination therapy (PS-341/bortezomib, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) for previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma | journal=Br J Haematol | volume=129 | issue=6 | pages=755–62 | year=2005 | pmid=15953001 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05519.x|display-authors=etal}}</ref> although [[Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] [[acyclovir]] can reduce the risk of this.<ref name="pmid19406726">{{cite journal |author1=Pour L. |author2=Adam Z. |author3=Buresova L. | title=Varicella-zoster virus prophylaxis with low-dose acyclovir in patients with multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib | journal=Clinical Lymphoma & Myeloma | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=151–3 | year=2009 | pmid=19406726 | doi=10.3816/CLM.2009.n.036|display-authors=etal}}</ref>
