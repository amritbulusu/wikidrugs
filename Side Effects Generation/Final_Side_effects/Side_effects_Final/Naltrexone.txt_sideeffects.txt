The most common side effects reported with naltrexone are [[gastrointestinal]] complaints such as [[diarrhea]] and abdominal cramping. These adverse effects are analogous to the symptoms of [[opioid withdrawal]], as the mu receptor blockade will increase GI motility.

 


 
Naltrexone has been reported to cause liver damage (when given at doses higher than recommended).  It carries an FDA boxed warning for this rare side effect.  Due to these reports, some physicians may check liver function tests prior to starting naltrexone, and periodically thereafter.  Concerns for liver toxicity initially arose from a study of non-addicted obese patients receiving 300&nbsp;mg of naltrexone.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3092099 |url=https://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/download67.html |year=1986 |author1=Pfohl |first1=David N. |title=Naltrexone hydrochloride (Trexan): A review of serum transaminase elevations at high dosage |journal=NIDA research monograph |volume=67 |pages=66â€“72 |last2=Allen |first2=John I. |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard L. |last4=Knopman |first4=David S. |last5=Malcolm |first5=Robert J. |last6=Mitchell |first6=James E. |last7=Morley |first7=John E. }}</ref> Subsequent studies have suggested limited toxicity in other patient populations.

 


 
Naltrexone should not be started until several (typically 7-10) days of abstinence from opioids has been achieved.  This is due to the risk of acute opioid withdrawal if naltrexone is taken, as naltrexone will displace most opioids from their receptors.  The time of abstinence may be shorter than 7 days, depending on the half-life of the specific opioid taken.  Some physicians use a naloxone challenge to determine whether an individual has any opioids remaining.  The challenge involves giving a test dose of naloxone and monitoring for opioid withdrawal.  If withdrawal occurs, naltrexone should not be started.<ref name=galanter />
