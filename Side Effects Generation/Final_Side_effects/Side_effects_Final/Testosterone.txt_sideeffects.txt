In general, [[androgens]] such as testosterone promote [[protein synthesis]] and thus growth of tissues with [[androgen receptors]].<ref name="pmid10821325">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheffield-Moore M | title = Androgens and the control of skeletal muscle protein synthesis | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 181â€“6 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10821325 | doi = 10.3109/07853890008998825 }}</ref> Testosterone can be described as having [[virilization|virilising]] and [[anabolism|anabolic]] effects (though these categorical descriptions are somewhat arbitrary, as there is a great deal of mutual overlap between them).<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Androgen Physiology, Pharmacology and Abuse | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279000/ | first = David J | last = Handelsman | name-list-format = vanc | title = Endotext [Internet] | work = WWW.ENDOTEXT.ORG | publisher = MDText.com, Inc | date = January 2013}}</ref>

 
* ''Anabolic effects'' include growth of [[muscle mass]] and strength, increased [[bone density]] and strength, and stimulation of linear growth and [[bone maturation]].

 
* ''Androgenic effects'' include [[Developmental biology|maturation]] of the [[sex organs]], particularly the [[penis]] and the formation of the [[scrotum]] in the fetus, and after birth (usually at [[puberty]]) a deepening of the [[human voice|voice]], growth of [[facial hair]] (such as the [[beard]]) and [[axillary hair|axillary (underarm) hair]]. Many of these fall into the category of male [[secondary sex characteristics]].

 


 
Testosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence. For [[postnatal]] effects in both males and females, these are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone.
