HU-210 promotes [[cell proliferation|proliferation]], but not [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], of cultured embryonic [[hippocampal]] [[Neural stem cell|neural stem]] and [[progenitor cell]]s likely via a sequential activation of [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB<sub>1</sub> receptors]], [[G proteins|G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins]], and [[MAPK/ERK pathway|ERK signaling]]. It was also indicated by this increased [[neural]] growth to entail [[antianxiety]] and [[antidepressant]] effects.<ref name="pmid16224541">{{Cite journal |author= Jiang, W.|title= Cannabinoids promote embryonic and adult hippocampus neurogenesis and produce anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects |journal= The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume= 115 |issue= 11 |pages= 3104–3116 |year= 2005 |pmid= 16224541 |doi= 10.1172/JCI25509 |pmc= 1253627 |display-authors=etal}}

HU-210, alongside other synthetic cannabinoids like [[WIN 55,212-2]] and [[JWH-133]], is implicated in preventing the inflammation caused by [[amyloid beta]] proteins involved in [[Alzheimer's disease]], in addition to preventing cognitive impairment and loss of neuronal markers. This anti-inflammatory action is induced through the activation of [[cannabinoid receptor]]s, which prevents [[microglia]]l activation that elicits the inflammation. In addition, cannabinoids completely abolish neurotoxicity related to microglia activation in rat models.<ref name="pmid15728830">{{Cite journal

HU-210 is a potent [[analgesic]] with many of the same effects as natural THC.
