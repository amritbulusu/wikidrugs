The following [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s were noted under treatment with tirofiban and heparin (and aspirin, if tolerated). Other drugs were used as necessary.

 


 
The major adverse effect is bleeding on local sites of clinical intervention and systemically (regarding parts of the body or the whole body system). Major bleeding has occurred in 1.4% of patients and minor bleeding in 10.5%. [[Blood transfusion|Transfusion]]s were required to terminate bleeding and to improve bleeding-related [[anemia]] in 4.0% of all patients. Geriatric patients have experienced more bleeding episodes than younger, women more than men.

 


 
Thrombocytopenia was more often seen in the tirofiban + heparin group (1.5%) than in the heparin control group (0.8%). This adverse effect was usually readily reversible within days.

 


 
Positive fecal and urine hemoglobin tests have also been reported.

 


 
[[Postmarketing surveillance|Post-marketing event]]s have been the occurrence of intracranial bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding, [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] and spinal-epidural hematoma. Fatal bleedings have been reported rarely.

 


 
Sometimes, thrombocytopenia was associated with [[chills]], low-grade [[fever]] or bleeding complications (see above).

 


 
Cases of hypersenitivity including acute [[anaphylaxis]] have been seen.
