Agomelatine does not alter daytime [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] and [[memory]] in healthy volunteers. In depressed patients, treatment with the drug increased [[Slow-wave sleep|slow wave]] sleep without modification of REM ([[Rapid eye movement sleep|Rapid Eye Movement]]) sleep amount or REM latency. Agomelatine also induced an advance of the time of sleep onset and of minimum heart rate. From the first week of treatment, onset of sleep and the quality of sleep were significantly improved without daytime clumsiness as assessed by patients.<ref name = PI/><ref name ="emea" />

 


 
Agomelatine appears to cause fewer [[SSRI#Sexual dysfunction|sexual side effects]] and [[discontinuation]] effects than paroxetine.<ref name = PI/> It appears better tolerated than the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]].<ref name = Pool />
