A structural analog of flunoxaprofen is [[benoxaprofen]]. The two drugs are carboxylic acid analogs that form reactive acyl glucurnonides. Benoxaprofen  has been shown to be involved in rare hepatotoxicity. Because of this, benoxaprofen has been removed from the market. In response to this the clinical use of flunoxaprofen has also stopped, even though studies have shown that flunoxaprofen is less toxic than benoxaprofen.

 


 
The toxicity of these [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s may be related to the covalent modification of proteins in response to the drugs' reactive acyl glucuronides. The reactivity of the acyl glucoronides can affect the protein binding.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dong JQ, Liu J, Smith PC |title=Role of benoxaprofen and flunoxaprofen acyl glucuronides in covalent binding to rat plasma and liver proteins in vivo |journal=[[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=937â€“48 |year=2005 |pmid=16046212 |doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2005.05.026}}</ref>
