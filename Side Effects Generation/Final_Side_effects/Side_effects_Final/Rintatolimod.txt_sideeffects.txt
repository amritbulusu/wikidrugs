An independent review of rintatolimod trials in chronic fatigue syndrome was published in the December 2006 issue of the Journal of Clinical Virology.<ref>http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(06)70079-8/abstract</ref> It concluded that Ampligen has been "generally well tolerated", with a "low incidence of clinical toxicity", particularly when compared with the toxicity of the diseases it is used to treat. "No serious safety issues have resulted from the administration of ~75,000 doses IV (most commonly 400&nbsp;mg) twice weekly for up to one year periods or greater. Animal toxicity studies support this observation in humans, with primates demonstrating the greatest margin of safety."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mitchell | first = W. | title = Review of Ampligen clinical trials in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Virology | volume = 37, supp. 1 | pages = S113 |date=December 2006 | url = http://www.immunesupport.com/library/showarticle.cfm/id/7638/searchtext/ampligen | accessdate = 2007-02-26 | doi = 10.1016/S1386-6532(06)70079-8 }}</ref> A mild [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] reaction has occurred in about 15% of patients, and more rarely reported [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] include [[chills]], [[fever]], [[malaise]], [[leukopenia]], [[neutropenia]] and [[leukocytosis]].

According to Hemispherx and patient testimonials, side-effects, when they occur, usually subside within three to four months or less.<ref>[http://chronicfatigue.about.com/od/treatingfmscfs/p/ampligen.htm "Ampligen: Adrienne Dellwo (Updated 2014)"]</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM166046.pdf "FDA Letter Section: Abstracts of Patient Session on Ampligen (1998)"]</ref>
