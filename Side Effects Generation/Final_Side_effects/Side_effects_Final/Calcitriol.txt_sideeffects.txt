The main [[adverse drug reaction]] associated with calcitriol therapy is [[hypercalcemia]] â€“ early symptoms include: [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[constipation]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[apathy]], [[headache]], [[thirst]], [[pruritus]], [[sweating]], and/or [[polyuria]].

However, such episodes may be shorter and easier to treat due to its relatively short [[elimination half-life|half-life]].<ref name="AMH2006" />
