{{See also|List of adverse effects of trazodone}}

 


 
Because of its lack of [[anticholinergic]] side effects, trazodone is especially useful in situations in which [[antimuscarinic]] effects are particularly problematic (e.g., in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, closed-angle glaucoma, or severe constipation). Trazodone's propensity to cause sedation is a dual-edged sword. For many patients, the relief from agitation, anxiety, and insomnia can be rapid; for other patients, including those individuals with considerable [[psychomotor retardation]] and feelings of low energy, therapeutic doses of trazodone may not be tolerable because of sedation. Trazodone elicits [[orthostatic hypotension]] in some patients, probably as a consequence of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor blockade. Mania has been observed in association with trazodone treatment, including in patients with bipolar disorder, as well as in patients with previous diagnoses of major depression.

 
Compared to the reversible MAOI antidepressant drug [[moclobemide]], significantly more impairment of vigilance occurs with trazodone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wesnes |first1=KA |last2= Simpson |first2= PM |last3=Christmas |first3=L |last4=Anand |first4=R |last5=McClelland|first5=GR |year=1989 |title=The effects of moclobemide on cognition |journal=J.
