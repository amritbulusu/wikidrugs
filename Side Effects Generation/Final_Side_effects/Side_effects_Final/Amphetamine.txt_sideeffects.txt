Acute amphetamine administration in humans increases [[endogenous opioid]] release in several brain structures in the [[reward system]].<ref name="Amphetamine-induced endogenous opioid release review" /><ref name="Opioids" /><ref name="Opioids cited primary source" /> Extracellular levels of [[Glutamate (neurotransmitter)|glutamate]], the primary [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] in the brain, have been shown to increase in the striatum following exposure to amphetamine.<ref name="EAAT3" /> This increase in extracellular glutamate presumably occurs via the amphetamine-induced internalization of [[EAAT3]], a glutamate reuptake transporter, in dopamine neurons.<ref name="EAAT3" /><ref name="SLC1A1" /> Amphetamine also induces the selective release of [[histamine]] from [[mast cell]]s and efflux from [[Tuberomammillary nucleus|histaminergic neurons]] through {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.<ref name="E Weihe" /> Acute amphetamine administration can also increase [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] and [[corticosteroid]] levels in [[blood plasma]] by stimulating the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]].<ref name="Evekeo" /><ref name="Human amph effects">{{cite book | author=Gunne LM | title=Drug Addiction II: Amphetamine, Psychotogen, and Marihuana Dependence | date=2013 | publisher=Springer | location=Berlin, Germany; Heidelberg, Germany | isbn=9783642667091 | pages=247–260 | accessdate=4 December 2015 | chapter=Effects of Amphetamines in Humans | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb_uCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name="Primary: Human HPA axis">{{cite journal | vauthors = Oswald LM, Wong DF, McCaul M, Zhou Y, Kuwabara H, Choi L, Brasic J, Wand GS | title = Relationships among ventral striatal dopamine release, cortisol secretion, and subjective responses to amphetamine | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 821–832 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15702139 | doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1300667 | quote = Findings from several prior investigations have shown that plasma levels of glucocorticoids and ACTH are increased by acute administration of AMPH in both rodents and humans}}</ref>
