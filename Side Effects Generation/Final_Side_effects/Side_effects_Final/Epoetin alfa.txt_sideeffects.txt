Common side effects include high blood pressure, headache, disabling cluster migraine (resistant to remedies), joint pain, and clotting at the injection site. Rare cases of stinging at the injection site, skin rash, and [[flu-like symptoms]] (joint and muscle pain) have occurred within a few hours following administration. More serious side effects, including allergic reactions, seizures and thrombotic events (e.g., heart attacks, strokes, and pulmonary embolism) rarely occur. Chronic self-administration of the drug has been shown to cause increases in blood [[hemoglobin]] and [[hematocrit]] to abnormally high levels, resulting in [[dyspnea]] and abdominal pain.<ref>R.

Erythropoietin is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular complications in patients with kidney disease if it is used to target an increase of [[hemoglobin]] levels above 13.0 g/dl.<ref name="pmid17108342">{{cite journal |vauthors=Drüeke TB, Locatelli F, Clyne N, Eckardt KU, Macdougall IC, Tsakiris D, Burger HU, Scherhag A |title=Normalization of hemoglobin level in patients with chronic kidney disease and anemia |journal=N.

Early treatment (before an infant is 8 days old) with erythropoietin correlated with an increase in the risk of [[retinopathy of prematurity]] in premature and anemic infants, raising concern that the angiogenic actions of erythropoietin may exacerbate retinopathy.<ref name=Ohlsson2014>{{Cite journal|last=Ohlsson|first=Arne|last2=Aher|first2=Sanjay M.|date=2014-04-26|title=Early erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=4|pages=CD004863|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004863.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=24771408|via=}}</ref><ref name=Aher2012>{{Cite journal|last=Aher|first=Sanjay M.|last2=Ohlsson|first2=Arne|date=2012-10-17|title=Early versus late erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD004865|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004865.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23076909|via=}}</ref> Since anemia itself increases the risk of retinopathy, the correlation with erythropoietin treatment may be incidental.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
