Sulfonamides have the potential to cause a variety of untoward reactions, including urinary tract disorders, haemopoietic disorders, [[porphyria]], and hypersensitivity reactions. When used in large doses, they may cause a strong allergic reaction. Two of the most serious are [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (also known as Lyell syndrome).<ref name="allergies.about.com"/>

 


 
Approximately 3% of the general population have adverse reactions when treated with sulfonamide antimicrobials. Of note is the observation that patients with HIV have a much higher prevalence, at about 60%.<ref name=SMJ>{{cite journal | author = Tilles SA | title = Practical issues in the management of hypersensitivity reactions: sulfonamides | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 94 | issue = 8 | pages = 817–24 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11549195 | doi = 10.1097/00007611-200108000-00013 }}</ref>

 


 
Hypersensitivity reactions are less common in nonantibiotic sulfonamides, and, though controversial, the available evidence suggests those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics do not have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to the nonantibiotic agents.<ref name=Immun>{{cite journal |vauthors=Slatore CG, Tilles SA | title = Sulfonamide hypersensitivity | journal = Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 477–490, vii | year = 2004 | pmid = 15242722 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.iac.2004.03.011 }}</ref> A key component to the allergic response to sulfonamide antibiotics is the arylamine group at N4, found in sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, sulfadiazine, and the anti-retrovirals amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine sulfonamides do not cross-react to sulfonamides that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine sulfonamides.<ref name=Knowles>{{cite journal |vauthors=Knowles S, Shapiro L, Shear NH | title = Should Celecoxib Be Contraindicated in Patients Who Are Allergic to Sulfonamides? | journal = Drug Safety | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 239–247 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11330653 | pmc =  | doi = 10.2165/00002018-200124040-00001 }}</ref> It has therefore been argued that the terms 'sulfonamide allergy' or 'sulfa allergy' are misleading, and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g. 'cotrimoxazole allergy').<ref name=WAMSG>{{cite web

Two regions of the sulfonamide antibiotic chemical structure are implicated in the hypersensitivity reactions associated with the class.

 


 
* The first is the N1 heterocyclic ring, which causes a type I [[hypersensitivity]] reaction.

 
* The second is the N4 amino nitrogen that, in a stereospecific process, forms reactive metabolites that cause either direct cytotoxicity or immunologic response.

 


 
The nonantibiotic sulfonamides lack both of these structures.<ref name=Cross>{{cite journal | vauthors=Brackett CC, Singh H, Block JH | title = Likelihood and mechanisms of cross-allergenicity between sulfonamide antibiotics and other drugs containing a sulfonamide functional group | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 856–70 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15303450 | doi = 10.1592/phco.24.9.856.36106}}</ref>

 


 
The most common manifestations of a [[hypersensitivity]] reaction to sulfa drugs are [[rash]] and [[hives]]. However, there are several life-threatening manifestations of hypersensitivity to sulfa drugs, including [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], fulminant hepatic necrosis, and [[acute pancreatitis]], among others.<ref name="Harrison's">
