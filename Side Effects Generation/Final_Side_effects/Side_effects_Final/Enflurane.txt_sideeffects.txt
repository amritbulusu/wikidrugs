Clinically, enflurane produces a dose-related depression of [[myocardial]] [[contractility]] with an associated decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. Between 2% and 5% of the inhaled dose is oxidised in the liver, producing [[fluoride]] ions and difluoromethoxy-difluoroacetic acid. This is significantly higher than the metabolism of its structural isomer [[isoflurane]].

 


 
Enflurane also lowers the threshold for [[seizures]], and should especially not be used on people with [[epilepsy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thinklab.com/discussion/prediction-in-epilepsy/224#6|title=Enflurane has established ictogenic properties?|last=|first=|date=April 2004|website=Thinklab|publisher=|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>  Like all potent inhalation anaesthetic agents it is a known trigger of [[malignant hyperthermia]].

 


 
Like the other potent inhalation agents it relaxes the uterus in pregnant women which is associated with more blood loss at delivery or other procedures on the gravid uterus.

 


 
The obsolete (as an anaesthetic) agent [[methoxyflurane]] had a nephrotoxic effect and caused acute renal failure, usually attributed to the liberation of fluoride ions from its metabolism.  Enflurane is similarly metabolised but the liberation of fluoride results in a lower plasma level and enflurane related renal failure seemed unusual if seen at all.<ref>By G. Edward Morgan, Maged S.
