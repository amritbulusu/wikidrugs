A significant side effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia.  A meta-analysis of clinical trials published in July 2012 found 39 to 47.9 events of hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose <56&nbsp;mg/dL) per patient year, with higher rates in the more concentrated degludec formulation.  Rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia ranged from 3.7 to 5.1 events per patient year.<ref name="systematicrev"/>
