The effects of Benoxaprofen on animals were tested in a series of experiments.<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" /><ref name="Knights">Knights, K.M. Cassidy, M.R. Drew, R. (1986). Benoxaprofen induced toxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes. Toxicology, Vol.40, p.327-339</ref> Benoxaprofen had a considerably anti-inflammatory, analgesic and also anti-pyretic activity in those tests.<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" /> In all six animals tested, which included rats, dogs, rhesus monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice, the drug was well absorbed orally. In three of the six species benoxaprofen was then effectively taken up from the gastrointestinal tract (after oral doses of 1â€“10&nbsp;mg/kg).<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" /> The plasma half life was found to be different, being less than 13 hours in the dog, rabbit and monkey, it was notable longer in mice. Furthermore, there were species differences found in the rate and route of excretion of the compound. Whereas benoxaprofen was excreted into the urine by the rabbit and guinea pig, biliary excretion was the way of clearance found in rats and dogs. In all species only unchanged benoxaprofen was found in the plasma mostly extensively bound to proteins.<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" />

 


 
The excretion of the unchanged compound into the bile did occur more slowly in rats. This is interpreted by the authors as evidence that no enterohepatic circulation takes place.<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" /> Another research in rats showed that the plasma membrane of hepatocytes begun to form blebs after administration of benoxaprofen. This is suggested to be due to disturbances in the calcium concentration which is possibly a result of an altered cellular redox state which can have an effect on mitochondrial function and therefore cause disturbances in the calcium concentration.<ref name="Knights" /> In none of the species significant levels of metabolism of benoxaprofen were found to have happened. Only in dogs glucuronide could be found in the bile which is a sure sign of metabolism in that species. Also no differences in distribution of the compound in normal and pregnant rats were found. It was shown in rats that benoxaprofen was distributed into the foetus but with a notable lower concentration than in the maternal tissue.<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" />
