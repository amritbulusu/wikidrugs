MDPV acts as a stimulant and has been reported to produce effects similar to those of [[cocaine]], [[methylphenidate]], and [[amphetamine]]s.<ref name="DEA MDPV report" />

 


 
The primary psychological effects have a duration of roughly 3 to 4 hours, with after effects such as [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], and mild stimulation lasting from 6 to 8 hours.<ref name="DEA MDPV report" /> High doses have been observed to cause intense, prolonged [[panic attack]]s in stimulant-intolerant users,<ref name="DEA MDPV report" /> and there are anecdotal reports of [[psychosis]] from sleep withdrawal and [[drug addiction|addiction]] at higher doses or more frequent dosing intervals.<ref name="DEA MDPV report" /> It has also been repeatedly noted for inducing irresistible [[Craving (withdrawal)|cravings]] to re-administer.<ref name="DEA MDPV report">{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/mdpv.pdf | title=Report on MDPV | work=Drugs of Concern |publisher=DEA | date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name="ACMD: Consideration of the cathinones">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/119173/acmd-cathinodes-report-2010.pdf | title=Consideration of the Cathinones | publisher=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs | date=31 March 2010}}</ref>

Although there is no experience about the long-term effects of MDPV in humans, its has been reported that mice treated with MDPV during adolescence show reinforcing behavior patterns to cocaine which are higher than the control group. Also, these behavioural changes are related to alterations of factor expression directly related to addiction. All this suggests an increased vulnerability to cocaine abuse<ref>{{cite journal|last1=López-Arnau|first1=R|last2=Luján|first2=MA|last3=Duart-Castells|first3=L|last4=Pubill|first4=D|last5=Camarasa|first5=J|last6=Valverde|first6=O|last7=Escubedo|first7=E|title=Exposure of mice to MDPV during adolescence increases the psychostimulant, rewarding and reinforcing effects of cocaine in adulthood|journal=Br.
