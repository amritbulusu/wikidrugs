In a trial for major depressive disorder (MDD), the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events among duloxetine-treated patients were [[nausea]] (34.7%), [[dry mouth]] (22.7%), [[headache]] (20.0%) and [[dizziness]] (18.7%), and except for [[headache]], these were reported significantly more often than in the placebo group.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Perahia DG, Kajdasz DK, Walker DJ, Raskin J, Tylee A |title=Duloxetine 60 mg once daily in the treatment of milder major depressive disorder |journal=Int.

[[Sexual dysfunction]] is often a side effect of drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and [[anorgasmia]] (trouble achieving orgasm). Loss of or decreased response to sexual stimuli and ejaculatory [[anhedonia]] are also possible. Frequency of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction in long-term treatment has been found to be similar for duloxetine and SSRIs when compared in clinical trials,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Duenas|first=H|author2=Brnabic, Lee, Montejo, Prakash, Casimiro-Querubin, Khaled, Dossenbach, Raskin|title=Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction with SSRIs and duloxetine: efferctiveness and functional outcomes over a 6-month observational period|journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice|date=Nov 2011|volume=15|issue=4|pages=242–254|doi=10.3109/13651501.2011.590209|pmid=22121997}}</ref><ref name="Clayton 917–929">{{cite journal|last=Clayton|first=A|author2=Kornstein, Prakash, Mallinckrodt, Wohlreich|title=Changes in sexual functioning associated with duloxetine, escitalopram, and placebo in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=July 2007|volume=4|pages=917–929|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00520.x|pmid=17627739|issue=4 Pt 1}}</ref>  while there is some evidence that duloxetine is associated with less sexual dysfunction than escitalopram when measured at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.<ref name="Clayton 917–929"/>
