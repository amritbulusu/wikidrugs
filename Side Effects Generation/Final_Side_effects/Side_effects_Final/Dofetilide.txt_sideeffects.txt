[[Torsades de pointes]] is the most serious side effect of dofetilide therapy.  The incidence of torsades de pointes is 0.3-10.5% and is dose-related, with increased incidence associated with higher doses.

 


 
The risk of inducing torsades de pointes can be decreased by taking precautions when initiating therapy, such as hospitalizing individuals for a minimum of three days for serial [[creatinine]] measurement, continuous [[telemetry]] monitoring and availability of cardiac resuscitation.
