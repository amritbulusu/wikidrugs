 
Adverse effects of hydromorphone are similar to those of other potent opioid analgesics, such as [[morphine]] and [[heroin]]. The major hazards of hydromorphone include dose-related [[respiratory depression]], urinary retention, bronchospasm and sometimes circulatory depression.<ref name="rxlist.com">[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/hydromorphone_ad.htm Hydromorphone Monograph] (Side Effects & Drug Interactions)</ref> More common [[adverse effect|side effects]] include [[lightheadedness]], [[dizziness]], [[sedation]], [[itch]]ing, [[constipation]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], [[perspiration]], and [[hallucination]]s.<ref name="rxlist.com" /> These symptoms are common in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.

 


 
Simultaneous use of hydromorphone with other opioids, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, sedatives, and general anesthetics can cause a significant increase in respiratory depression, progressing to coma or death. Taking [[benzodiazepine]]s (such as [[diazepam]]) in conjunction with hydromorphone may increase side effects such as dizziness and difficulty concentrating.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/dilaudid-with-valium-1294-768-862-441.html |title = Drug interactions between Dilaudid and Valium |accessdate = 19 November 2014 }}</ref> If simultaneous use of these drugs is required, dose adjustment can be done.<ref name="app.purduepharma.com">{{Cite web |title = Dilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride) Oral LiquidDilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride) Tablets |url = http://app.purduepharma.com/xmlpublishing/pi.aspx?id=dt |website = app.purduepharma.com |accessdate = 5 November 2015 }}</ref>

 


 
A particular problem that may occur with hydromorphone is accidental administration in place of morphine due to a mix-up between the similar names, either at the time the prescription is written or when the drug is dispensed. This has led to several deaths and calls for hydromorphone to be distributed in distinctly different packaging from morphine to avoid confusion.<ref name="pmid1377371">{{cite journal |last = Cohen |first = MR |title = Doctor was thinking of the wrong drug |journal = Nursing |volume = 22 |issue = 6 |page = 25 |date = June 1992 |pmid = 1377371 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16308048">{{cite journal |last1 = Tuohy |first1 = N |last2 = Paparella |first2 = S |title = Look-alike and sound-alike drugs: errors just waiting to happen |journal = J Emerg Nurs |volume = 31 |issue = 6 |pages = 569â€“71 |date = December 2005 |pmid = 16308048 |doi = 10.1016/j.jen.2005.07.012 }}</ref>

 


 
Massive overdoses are rarely observed in opioid-tolerant individuals, but when they occur, they may lead to circulatory system collapse. Symptoms of overdose include respiratory depression, drowsiness leading to coma and sometimes to death, drooping of skeletal muscles, low heart rate and decreasing blood pressure. At the hospital, individuals with hydromorphone overdose are provided supportive care such as assisted ventilation to provide oxygen, gut decontamination using activated charcoal through a nasogastric tube. Opioid antagonist such as naloxone can also be administered concurrent with oxygen supplementation. Naloxone works by reversing the effects of hydromorphone. It is only administered in the presence of significant respiratory depression and circulatory depression.<ref name="app.purduepharma.com" />

 


 
The effects of overdose can be exacerbated by [[dose dumping]] if the medication is taken with [[Ethanol|alcohol]].<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20050714/palladone-pain-drug-pulled-off-market Palladone Pain Drug Pulled Off the Market].</ref>

 


 
Sugar cravings associated with hydromorphone use are the result of a glucose crash after transient hyperglycemia following injection or a less profound lowering of blood sugar over a period of hours, in common with morphine, heroin, codeine, and other opiates.
