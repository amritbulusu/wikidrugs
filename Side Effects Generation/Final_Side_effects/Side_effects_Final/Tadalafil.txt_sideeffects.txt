Tadalafil has been used in approximately 15,000 men participating in clinical trials, and over eight million men worldwide (primarily in the post-approval/post-marketing setting). The most common [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] when using tadalafil are [[headache]], stomach discomfort or pain, indigestion, [[burping]], acid reflux, [[back pain]], [[Myalgia|muscle aches]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], and [[Nasal congestion|stuffy]] or [[Rhinorrhea|runny nose]]. These side effects reflect the ability of PDE5 inhibition to cause vasodilation (cause blood vessels to widen), and usually go away after a few hours. [[Back pain]] and muscle aches can occur 12 to 24 hours after taking the drug, and the symptom usually disappears after 48 hours.

 


 
In May 2005, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] found that tadalafil (along with other PDE5 inhibitors) was associated with vision impairment related to NAION ([[Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy|non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy]]) in certain patients taking these drugs in the post-marketing (outside of clinical trials) setting. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION unrelated to PDE5 use, including: low cup to disc ratio ("crowded disc"), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, [[hyperlipidemia]] and smoking. Given the small number of NAION events with PDE5 use (fewer than one in one million), the large number of users of PDE5 inhibitors (millions) and the fact that this event occurs in a similar population to those who do not take these medicines, the FDA concluded that they were not able to draw a cause and effect relationship, given these patients underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects. However, the label of all three PDE5 inhibitors was changed to alert clinicians to a possible association.

 


 
In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, requires a more prominent warning of the potential risk of [[Hearing impairment|sudden hearing loss]] as the result of postmarketing reports of deafness associated with use of PDE5 inhibitors.<ref name="FDA PDE5">{{cite web | url= http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm| title= FDA Announces Revisions to Labels for Cialis, Levitra and Viagra| author= | date= 2007-10-18| publisher= [[Food and Drug Administration]]| accessdate=2009-09-28 }}</ref>
