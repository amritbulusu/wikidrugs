Most dogs respond well to carprofen use, but like all NSAIDs, it may cause gastrointestinal, liver and kidney problems in some patients.

 


 
After introduction, significant anecdotal reports of sudden animal deaths from its use arose. To date {{when|date=September 2016}}, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has received more than 6,000 adverse reaction reports about the drug (manufactured by [[Pfizer]]). As a result, the FDA requested that Pfizer advise consumers in their advertising that death is a possible side effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm129408.htm|title=Update On Rimadyl, FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, December 1, 1999}}</ref> Pfizer refused and pulled their advertising; however, they now include death as a possible side effect on the drug label. Plans call for a "Dear Doctor" letter to advise veterinarians, and a safety sheet attached to pill packages.

 


 
Adverse effects include:

 
* Loss of appetite

 
* Vomiting

 
* Diarrhea

 
* Increase in thirst

 
* Increase in urination

* Liver dysfunction: [[jaundice]] (yellowing of eyes)

 
* Blood or dark tar-like material in [[urine]] or [[faeces|stools]]

 
* [[Lethargy]].

* Change in [[skin]] (redness, scabs, or scratching)

 
* Change in behavior (such as decreased or increased activity level, [[seizure]] or aggression).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rimadyl.com/display.aspx?drug=RC&species=CN&sec=610| title=Dog Owner Information About Rimadyl (carprofen)|date=|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref>

Carprofen should not be administered concurrently with steroids, as this can cause ulcers in the stomach. Dogs should be taken off carprofen for three full days before ingesting a steroid (such as [[prednisolone]]). Carprofen should not be given at the same time with other types of medications such as other [[NSAID]]s ([[aspirin]], [[etodolac]], [[deracoxib]], [[meloxicam]], [[tepoxalin]]) or [[steroids]] such as [[dexamethasone]], [[triamcinolone]], [[cortisone]] or [[prednisone]].

 


 
Carprofen must be used with caution within the supervision of a veterinarian in dogs with liver or kidney disease, [[dehydration]], bleeding deficits, or other health problems. It is not recommended for use in dogs with bleeding disorders (such as [[Von Willebrand's disease]]), as safety has not been established in dogs with these disorders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetdepot.com/Rimadyl-Carprofen-25mg-60-Caplets.html|title=Rimadyl   (Carprofen)|date=|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref> It has not been established whether carprofen can be safely used in pregnant dogs, dogs used for breeding purposes,  or in lactating female dogs.

 


 
Several laboratory studies and clinical trials have been conducted to establish the safety of using Carprofen. Clinical studies were conducted in nearly 300 dogs, coming from different [[breeds]]. The dogs were treated with Rimadyl at the recommended dose for 2 weeks. According to these studies, the drug was clinically well tolerated and the treated dogs did not have a greater incidence of adverse reactions when compared to the control group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rimadyl.com/account/DisplayPDF?docName=PI.pdf| title=Rimadyl [package insert].

A number of factors that may contribute to the high incidence of adverse reports received for carprofen by the Center for Veterinary Medicine in the late 1990s. These include:

 
* The type of drug;

 
* Wide use;

 
* Duration of use. While the side effects from carprofen are known to occur within a short period of time after administration, it is believed that long-term use may actually result in a higher risk for adverse reactions{{CN|date=January 2017}};

 
* Senior dog use. Older dogs are generally more prone to side effects caused by carprofen.
