Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) associated with mycophenolate therapy include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain; infections, [[leukopenia]], and/or [[anemia]] reflect the immunosuppressive and [[myelosuppressive]] nature of the drug. Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with [[thrombophlebitis]] and [[thrombosis]]. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include [[esophagitis]], [[gastritis]], [[gastrointestinal tract]] [[hemorrhage]], and/or invasive [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) infection.<ref name="AMH2006"/> More rarely, [[pulmonary fibrosis]] or various [[neoplasia]] occur: melanoma, lymphoma, other malignancies having an occurrences of 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, depending on the type, with neoplasia in the skin being the most common site.<ref>http://reference.medscape.com/drug/cellcept-myfortic-mycophenolate-343209#4</ref><ref>http://www.bnf.org</ref> Several cases of [[pure red cell aplasia]] (PRCA) have also been reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm177397.htm |title=CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) August 2009 |date=August 14, 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>

 


 
The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has issued an alert that patients on mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including [[shingles]], other [[herpes]] infections, [[cytomegalovirus]], and [[BK virus]] associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 patients that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a [[JC virus|viral]] infection known as [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]]; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm177397.htm |title=CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) August 2009 |date=August 14, 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>
