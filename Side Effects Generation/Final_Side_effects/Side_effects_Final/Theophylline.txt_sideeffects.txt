The use of theophylline is complicated by its interaction with various drugs and by the fact that it has a narrow [[therapeutic window]]. Its use must be monitored by direct measurement of serum theophylline levels to avoid [[toxicity]].  It can also cause nausea, diarrhea, increase in heart rate, [[arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], and CNS excitation (headaches, [[insomnia]], irritability, [[dizziness]] and [[lightheadedness]]).<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a681006.html MedlinePlus Drug Information: Theophylline<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/theophylline-oral_24_hour_tablet/article.htm THEOPHYLLINE - ORAL 24 HOUR TABLET (Uni-Dur) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Seizures can also occur in severe cases of toxicity, and are considered to be a neurological emergency.<ref name="Yoshikawa-2007">{{cite journal | author = Yoshikawa H | title = First-line therapy for theophylline-associated seizures. | journal = Acta Neurol Scand | volume = 115 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = 57–61 |date=Apr 2007 | pmid = 17362277 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2007.00810.x }}</ref> Its toxicity is increased by [[erythromycin]], cimetidine, and [[fluoroquinolones]], such as [[ciprofloxacin]].
