During the initial phase of the therapy, before GnRH receptors have been significantly down-regulated, [[testosterone]] levels are increased. This can lead to transient tumour activation with bone pain (in patients with metastases) and [[urinary retention]]. Side effects that occur later during the treatment are mainly due to low testosterone levels and include headache, [[hot flashes]], reduced [[libido]], and [[erectile dysfunction]].<ref name="Austria-Codex" />
