Women who take contraceptive pills containing drospirenone have a six- to sevenfold risk of developing [[thromboembolism]] (dangerous blood clots) compared to women who do not take any contraceptive pill, and have twice the risk (some epidemiological studies suggest thrice, according to the FDA) compared to women who take a contraceptive pill containing [[levonorgestrel]], though the actual risk is small, in the neighborhood of 9 to 27 out of 10,000 women on an oral contraceptive for a year (up to 9 for levonorgestrel vs up to 27 for drospirenone, or about 0.09% vs 0.3% per year.)<ref name="Lidegaard 2011">{{cite journal|last1=Lidegaard|first1=Øjvind|last2=Milsom|first2=Ian|last3=Skovlund|first3=Charlotte Wessel|last4=Skjeldestad|first4=Finn Egil|last5=Løkkegaard|first5=Ellen|date=October 25, 2011|title=Risk of venous thromboembolism from use of oral contraceptives containing different progestogens and oestrogen doses: Danish cohort study, 2001–9|journal=BMJ|volume=343|page=d6423|doi=10.1136/bmj.d6423|pmc=3202015|pmid=22027398|url=http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/448051/field_highwire_article_pdf/0/bmj.d6423.full.pdf|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>

 


 
While all oral contraceptives can increase the risk for [[venous thrombosis|venous thrombembolic events]], including fatal blood clots, several studies have reported a greater risk for women taking contraceptives containing drospirenone.  (Before becoming alarmed at the huge "relative" differences in risk, one must remember that the "actual" risks involved are quite small — in the neighborhood of 1 in 10,000 to 27 in 10,000 in a year).<ref name="Lidegaard 2012">{{cite journal|last1=Lidegaard|first1=Øjvind|last2=Milsom|first2=Ian|last3=Geirsson|first3=Reynir Tomas|last4=Skjeldestad|first4=Finn Egil|date=July 2012|title=Hormonal contraception and venous thromboembolism|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|volume=91|issue=7|pages=769–778|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01444.x|pmid=22568831|url=http://www.lidegaard.dk/Publ/12%20Lidegaard%20ACTA.pdf|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}</ref>

 
 

 
When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became concerned about the risks of drospirenone, they funded studies based on the medical records of more than 800,000 women taking oral contraceptives.  They found that the risk of VTE, which includes dangerous and potentially fatal blood clots, was 93% higher for women who had been taking oral contraceptives made with drospirenone for only 3 months or less and 290% higher for women taking drospirenone oral contraceptives for 7–12 months, compared to women taking other types of oral contraceptives.  To determine the exact risk for women of different ages and different circumstances, further study is warranted.<ref name="Dunn 2011">{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Nick|date=April 21, 2011|title=The risk of deep venous thrombosis with oral contraceptives containing drospirenone.

The FDA recently updated the label for contraceptives containing drospirenone to include warnings for stopping use prior to and after surgery, and to warn that contraceptives with drospirenone may have a higher risk of dangerous blood clots.<ref name="Yasmin PI 2012"/>
