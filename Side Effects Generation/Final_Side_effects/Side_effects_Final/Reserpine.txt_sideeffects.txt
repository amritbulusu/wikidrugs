At doses of less than 0.2&nbsp;mg/day, reserpine has few side effects, the most common of which is nasal congestion.<ref name="pmid3350594">{{cite journal |vauthors=Curb JD, Schneider K, Taylor JO, Maxwell M, Shulman N |title=Antihypertensive drug side effects in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program |journal=Hypertension |volume=11 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=II51–5 |year=1988 |pmid=3350594 |doi=10.1161/01.hyp.11.3_pt_2.ii51}}</ref>

 


 
There has been much concern about reserpine causing depression leading to suicide. However, this was reported in uncontrolled studies using doses averaging 0.5&nbsp;mg per day.<ref name="pmid13629798">{{cite journal |vauthors=QUETSCH RM, ACHOR RW, LITIN EM, FAUCETT RL |title=Depressive reactions in hypertensive patients; a comparison of those treated with Rauwolfia and those receiving no specific antihypertensive treatment |journal=Circulation |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=366–75 |year=1959 |pmid=13629798 |doi=10.1161/01.cir.19.3.366}}</ref><ref name="pmid13304797">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemieux G, Davignon A, Genest J |title=Depressive states during Rauwolfia therapy for arterial hypertension; a report of 30 cases |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=522–6 |year=1956 |pmid=13304797 |doi= |pmc=1823144}}</ref>

 


 
Reserpine can cause: nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, gastric intolerance, gastric ulceration (due to increased cholinergic activity in gastric tissue and impaired mucosal quality), stomach cramps and diarrhea are noted. The drug causes hypotension and bradycardia and may worsen asthma. Congested nose and erectile dysfunction are other consequences of alpha-blockade.<ref name="Giannini">AJ Giannini, HR Black.

Depression can occur at any dose and may be severe enough to lead to suicide. Other central effects are a high incidence of drowsiness, dizziness, and nightmares. Parkinsonism occurs in a dose dependent manner. General weakness or fatigue is quite often encountered. 

 


 
High dose studies in rodents found reserpine to cause fibroadenoma of the breast and malignant tumors of the seminal vesicles among others. Early suggestions that reserpine causes breast cancer in women (risk approximately doubled) were not confirmed. It may also cause [[hyperprolactinemia]].<ref name="Giannini"/>
