Overall, 14.5% of patients taking ivabradine experience [[phosphene|luminous phenomena]] (by patients described as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field). This is probably due to blockage of I<sub>''h''</sub> ion channels in the [[retina]], which are very similar to cardiac I<sub>''f''</sub>. These symptoms are mild, transient, and fully reversible. In clinical studies, about 1% of all patients had to discontinue the drug because of these sensations, which occurred on average 40 days after the drug was started.<ref name=Tardif/>

 


 
In a large clinical trial, [[bradycardia]] (unusually slow heart rate) occurred in 2% and 5% of patients taking ivabradine at doses of 7.5 and 10&nbsp;mg respectively (compared to 4.3% in those taking atenolol).<ref name=Tardif/> 2.6–4.8% reported [[headache]]s.<ref name=Tardif/> Other common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (1–10% of patients) include first-degree [[heart block|AV block]], [[Premature ventricular contraction|ventricular extrasystoles]], dizziness and/or blurred vision.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Anonymous | title = New medicines: Procoralan | url = http://www.pjonline.com/Editorial/20060204/products/p131products.html | journal = Pharmaceutical Journal | year = 2006 | volume = 276 | issue = 7386 | pages=131 }}</ref>
