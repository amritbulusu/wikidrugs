The total duration of 2C-E's effects is generally between six and ten hours for an average dose, with the plateau lasting between three and six hours.<ref name="pihkal">{{cite book|last1=Shulgin|first1=Alexander T|last2=Shulgin|first2=Ann|title=PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story|date=1991|publisher=Transform Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0-9630096-0-9|edition=1st ed., 7th printing}}</ref> For such a dose, the onset of effects takes approximately twenty to ninety minutes and perception may be somewhat altered for up to a day after ingestion.<ref name=erowid2ce>{{cite web|last1=Fire|first1=Erowid|last2=Earth|first2=Erowid|title=Erowid 2C-E Vault: Effects|url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ce/2ce_effects.shtml|website=Erowid.org|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref>

 


 
2C-E's effects are often described as "neutral", in comparison with other psychedelic chemicals and even other [[2C (psychedelics)|2C-x]] related molecules. In [[PiHKAL]], Shulgin states:

 
:"Here is another of the magical half-dozen. The range is purposefully broad. At 10 milligrams there have been some pretty rich +++<ref group="nb">Shulgin's +/- rating scale, per ''PiHKAL''. See References below. Quoting: "Plus Three (+++) = Not only are the chronology and the nature of a drug's action quite clear, but ignoring its action is no longer an option. The subject is totally engaged in the experience, for better or worse."</ref> experiences, and yet I have had the report from one young lady of a 30 milligram trial that was very frightening. My first experience with 2C-E was really profound, and it is the substance of a chapter within the story. Several people have said, about 2C-E, "I don't think I like it, since it isn't that much fun. But I intend to explore it again." There is something here that will reward the experimenter. Someday, the full character of 2C-E will be understood, but for the moment, let it rest as being a difficult and worth-while material. A very much worth-while material."

 


 
Adverse effects include [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]],  [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[delirium]], and [[hallucination]]s.<ref name=Topeff>{{Cite journal | author1 = Topeff JM | author2 = Ellsworth H | author3 = Willhite LA | author4 = Bangh SA | author5 = Edwards EM | author6 = Cole JB | title = A case series of symptomatic patients, including one fatality, following 2C-E exposure | journal = Clin Toxicol. | date = 2011 | volume = 49 | pages = 526}}</ref>  At least one death has been attributed to a 2C-E overdose.<ref name=Topeff/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Pham|first1=Sherisse|title=Man Arrested in Mass Drug Overdose That Killed 1 Teen and Left 10 People Hospitalized|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/man-arrested-minnesota-deadly-mass-drug-overdose/story?id=13166375|accessdate=29 June 2014|work=ABC World News|date=18 March 2011}}</ref>
