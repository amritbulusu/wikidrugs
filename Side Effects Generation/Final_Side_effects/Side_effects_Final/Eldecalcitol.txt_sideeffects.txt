Clinical trials have suggested that eldecalcitol, a vitamin D analog, has strong effects to reduce calcium reabsorption into the body from bones, therefore increasing bone mineral density, and to increase calcium absorption in intestines.<ref>{{Cite journal | year = 2013 | last1 = Nogachi | first1 = Y | last2 = Kawate | first2 = H | last3 = Nomura | first3 = M | last4 = Takayanagi | first4 = R | title = Eldecalcitol for the treatment of osteoporosis | volume = 8 | pages = 1313–1321 | doi = 10.2147/CIA.S49825 | journal = Europe PubMed Central}}</ref> In animals, eldecalcitol inhibits the activity of osteoclasts for the function to reduce bone degradation for calcium, while still able to maintain osteoblast function so as to not hinder bone formation.<ref name=cortbone>{{Cite journal | year = 2013 | last1 = Smith | first1 = S | last2 = Doyle | first2 = N | last3 = Boyer | first3 = M | last4 = Chouinard | first4 = L | last5 = Saito | first5 = H | title = Eldecalcitol, a vitamin D analog, reduces bone turnover and increases trabecular an cortical bone mass, density, and strength in ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–122 | journal = Bone| pmid = 23774444 | doi=10.1016/j.bone.2013.06.005}}</ref> Unlike other vitamin D analogs, eldecalcitol does not significantly suppress parathyroid hormone levels, promising a better treatment for osteoporosis in comparison to other medications.<ref>{{Cite journal | year = 2010 | last1 = Harada | first1 = S | last2 = Uno | first2 = S | last3 = Takahashi | first3 = F | last4 = Saito | first4 = H | title = Eldecalcitol is less effective in suppressing parathyroid hormone compared to calcitriol ''in vivo'' | volume = 121 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 281–283 | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology| pmid = 20398764 | doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2010.04.001}}</ref> 

 
Bone mineral density increases with eldecalcitol use, in addition to strengthening bone structure. This occurs due to the function of the eldecalcitol drug, which decreases bone reabsorption as observed through a bone reabsorption marker. Bone geometry assessments show that eldecalcitol increases cortical bone area in patients with osteoporosis more so than other vitamin D analogs, such as alfacalcidol. There was also the maintenance of thickness of cortical bone mass, strongly indicating that eldecalcitol improves the strength and mass of bone, specifically cortical bone structure.<ref>{{Cite journal | year = 2013 | last1 = Nakamura | first1 = T | last2 = Takano | first2 = T | last3 = Fukunaga | first3 = M | last4 = Shiraki | first4 = M | last5 = Matsumoto | first5 = T | title = Eldecalcitol is more effective for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures than alfacalcidol | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–422 | doi = 10.1007/s00774-012-0418-5 | pmid = 23575909 | journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism | pmc=3709079}}</ref> Adverse effects of eldecalcitol include an increase in blood and urinary calcium levels. Abnormally high levels of calcium can lead to problems associated with hypercalcemia.
