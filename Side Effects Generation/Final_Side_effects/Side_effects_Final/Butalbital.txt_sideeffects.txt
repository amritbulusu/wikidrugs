Side effects for any psychoactive drug are difficult to predict, though butalbital is usually well tolerated. Commonly reported side effects for butalbital, which tend to subside with continued use, include:

Rare side-effects include [[Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome]], an adverse reaction to barbiturates, and [[anaphylaxis]].

 


 
The risk and severity of all side effects is greatly increased when butalbital (or butalbital-based medications, such as [[Fioricet]]) are combined with other sedatives (ex. [[ethanol]], [[opiates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[antihistamines]]), and other side effects, which are not typically associated with butalbital, may occur. Inhibitors of the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4 may also increase the risk, severity, and duration of side effects, many drugs inhibit this enzyme as do some foods such as [[grapefruit]] and the [[blood orange]]. Taking butalbital-based medications with some other drugs may also increase the side effects of the other medication.
