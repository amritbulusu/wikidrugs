Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug.<ref name=DURAMED/> Patients may also chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless candy in order to increase the flow of saliva. Some artificial saliva products may give temporary relief.<ref name=DURAMED/> 

 
Men with prostate enlargement who take protriptyline may be especially likely to have problems with urinary retention.<ref name=AHFS/> Symptoms include having difficulty starting a urine flow and more difficulty than usual passing urine.<ref name=AHFS/> In most cases, urinary retention is managed with dose reduction or by switching to another type of antidepressant.<ref name=AHFS/> In extreme cases, patients may require treatment with bethanechol, a drug that reverses this particular side effect.<ref name=AHFS/>

 


 
A common problem with TCAs is [[sedation]] (drowsiness, lack of physical and mental alertness), but protriptyline is considered the least sedating agent among this class of agents.<ref name=Kirchheiner04/> Its side effects are especially noticeable early in therapy.<ref name=Kirchheiner04/> In most people, early TCA side effects decrease or disappear entirely with time, but, until then, patients taking protriptyline should take care to assess which side effects occur in them and should not perform hazardous activities requiring mental acuity or coordination.<ref name=DeVane90>DeVane, C.
