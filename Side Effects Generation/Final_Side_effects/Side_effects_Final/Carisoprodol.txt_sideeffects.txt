The medication is well tolerated and without adverse effects in the majority of patients for whom it is indicated. In some patients, however, and/or early in therapy, carisoprodol can have the full spectrum of sedative side effects and can impair the patient's ability to operate a firearm, motor vehicles, and other machinery of various types, especially when taken with medications containing alcohol, in which case an alternative medication would be considered. The intensity of the side effects of carisoprodol tends to lessen as therapy continues, as is the case with many other drugs.

 


 
The interaction of carisoprodol with essentially all [[opioid]]s, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} those of the codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class ([[codeine]], [[ethylmorphine]], [[dihydrocodeine]], [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]], [[nicocodeine]], [[benzylmorphine]], the various acetylated codeine derivatives including  [[acetyldihydrocodeine]], [[dihydroisocodeine]], [[nicodicodeine]] and others) {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} which allows the use of a smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect, {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is a large part of the problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as [[methadone]], [[levomethadone]], [[ketobemidone]], [[phenadoxone]] and others.  In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from carelessly combining overdoses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirate]] while unconscious.
