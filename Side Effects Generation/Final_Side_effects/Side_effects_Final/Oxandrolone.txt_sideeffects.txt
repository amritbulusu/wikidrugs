Women who are administered oxandrolone may experience [[virilization]], irreversible development of masculine features such as [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[menstrual disturbance|menstruation abnormalities]], [[male-pattern hair loss]], and [[clitoral enlargement]].<ref name="ShortStature2015" /><ref name="UpsherSmithLabel" /><ref name="SasGault2014" /> Oxandrolone may disrupt growth in children, reducing their adult height.<ref name="medline" />{{Better source needed|date=June 2017}} Because of these side effects, doses given to women and children are chosen carefully and patients are usually monitored for virilization and growth abnormalities.<ref name="ShortStature2015" /><ref name="SasGault2014" /> Like other [[androgen]]s, oxandrolone can cause or worsen [[acne]] and [[priapism]] (unwanted or prolonged erections).<ref name="UpsherSmithLabel" /><ref name="medline">{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a604024.html | title=Oxandrolone | publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc. | work=MedlinePlus | date=15 May 2016 | accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref> Oxandrolone can also reduce males' fertility, another side effect common among androgens.<ref name="medline" /> In an attempt to compensate for the exogenous increase in androgens, the body may reduce testosterone production via [[testicular atrophy]] and inhibition of [[gonadotropic]] activity.<ref name="UpsherSmithLabel" />

 


 
Unlike some AAS, oxandrolone does not generally cause [[gynecomastia]] because it is not [[aromatized]] into [[estrogenic]] metabolites.<ref name="CoronaRastrelli2012" /> However, although no reports of gynecomastia were made in spite of widespread use, oxandrolone was reported in a publication in 1991 to have been associated with 33&nbsp;cases of gynecomastia in adolescent boys treated with it for [[short stature]].<ref name="Aronson2009">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey K.

Uniquely among 17α-alkylated AAS, oxandrolone shows little to no [[hepatotoxicity]], even at high doses.<ref name="pmid27372877">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bond P, Llewellyn W, Van Mol P | title = Anabolic androgenic steroid-induced hepatotoxicity | journal = Med.
