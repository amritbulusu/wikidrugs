Over 10% of oral sotalol users experience [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[dizziness]], [[lightheadedness]], [[headache]], [[asthenia|weakness]], [[nausea]], [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[bradycardia]] (slow heart rate), [[palpitation|a sensation of the heart beating too hard, fast, or irregularly]], or [[chest pain]]. Higher doses of sotalol increase the risk for all of these possible side effects.<ref name="fda2009">{{cite web | date = July 2009 | title = Sotalol: Full Prescribing Information | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = 23 April 2015 | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/022306s000lbl.pdf}}</ref>

 


 
In rare cases, the [[QT prolongation]] caused by sotalol can lead to the development of life-threatening [[torsade de pointes]] (TdP) polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Across several [[clinical trial]]s, 0.6% of oral sotalol patients with supraventricular abnormal heart rhythms (such as atrial fibrillation) developed TdP.<ref name="fda2009" /> For patients who had a history of [[sustained ventricular tachycardia]] (abnormal rhythm lasting more than 30 seconds), 4% developed TdP. Risk increases with dosage, female sex, or having a history of an [[cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] or [[congestive heart failure]].<ref name="fda2009" /> The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of TdP for sustained ventricular tachycardia patients was 0% with an 80&nbsp;mg daily dose, 0.5% at 160&nbsp;mg, 1.6% at 320&nbsp;mg, 4.4% at 480&nbsp;mg, 3.7% at 640&nbsp;mg, and 5.8% at doses greater than 640&nbsp;mg.<ref name="fda2009" /> Due to this risk, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires affected individuals to be hospitalized for at least three days in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring upon starting or restarting sotalol.<ref name="fda2009" />
