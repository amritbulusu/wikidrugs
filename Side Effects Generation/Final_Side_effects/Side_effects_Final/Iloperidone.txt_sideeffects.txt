Examination of the safety and tolerability of iloperidone have shown that at a 5&nbsp;mg/day dose in healthy male volunteers, the drug was fairly well tolerated, although [[hypotension]], dizziness, and somnolence were very common side effects ranging from mild to moderate in severity.  A second study showed that co administration of food decreased the severity of these effects. This study also indicated that repeat administration of iloperidone could decrease the effects of hypotension.<ref>{{cite journal

The approved dose is 12–24&nbsp;mg not 5&nbsp;mg. However, claims of better tolerance have been reported.

 


 
In some cases (prevalence unknown), it can greatly increase agitation and aggressivity like all antipsychotics drugs.
