Contraindications for the use of carbetocin include inappropriate timing during labor and delivery (such as before parturition or to induce labor) or allergic reactions to carbetocin or other oxytocin homologues.<ref name="info"/> Additionally, carbetocin should not be used if a patient has high blood pressure or cardiovascular problems. Overdosage or repeated use of carbetocin, particularly if used during pregnancy, could cause hyper-excitation of the oxytocin receptors resulting in excessive and prolonged stimulation of uterine contractions, increasing risk of [[uterine rupture]], [[placental abruption]], fetal respiratory distress and [[postpartum hemorrhage]].<ref name="info"/>
