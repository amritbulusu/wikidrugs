One of the undesirable effects of small-molecule drugs is that they can lack specificity for their target; hence bind to similar targets in other unrelated proteins, which can result in undesirable drug-related side effects. However, pre-clinical studies have shown volasertib binds in a highly selective manner to the kinase domain of the PLK family, without binding to other proteins with a kinase domain. Clinical studies have shown that at the maximum tolerated dose, side effects of volasertib include; [[anaemia]] (22%), [[thrombocytopenia]], [[neutropenia]] and [[febrile neutropenia]].<ref name="fifteen">{{Cite conference
