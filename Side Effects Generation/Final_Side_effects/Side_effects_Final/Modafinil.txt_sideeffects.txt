Rare occurrences have been reported of more serious adverse effects, including severe skin rashes and other symptoms that are probably allergy-related. From the date of initial marketing, December 1998, to January 30, 2007, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] received six cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions associated with modafinil, including [[erythema multiforme]] (EM), [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] (SJS), [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (TEN), and [[DRESS syndrome]], involving adult and pediatric patients. The FDA issued a relevant alert. In the same alert, the FDA also noted that [[angioedema]] and multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in postmarketing experiences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Modafinil (marketed as Provigil): Serious Skin Reactions |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |year=2007 |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/dsn/2007_fall/postmarketing.htm#modafinil}}</ref> In 2007, the FDA ordered Cephalon to modify the Provigil leaflet in bold-face print of several serious and potentially fatal conditions attributed to modafinil use, including TEN, DRESS syndrome, and SJS.
