Hyperprolactinaemia results from antagonism of the [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]] receptors located on the lactotrophic cells found in the [[anterior pituitary gland]]. Amisulpride has a high propensity for elevating plasma [[prolactin]] levels as a result of its poor [[blood-brain barrier]] penetrability and hence the resulting greater ratio of peripheral D<sub>2</sub> occupancy to central D<sub>2</sub> occupancy. This means that to achieve the sufficient occupancy (~60–80%<ref name="GG">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-07-162442-8 | title = [[Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] | edition = 12th |author1=Brunton, L |author2=Chabner, B |author3=Knollman, B | year = 2010 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | location = New York }}</ref>) of the central D<sub>2</sub> receptors in order to elicit its therapeutic effects a dose must be given that is enough to saturate peripheral D<sub>2</sub> receptors including those in the anterior pituitary.<ref name=mckeage>{{cite journal
