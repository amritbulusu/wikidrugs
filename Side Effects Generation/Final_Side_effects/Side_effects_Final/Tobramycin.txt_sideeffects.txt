Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is [[ototoxicity|ototoxic]]: it can cause [[Hearing impairment|hearing loss]], or a loss of [[equilibrioception]], or both in genetically susceptible individuals. These individuals carry a normally harmless genetic mutation that allows aminoglycosides such as tobramycin to affect [[cochlea|cochlear cells]]. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is generally irreversible.

 


 
As with all amino glycosides, tobramycin is also nephrotoxic, it can damage or destroy the tissue of the kidneys [3]. This effect can be particularly worrisome when multiple doses accumulate over the course of a treatment or when the kidney concentrates urine by increasing [[Renal physiology|tubular reabsorption]] during sleep. Adequate hydration may help prevent excess nephrotoxicity and subsequent loss of renal function. For these reasons [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] tobramycin needs to be carefully dosed by [[body weight]], and its serum concentration monitored. Tobramycin is thus said to be a drug with a narrow [[therapeutic index]].
