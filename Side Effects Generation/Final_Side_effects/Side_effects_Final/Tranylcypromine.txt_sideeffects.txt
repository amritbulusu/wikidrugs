Of note, there has not been found to be a correlation between sex and age below 65 regarding incidence of adverse effects.<ref name="pmid28579071"/>

 


 
Tranylcypromine is not associated with [[Weight gain|weight gain]] and has a low risk for hepatotoxicity compared to the [[hydrazine (Antidepressant)|hydrazine]] MAOIs.<ref name="pmid28579071"/><ref name="pmid22110357"/>

 


 
It is generally recommended that MAOIs be discontinued prior to [[anesthesia]]; however, this creates a risk of recurrent depression. In a retrospective observational cohort study, patients on tranylcypromine undergoing general anesthesia had a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension, while there was no difference between patients not taking an MAOI regarding intraoperative incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=van Haelst|first1=IM|last2=van Klei|first2=WA|last3=Doodeman|first3=HJ|last4=Kalkman|first4=CJ|last5=Egberts|first5=TC|last6=MAOI Study|first6=Group.|title=Antidepressive treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the occurrence of intraoperative hemodynamic events: a retrospective observational cohort study.|journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry|date=August 2012|volume=73|issue=8|pages=1103-9|doi=10.4088/JCP.11m07607|pmid=22938842}}</ref> The use of indirect [[sympathomimetic drug]]s or drugs affecting serotonin reuptake, such as [[meperidine]] or [[dextromethorphan]] poses a risk for [[hypertension]] and [[serotonin syndrome]] respectively; alternative agents are recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=MS|last2=Muir|first2=H|last3=Hall|first3=R|title=Perioperative management of drug therapy, clinical considerations.|journal=Drugs|date=February 1996|volume=51|issue=2|pages=238-59|pmid=8808166}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blom-Peters|first1=L|last2=Lamy|first2=M|title=Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and anesthesia: an updated literature review.|journal=Acta anaesthesiologica Belgica|date=1993|volume=44|issue=2|pages=57-60|pmid=8237297}}</ref> Other studies have come to similar conclusions.<ref name="pmid28579071"/> Pharmacokinetic interactions with anesthetics are unlikely, given that tranylcypromine is a high-affinity substrate for [[CYP2A6]] and does not inhibit CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations.<ref name="PMID28655495"/>

 


 
Tranylcypromine [[substance abuse|abuse]] has been reported at doses ranging from 120-600 mg per day.<ref name=EMC/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Le Gassicke|first1=J|last2=Ashcroft|first2=GW|last3=Eccleston|first3=D|last4=Evans|first4=JI|last5=Oswald|first5=I|last6=Ritson|first6=EB|title=The Clinical State, Sleep and Amine Metabolism of a Tranylcypromine (`Parnate') Addict|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 April 1965|volume=111|issue=473|pages=357â€“364|doi=10.1192/bjp.111.473.357}}</ref><ref name="pmid28579071"/> It is thought that higher doses have more [[amphetamine]]-like effects and abuse is promoted by the fast onset and short half-life of tranylcypromine.<ref name="pmid28579071"/>

 


 
Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during tranylcypromine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation.<ref name=EMC/>

 


 
Symptoms of tranylcypromine overdose are generally more intense manifestations of its usual effects.<ref name=EMC/>
