Like other antiarrhythmics, ibutilide can lead to [[arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] due to its ability to prolong the [[QT interval]], which can lead to the potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm known as [[torsades de pointes]]. Consequently, the drug is contraindicated in patients that are likely to develop abnormal heart rhythms; this includes persons that have had [[polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]] in the past, have a long QT interval, [[sick sinus syndrome]], or a recent [[myocardial infarction]], among others.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=2007/2008|volume=1|pages=1768–71|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}</ref>
