Sunitinib adverse events are considered somewhat manageable and the incidence of serious adverse events low.<ref name=demetri /><ref name=motzer />

 


 
The most common adverse events associated with sunitinib therapy are fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, hypertension, a yellow skin discoloration, hand-foot skin reaction, and stomatitis.<ref name="Yellow skin discoloration associated with sorafenib use for treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma."/> In the placebo-controlled Phase III GIST study, adverse events which occurred more often with sunitinib than placebo included diarrhea, anorexia, skin discoloration, mucositis/stomatitis, asthenia, altered taste, and constipation.<ref name=PI /><ref name=demetri />

 


 
Dose reductions were required in 50% of the patients studied in RCC in order to manage the significant toxicities of this agent.

 


 
Serious (grade 3 or 4) adverse events occur in ≤10% of patients and include hypertension, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, and [[chemotherapy-induced acral erythema]]. Lab abnormalities associated with sunitinib therapy include lipase, amylase, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets. Hypothyroidism and reversible erythrocytosis have also been associated with sunitinib.<ref name=PI /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alexandrescu | first1 = DT | last2 = McClure | first2 = R | last3 = Farzanmehr | first3 = H | last4 = Dasanu | first4 = CA |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2008 | title = ''Secondary erythrocytosis produced by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib'' | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 26 | issue = 24| pages = 4047–8 | doi=10.1200/jco.2008.18.3525 | pmid=18711201}}</ref>

 


 
Most adverse events can be managed through supportive care, dose interruption, or dose reduction.<ref name=demetri /><ref name=motzer />

 


 
A recent study done at MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the outcomes of metastatic renal cell cancer patients who received sunitinib on the standard schedule (50&nbsp;mg/4 weeks on 2 weeks off)  with those who received sunitinib with more frequent and short drug holidays (alternative schedule). It was seen that the overall survival, progression free survival and drug adherence were significantly higher in the patients who received Sunitinib on the alternative schedule. Patients also had a better tolerance and lower severity of adverse events which frequently lead to discontinuation of treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer patients.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Atkinson BJ, Kalra S, Wang X, Bathala T, Corn P, Tannir NM, Jonasch E | date=March 2014 | title = Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Treated with Alternative Sunitinib Schedules. |url = | journal = J Urol | volume = 191 | issue = 3| pages = 611–618 | doi = 10.1016/j.juro.2013.08.090}}</ref>
