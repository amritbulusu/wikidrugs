Nausea is a common side effect of IV administration and less common in other modes. [[Antiemetics]] can be given prior to DHE to counteract the nausea. Risks and contraindications are similar to the triptans. DHE and triptans should never be taken within 24 hours of each other due to the potential for coronary artery vasospasm. DHE produces no dependence.<ref name="pmid12970106">{{cite journal |author1=Schaerlinger, B. |author2=Hickel, P. |author3=Etienne, N. |author4=Guesnier, L. |author5=Maroteaux, L. | title = Agonist actions of dihydroergotamine at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors and their possible relevance to antimigraine efficacy | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | year = 2003  | volume = 140 | issue = 2 | pages = 277â€“284 | pmid = 12970106 | pmc = 1574033 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0705437 }}</ref>
