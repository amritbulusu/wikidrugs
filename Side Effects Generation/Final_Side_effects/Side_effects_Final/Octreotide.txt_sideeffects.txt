The most frequent adverse effects (more than 10% of patients) are headache, [[hypothyroidism]], [[Electrical conduction system of the heart|cardiac conduction]] changes, [[gastrointestinal]] reactions (including cramps, nausea/vomiting and diarrhoea or constipation), [[gallstone]]s, reduction of [[insulin]] release, [[hyperglycemia]]<ref name="pmid20132129">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hovind P, Simonsen L, Bülow J | title = Decreased leg glucose uptake during exercise contributes to the hyperglycaemic effect of octreotide | journal = Clin Physiol Funct Imaging | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–5 |date=March 2010 | pmid = 20132129 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-097X.2009.00917.x }}</ref> or [[hypoglycemia]], and (usually transient) injection site reactions. [[Slow heart rate]], skin reactions such as [[pruritus]], [[hyperbilirubinemia]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[dizziness]] and [[dyspnoea]] are also fairly common (more than 1%).
