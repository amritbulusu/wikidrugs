 
Trimetazidine has been treated as a drug with a high safety and tolerability profile.<ref name=Cochrane2005/>  It interacts with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s.

 


 
There is scarce information about trimetazidine's effect on mortality, cardiovascular events or quality of life. Long term randomized controlled trials comparing trimetazidine against standard anti-anginal agents, using clinically important outcomes would be justifiable.<ref name=Cochrane2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciapponi A, Pizarro R, Harrison J | title = Trimetazidine for stable angina | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 4 | pages = CD003614 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16235330 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003614.pub2 | url = http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD003614/trimetazidine-for-stable-angina }}</ref> Recently, an international multicentre retrospective cohort study has indeed shown that in patients with heart failure of different etiologies, the addition of trimetazidine on conventional optimal therapy can improve mortality and morbidity.<ref>Fragasso G, Rosano G, Baek Hong S, Sisakian H, Di Napoli P, Alberti L, Calori G, Kang SM, Sahakyan A, Vitale C, Marazzi G, Margonato A, Belardinelli R.

EMA recommends that doctors should no longer prescribe trimetazidine for the treatment of patients with [[tinnitus]], [[vertigo]] or disturbances in vision.<ref name = "EMA_press_release">{{cite web | url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2012/06/WC500129070.pdf | title = European Medicines Agency recommends restricting use of trimetazidine-containing medicines | format = pdf | work = Press release | date = 2012-06-12 | publisher = European Medicines Agency }}</ref> The recent EMA evaluation also revealed rare cases (3.6/1 000 000 patient years) of [[Parkinsonian]] (or extrapyramidal) symptoms (such as tremor, rigidity, akinesia, hypertonia), gait instability, [[restless leg syndrome]], other related  movement disorders, majority of patient recovered within 4 months after treatment discontinuation, therefore, doctors are advised not to prescribe the medicine either to patients with Parkinson disease, parkinsonian symptoms, tremors, restless leg syndrome or other related movement disorders, nor to patients with severe renal impairment.<ref name = "EMA_press_release"/>
