;Common (>1% incidence) adverse effects include:

 
* Extrapyramidal side effects such as: (which ''usually'' become apparent soon after therapy is begun or soon after an increase in dose is made)

 
:- Muscle rigidity

 
:- [[Hypokinesia]]

 
:- [[Hyperkinesia]]

 
:- [[Parkinsonism]]

 
:- Tremor

 
:- [[Akathisia]]

 
:- [[Dystonia]]

 
* Dry mouth

 
* Constipation

 
* Hypersalivation — excessive salivation

 
* Blurred vision

 
* Diaphoresis — excessive sweating

 
* Nausea

 
* Dizziness

 
* [[Somnolence]]

 
* Restlessness

 
* Insomnia

 
* Overactivity

 
* Headache

 
* Nervousness

 
* Fatigue

 
* Myalgia

 
* [[Hyperprolactinemia]] and its complications such as: (''acutely'')

 
:- Sexual dysfunction

 
:- Amenorrhea — cessation of menstrual cycles

 
:- Gynecomastia — enlargement of breast tissue in males

 
:- Galactorrhea — the expulsion of breast milk that's not related to breastfeeding or pregnancy

 
: and if the hyperprolactinemia persists ''chronically'', the following adverse effects may be seen:

 
:- Reduced bone mineral density leading to [[osteoporosis]] (brittle bones)

 
:- Infertility

 
* Dyspepsia — indigestion

 
* Abdominal pain

 
* Flatulence

 
* Nasal congestion

 
* Polyuria — passing more urine than usual

 


 
;Uncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects include:

 
* Fainting

 
* Palpitations

 


 
;Rare (<0.1% incidence) adverse effects include:

 
* Blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in the cell composition of blood), such as:

 
:- [[Agranulocytosis]] — a drop in white blood cell counts that leaves one open to potentially life-threatening infections

 
:- [[Neutropenia]] — a drop in the number of [[neutrophils]] (white blood cells that specifically fight bacteria) in one's blood

 
:- [[Leucopenia]] — a less severe drop in white blood cell counts than agranulocytosis

 
:- [[Thrombocytopenia]] — a drop in the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are responsible for blood clotting and hence this leads to an increased risk of bruising and other bleeds

 
* [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] — a potentially fatal condition that appear to result from central [[Dopamine D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] blockade. The symptoms include:

 
:- [[Hyperthermia]]

 
:- Muscle rigidity

 
:- [[Rhabdomyolysis]]

 
:- Autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, diarrhea, diaphoresis, etc.)

 
:- Mental status changes (e.g. coma, agitation, anxiety, confusion, etc.)

 


 
;Unknown incidence adverse effects include:

 
* Jaundice

 
* Abnormal liver function test results

 
* [[Tardive dyskinesia]] — an often incurable movement disorder that usually results from years of continuous treatment with antipsychotic drugs, especially [[typical antipsychotics]] like flupenthixol. It presents with repetitive, involuntary, purposeless and slow movements

 
* Hypotension

 
* Confusional state

 
* Seizures

 
* [[Mania]]

 
* [[Hypomania]]

 
* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]

 
* Hot flush

 
* Anergia

 
* Appetite changes

 
* Weight changes

 
* Hyperglycemia — high blood glucose (sugar) levels

 
* Abnormal glucose tolerance

 
* Pruritus — itchiness

 
* Rash

 
* Dermatitis

 
* Photosensitivity — sensitivity to light

 
* Oculogyric crisis

 
* Accommodation disorder

 
* Sleep disorder

 
* Impaired concentration

 
* Tachycardia

 
* [[QTc interval]] prolongation — an abnormality in the electrical activity of the heart that can lead to potentially fatal changes in heart rhythm

 
* [[Torsades de pointes]]

 
* Miosis — constriction of the pupil of the eye

 
* Paralytic [[ileus]] — paralysis of the bowel muscles leading to severe constipation, inability to pass wind, etc.

 
* Mydriasis

 
* [[Glaucoma]]
