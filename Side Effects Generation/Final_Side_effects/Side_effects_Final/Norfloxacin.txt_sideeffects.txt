Post-marketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects that are associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder [[myasthenia gravis]] are the subject of "black box" warnings in the United States. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kim GK |title=The Risk of Fluoroquinolone-induced Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture: What Does The Clinician Need To Know? |journal=J Clin Aesthet Dermatol |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=49–54 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20725547 |pmc=2921747 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sode J, Obel N, Hallas J, Lassen A |title=Use of fluroquinolone and risk of Achilles tendon rupture: a population-based cohort study |journal=Eur.
