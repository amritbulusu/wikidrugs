Nefiracetam's cytoprotective actions are mediated by enhancement of [[GABAergic]], [[cholinergic]], and [[monoaminergic]] neuronal systems. It has been shown to effectively treat apathy and improve motivation in post-stroke patients. It has been shown to exhibit antiamnesia effects for the Alzheimer's type and cerebrovascular type of dementia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Robinson RG, Jorge RE, Clarence-Smith K, Starkstein S |title=Double-blind treatment of apathy in patients with poststroke depression using nefiracetam |journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=144–51 |year=2009 |pmid=19622685 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.2.144}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Robinson RG, Jorge RE, Clarence-Smith K |title=Double-blind randomized treatment of poststroke depression using nefiracetam |journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=178–84 |year=2008 |pmid=18451188 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.20.2.178}}</ref> In addition, it has also been shown to have antiamnesia effects against a wide variety of memory impairing substances, including: ethanol, chlorodiazepoxide (Librium), scopolamine, bicuculline, picrotoxin, and cycloheximide.<ref name="Effects of nefiracetam on amnesia animal models with neuronal dysfunctions">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hiramatsu M, Shiotani T, Kameyama T, Nabeshima T |title=Effects of nefiracetam on amnesia animal models with neuronal dysfunctions|journal=
