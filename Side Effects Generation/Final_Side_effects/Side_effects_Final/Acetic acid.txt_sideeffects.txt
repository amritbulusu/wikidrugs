Concentrated acetic acid is [[corrosion|corrosive]] to skin and must therefore be handled with appropriate care to avoid skin burns, permanent eye damage, and irritation to the mucous membranes.<ref name="IPCS card">{{cite web | url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0363.htm | title=ICSC 0363 – ACETIC ACID | publisher=International Programme on Chemical Safety | date=5 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=CDC>{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0002-rev.pdf | title=Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Acetic Acid | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> These burns or blisters may not appear until hours after exposure.

 


 
Prolonged skin contact with glacial acetic acid may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation exposure (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.

 


 
It has been reported that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm has been reported. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of the skin of the hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).<ref>{{citation |publisher=Virginia Department of Health Division of Health Hazards Control |first=Peter C. |last= Sherertz |date=1 June 1994 |title=Acetic Acid |url=http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/DEE/PublicHealthToxicology/documents/pdf/aceticacid.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110629/http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/DEE/PublicHealthToxicology/documents/pdf/aceticacid.PDF|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

 


 
The hazards of solutions of acetic acid depend on the concentration. The following table lists the [[Directive 67/548/EEC|EU classification]] of acetic acid solutions:<ref name="Yee13">{{cite web |url=http://hsis.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/downloads/HSIS%20Consolidated%20List%20-%20Alphabetical%20Index.xlsx |title=HSIS Consolidated List – Alphabetical Index|last=Yee|first=Allan|date=10 May 2013|publisher=Safe Work Australia|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref>

Solutions at more than 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, corrosive vapour. [[Concentration|Dilute]] acetic acid, in the form of [[vinegar]], is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the [[digestive system]], and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the [[blood]].

 


 
Due to incompatibilities, it is recommended to keep acetic acid away from [[chromic acid]], [[ethylene glycol]], [[nitric acid]], [[perchloric acid]], [[permanganate]]s, [[peroxide]]s and [[hydroxyl]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9922769|title=Acetic acid MSDS|date=21 May 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>

 


 
Concentrated acetic acid can be ignited only with difficulty at standard temperature and pressure, but becomes a flammable risk in temperatures greater than {{convert|39|C|F}}, and can form explosive mixtures with air at higher temperatures ([[explosive limit]]s: 5.4–16%).
