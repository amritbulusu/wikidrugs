Side effects of loprazolam are generally the same as for other benzodiazepines such as [[diazepam]].<ref>[http://www.bnf.org.uk/bnf/bnf/53/3141.htm British National Formulary Benzodiazepines Information]</ref> The most significant difference in side effects of loprazolam and diazepam is it is less prone to day time sedation as the half-life of loprazolam is considered to be intermediate whereas diazepam has a very long half-life. The side effects of loprazolam are the following:

 


 
* [[drowsiness]]

 
* paradoxical increase in aggression

 
* [[lightheadedness]]

 
* [[confusion]]

 
* muscle weakness

 
* [[ataxia]] (particularly in the elderly)

 
* [[amnesia]]

 
* [[headache]]

 
* [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]

 
* [[hypotension]]

 
*salivation changes

 
* gastro-intestinal disturbances

 
* visual disturbances

 
* [[dysarthria]]

 
* [[tremor]]

 
* changes in [[libido]]

 
* [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]]

 
* [[urinary retention]]

 
* [[blood disorders]] and [[jaundice]]

 
* [[skin]] reactions

 
* dependence and withdrawal reactions

 


 
Residual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of loprazolam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions may persist into the next day which may increase risks of falls and [[hip fractures]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vermeeren A. | year = 2004 | month = | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs. | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297&ndash;328 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref>
