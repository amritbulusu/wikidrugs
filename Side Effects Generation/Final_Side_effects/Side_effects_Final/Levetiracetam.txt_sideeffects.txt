The most common adverse effects of levetiracetam treatment include CNS effects such as somnolence, decreased energy, headache, dizziness, mood swings and coordination difficulties. These adverse effects are most pronounced in the first month of therapy. About 4% of patients dropped out of pre-approval clinical trials due to these side effects.<ref name=":0" />

 


 
About 13% of people taking levetiracetam experience adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are usually mild. These include agitation, hostility, apathy, anxiety, emotional lability, and depression. Serious psychiatric adverse side effects that are reversed by drug discontinuation occur in about 1%. These include hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, or psychosis. These occurred mostly within the first month of therapy, but they could develop at any time during treatment.<ref name="pmid18728811">{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/NDT.S1655 |pmid=18728811 |pmc=2515905 |title=Monotherapy for partial epilepsy: Focus on levetiracetam |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=33–8 |year=2008 |last1=Gambardella |first1=Antonio }}</ref>

 


 
A study published in 2005 suggests that the addition of [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B6) may reduce some of the psychiatric symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.460801_16.x |pmid=15987269 |title=Clinical Epilepsy: Pediatrics |journal=Epilepsia |volume=46 |pages=142–7 |year=2005 |author1=Naylor |first1=D.

Although rare, [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] (SJS) and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (TEN), which appears as a painful spreading rash with redness and blistering and/or peeling skin, have been reported in patients treated with levetiracetam.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.seizure.2012.09.005 |pmid=23036769 |title=Stevens–Johnson syndrome induced by levetiracetam |journal=Seizure |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=823–5 |year=2012 |last1=Zou |first1=Li-Ping |last2=Ding |first2=Chang-Hong |last3=Song |first3=Zhen-Jiang |last4=Li |first4=Xiao-Feng }}</ref> The incidence of SJS following exposure to anti-epileptics such as levetiracetam is about 1 in 3,000.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1998.tb01680.x |pmid=9798757 |title=Acute Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions and Seizures |journal=Epilepsia |volume=39 |pages=S17–21 |year=1998 |last1=Griebel |first1=May L. }}</ref>

 


 
Levetiracetam should not be used in people who have previously shown hypersensitivity to levetiracetam or any of the inactive ingredients in the tablet or oral solution. Such hypersensitivity reactions include, but are not limited to, unexplained rash with redness or blistered skin, difficulty breathing, and tightness in the chest or airways.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/021035s078s080,021505s021s024lbl.pdf |title=Keppra (levetiracetam) Prescribing Information |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}</ref>
