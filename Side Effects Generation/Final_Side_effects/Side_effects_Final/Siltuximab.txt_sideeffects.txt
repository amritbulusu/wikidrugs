Siltuximab may lower resistance to infections and should not be administered to patients with severe infections. Siltuximab should be discontinued in patients with severe infusion related reactions, anaphylaxis, severe allergic reactions or cytokine release syndromes. Live vaccines should not be administered to patients receiving siltuximab since IL-6 inhibition may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens.<ref name="sylvantPI"/>
