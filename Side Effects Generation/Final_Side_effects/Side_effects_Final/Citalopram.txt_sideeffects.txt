[[Sexual dysfunction]] is often a side effect with SSRIs. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and [[anorgasmia]] (trouble achieving orgasm). One study showed, however, when remission of major depressive disorder is achieved, quality of life and sexual satisfaction is reported to be higher in spite of sexual side effects.<ref>Ishak WW, Christensen S, Sayer G, Ha K, Li N, Miller J, Nguyen JM, Cohen RM. Sexual satisfaction and quality of life in major depressive disorder before and after treatment with citalopram in the STAR*D study" ''J Clin Psychiatry'' 2013 Mar;74(3) 256-61. {{DOI|10.4088/JCP.12m07933}}</ref>

 


 
Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of [[serotonin]] in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in [[dopamine]] release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild [[antihistamine]], which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.<ref name="Stahl_2011"/>{{rp|104}}

 


 
Common side effects of citalopram include [[Somnolence|drowsiness]], [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased sex drive, anorgasmia, dry mouth,<ref name="Citalopram_PI_Sheet"/> increased [[perspiration|sweating]], [[Tremor|trembling]], [[diarrhea]], excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. Less common side effects include [[bruxism]], [[vomiting]], [[cardiac arrhythmia]], [[blood pressure]] changes, dilated pupils, [[anxiety]], [[mood swing]]s, [[headache]], and [[dizziness]]. Rare side effects include [[Seizure|convulsions]], [[hallucinations]], severe [[Allergy|allergic reactions]] and [[photosensitivity]].<ref name="Citalopram_PI_Sheet"/> If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Arora | first1 = G | last2 = Sandhu | first2 = G | last3 = Fleser | first3 = C | date = Spring 2012 | title = Citalopram and nightmares | url = | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 24 | issue = 2| page = E43 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11040096 }}</ref>

 


 
Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as [[paraesthesiae]], sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished.

 


 
Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed state]], especially in those with undiagnosed [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name="Stahl_2011"/>{{rp|105}}
