Side effects are mostly dose dependent. Much more severe side effects are reported for treatment of Parkinson's disease and (off-label treatment) for [[restless leg syndrome]] which both typically require very high doses. The side effects are considered mild when used for treatment of hyperprolactinemia and other endocrine disorders or gynecologic indications where the typical dose is one hundredthe to one tenth that for Parkinson's disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

 


 
Cabergoline requires slow dose titration (2â€“4 weeks for hyperprolactinemia, often much longer for other conditions) to minimise side effects. The extremely long bioavailability of the medication may complicate dosing regimens during titration and require particular precautions.

 


 
Cabergoline is considered the best tolerable option for hyperprolactinemia treatment although the newer and less tested [[quinagolide]] may offer similarly favourable side effect profile with quicker titration times.

 


 
Approximately 200 patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease participated in a [[Clinical trial|clinical study]] of cabergoline monotherapy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Seventy-nine (79) percent reported at least one side effect. These side effects were chiefly mild or moderate:

 
* GI tract: Side effects were extremely frequent. Fifty-three percent of patients reported side effects.  Very frequent: [[Nausea]] (30%), [[constipation]] (22%), and dry mouth (10%). Frequent:  Gastric irritation (7%), [[vomiting]] (5%), and [[dyspepsia]] (2%).

 
* [[psychiatry|Psychiatric]] disturbances and [[central nervous system]] (CNS): Altogether 51 percent of patients were affected.  Very frequent: Sleep disturbances ([[somnolence]] 18%, [[insomnia]] 11%), [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] (27%), and [[Clinical depression|depression]] (13%). Frequent: [[dyskinesia]] (4%) and [[hallucinations]] (4%).

 
* Cardiovascular: Approximately 30 percent of patients experienced side effects. Most frequent were hypotension (10%), peripheral [[edema]] (14%) and non-specific edema (2%). [[Arrhythmias]] were encountered in 4.8%, [[palpitations]] in 4.3%, and [[angina pectoris]] in 1.4%.

 


 
In a combination study with 2,000 patients also treated with levodopa, the incidence and severity of side effects was comparable to monotherapy. Encountered side effects required a termination of cabergoline treatment in 15% of patients. Additional side effects were infrequent cases of [[hematology|hematological]] side effects, and an occasional increase in liver [[enzymes]] or [[Blood serum|serum]] [[creatinine]] without [[Medical sign|sign]]s or [[symptoms]].

 


 
As with other ergot derivatives, [[pleuritis]], [[exudative]] pleura disease, pleura [[fibrosis]], [[lung]] fibrosis, and [[pericarditis]] are seen. These side effects are noted in less than 2% of patients. They require immediate termination of treatment. Clinical improvement and normalization of [[X-ray]] findings are normally seen soon after cabergoline [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. It appears that the dose typically used for treatment of hyperprolactinemia is too low to cause this type of side effects.
