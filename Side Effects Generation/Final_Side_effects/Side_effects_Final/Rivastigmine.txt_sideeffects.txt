The strong potency of rivastigmine, provided by its dual inhibitory mechanism, has been postulated to lead to more nausea and vomiting during the titration phase of oral rivastigmine treatment.<ref name=Inglis/> This enforces the importance of taking oral forms of these drugs with food as prescribed.<ref name="ProductInsert"/>   However, rates of nausea and vomiting are markedly reduced with the once-daily rivastigmine patch (which can be applied at any time of the day, with or without food).

 
Patients and caregivers should be aware of warning signs of potential toxicities and know when to call their doctor. For the patch and oral formulations, skin rashes can occur at which time patients should contact their doctor immediately.<ref name="pharma.us.novartis.com"/> For the patch, patients and caregivers should monitor for any intense itching, redness, swelling or blistering at the patch location. If this occurs, remove the patch, rinse the area and call the doctor immediately.<ref name="exelonpatch.com"/>

 


 
In a large clinical trial of the rivastigmine patch in 1,195 patients with Alzheimer's disease, the target dose of 9.5&nbsp;mg/24-hour patch provided similar clinical effects (e.g. memory and thinking, activities of daily living, concentration) as the highest doses of rivastigmine capsules, but with one-third fewer reports of nausea and vomiting.<ref name=Winblad>{{Cite journal | last1 = Winblad | first1 = B. | last2 = Grossberg | first2 = G. | last3 = Frölich | first3 = L. | last4 = Farlow | first4 = M. | last5 = Zechner | first5 = S. | last6 = Nagel | first6 = J. | last7 = Lane | first7 = R. | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000281847.17519.e0 | title = IDEAL: A 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the first skin patch for Alzheimer disease | journal = Neurology | volume = 69 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S14–S22 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17646619| pmc = }}</ref>

 


 
Usage of rivastigmine was associated with a higher frequency of reports of death as an adverse event in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database compared to the other acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drugs donepezil and galantamine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali TB, Schleret TR, Reilly BM, Chen WY, Abagyan R |title=Adverse Effects of Cholinesterase Inhibitors in Dementia, According to the Pharmacovigilance Databases of the United-States and Canada |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=e0144337 |year=2015 |pmid=26642212 |pmc=4671709 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144337 }}</ref>
