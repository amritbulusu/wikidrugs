The effects of BZP are largely similar to [[amphetamine]]s,<ref name="Schep2011"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fantegrossi W, Winger G, Woods J, Woolverton W, Coop A |title=Reinforcing and discriminative stimulus effects of 1-benzylpiperazine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine in rhesus monkeys |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=161–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15664717 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.07.014}}</ref> with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts were unable to distinguish between [[dextroamphetamine]] and BZP administered intravenously.<ref name=Campbell /> Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose.<ref name="Drug-Forum">{{cite web|title =BZP Experiences |publisher = drugs-forum.co.uk|date = 8 July 2007|url =http://www.drugs-forum.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?t=34969%7CDrug
