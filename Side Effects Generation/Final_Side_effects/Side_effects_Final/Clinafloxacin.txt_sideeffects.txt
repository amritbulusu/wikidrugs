The phototoxicity with clinafloxacin has been more associated with oral dosing as compared to intravenous dosing, though the studies that described this were subject to [[confounding]] by study site (that is, patients that received intravenous clinafloxacin were less mobile, and thereby received less sunlight exposure).<ref name="Kucers 6ed" /> 

 


 
The mechanism for clinafloxacin's phototoxicity involves the [[chlorine]] atom at position 8. In the presence of [[ultraviolet light]], the chemical structure of clinafloxacin is degraded, resulting in the formation of toxic, [[reactive oxygen species]] that can damage cellular structures--including [[DNA]]. For this reason clinafloxacin can also be classified as a [[photocarcinogen]] (a chemical that can cause light-induced cancer), though the risk of developing cancer in humans taking the medication is small.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

 


 
The mechanism for clinafloxacin's effect on blood glucose is thought to involve stimulation of the pancreatic [[beta cells]], which produce [[insulin]] (a hormone that lowers blood glucose levels).<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

 


 
The symptoms of clinafloxacin overdose are unknown.<ref name="Clina Overdose">{{cite web|title=In case of emergency/overdose|url=http://www.clinafloxacin.com/clinafloxacin_emergency.html|website=clinafloxacin.com|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>
