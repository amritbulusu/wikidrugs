Side effects of lormetazepam are similar to those of other hypnotic benzodiazepines and can for the most part be regarded as a class effect.<ref>[http://www.bnf.org.uk/bnf/bnf/53/3141.htm British National Formulary Benzodiazepines Information]</ref> In a sleep study, 1&nbsp;mg lormetazepam increased total sleep time, reduced wakefulness, but did not alter [[REM sleep]]. However, at 2&nbsp;mg doses, there were significant increases in stage 3 sleep and reductions in REM sleep. [[Rebound effect]]s have been reported after chronic use including rebound REM.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6120717 |pmc=1402107 |year=1982 |last1=Nicholson |first1=AN |last2=Stone |title=Hypnotic activity and effects on performance of lormetazepam and camazepam--analogues of temazepam |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=433–9 |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |first2=BM |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1982.tb01398.x}}</ref> In one clinical trial with patients who had prior experience with older hypnotics [[temazepam]] and [[nitrazepam]], most preferred lormetazepam due to less heavy sedation, amnesia, and residual effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hill RC, Harry TV |title=Lormetazepam (Lorámet): a multicentre assessment of its efficacy and acceptability as a hypnotic in out-patients with sleep disturbances |journal=J.

Although lormetazepam has been associated with adversely affecting immediate and delayed recall memory functions,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Dorow|author2=Berenberg D |author3=Duka T |author4=Sauerbrey N. |title= Amnestic effects of lormetazepam and their reversal by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 |journal= Psychopharmacology |volume= 93 |issue= 4 |pages= 507–514 |year= 1987|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t7203v38w371357k/ |doi=10.1007/bf00207244}}</ref> studies have shown that lormetazepam's amnesic properties may be lesser compared to other hypnotic benzodiazepines. For example, in a 1984 study comparing the amnesic effects of lormetazepam to temazepam and flurazepam showed that amnesia was smallest after lormetazepam and greatest after temazepam, which had produced greater amnesia than both lormetazepam and flurazepam by a significant margin.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Amnesic effects of lormetazepam |journal= Psychopharmacology Suppl. |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |pages= 165–72. |year= 1984|pmid= 6147838 |author= Roehrs T, McLenaghan A, Koshorek G, Zorick F, Roth T. |doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-69659-6_14 |series= Psychopharmacology Supplementum |isbn= 978-3-642-69661-9 |last2= McLenaghan |last3= Koshorek |last4= Zorick |last5= Roth}}</ref>
