The most prevalent side effects for cariprazine include [[akathisia]], [[insomnia]], and [[weight gain]]. Cariprazine does not appear to impact metabolic variables or prolactin levels, and unlike many other antipsychotics, does not increase the electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval. In short term clinical trials extrapyramidal effects, sedation, akathisia, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, anxiety, and constipation were observed. One review characterized the frequency of these events as "not greatly different from that seen in patient treated with placebo"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Citrome L |title=Cariprazine in schizophrenia: clinical efficacy, tolerability, and place in therapy |journal=Adv Ther |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=114–26 | date=February 2013 |pmid=23361833 |doi=10.1007/s12325-013-0006-7 |url=}}</ref> but a second called the incidence of movement-related disorders "rather high".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Veselinović T, Paulzen M, Gründer G |title=Cariprazine, a new, orally active dopamine D2/3 receptor partial agonist for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania and depression |journal=Expert Rev Neurother |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=1141–59 | date=November 2013 |pmid=24175719 |doi=10.1586/14737175.2013.853448 |url=}}</ref><ref name="Newman-Tancredi2011">{{Cite journal | last1 = Newman-Tancredi | first1 = A. | last2 = Kleven | first2 = MS. | title = Comparative pharmacology of antipsychotics possessing combined dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor properties | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 216 | issue = 4 | pages = 451–73 |date=Aug 2011 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-011-2247-y | pmid = 21394633 }}</ref>
