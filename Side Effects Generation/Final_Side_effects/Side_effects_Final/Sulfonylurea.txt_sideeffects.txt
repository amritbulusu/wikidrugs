Sulfonylureas, as opposed to [[metformin]], the [[thiazolidinedione]]s, [[exenatide]], [[symlin]] and other newer treatment agents may induce [[hypoglycemia]] as a result of excesses in insulin production and release. This typically occurs if the dose is too high, and the patient is fasting. Some people attempt to change eating habits to prevent this, however it can be counter productive.

 


 
Like [[insulin]], sulfonylureas can induce weight gain, mainly as a result of their effect to increase insulin levels and thus utilization of glucose and other metabolic fuels. Other side-effects are: gastrointestinal upset, [[headache]] and [[hypersensitivity]] reactions.

 


 
The safety of sulfonylurea therapy in pregnancy is unestablished.  Prolonged hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in children borne to mothers taking sulfonylureas at the time of delivery.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/017532s030lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Impairment of liver or kidney function increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and are contraindications. As other anti-diabetic drugs cannot be used either under these circumstances, insulin therapy is typically recommended during pregnancy and in hepatic and renal failure, although some of the newer agents offer potentially better options.

 


 
A 2014 Cochrane review found tentative evidence that people treated with sulfonylureas have fewer non-fatal cardiovascular events than those treated with metformin (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93) but a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (RR 5.64, 95% CI 1.22 to 26.00).
