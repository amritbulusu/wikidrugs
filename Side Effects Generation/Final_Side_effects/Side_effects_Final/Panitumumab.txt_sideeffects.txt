Panitumumab has been associated with skin rash, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, fever, and decreased magnesium levels. Often, skin rash is noted in the sun exposed parts of the body, such as the face or chest. Oral antibiotics may be needed for worsening skin rash, such as one accompanied with blisters and ulcers. Otherwise, topical steroid creams like hydrocortisone may help.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1200/JCO.2008.21.7828|pmid=20142600|title=Skin Toxicity Evaluation Protocol with Panitumumab (STEPP), a Phase II, Open-Label, Randomized Trial Evaluating the Impact of a Pre-Emptive Skin Treatment Regimen on Skin Toxicities and Quality of Life in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1351â€“7|year=2010|last1=Lacouture|first1=M.

Ocular toxicity or keratitis was observed in 16% of patients on panitumumab, usually necessitating the discontinuance of therapy.<ref>https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panitumumab-drug-information?source=search_result&search=panitumumab&selectedTitle=1~33</ref>

 


 
In clinical trials, 90% of patients had dermatological toxicities and 15% of those were severe. Because of this, panitumumab has a [[boxed warning]] cautioning patients. Skin toxicities were typically apparent two weeks after beginning treatment. More severe skin toxicities were associated with improved progression free survival and overall survival.<ref>https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panitumumab-drug-information?source=search_result&search=panitumumab&selectedTitle=1~33</ref>
