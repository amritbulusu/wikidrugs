An animal study in rabbits demonstrated that estazolam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous [[EEG]] including high voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and [[amygdala]], while the [[hippocampal]] theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low voltage fast waves occur particularly in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] EEG. The EEG arousal response to [[Sound|auditory]] stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[hypothalamus]] and centromedian [[thalamus]] is significantly suppressed. The [[photic driving response]] elicited by a flash light in the [[visual cortex]] is significantly suppressed by estazolam.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Watanabe S |author2=Ohta H |author3=Sakurai Y |author4=Takao K |author5=Ueki S.  |date=July 1986 | title = [Electroencephalographic effects of 450191-S and its metabolites in rabbits with chronic electrode implants] | journal = Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi. | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 19â€“32 | pmid = 3758874 | doi=10.1254/fpj.88.19}}</ref>
