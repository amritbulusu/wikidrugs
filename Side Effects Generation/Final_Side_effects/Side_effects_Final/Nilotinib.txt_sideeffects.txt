{{See also|List of adverse effects of nilotinib}}

 
Nilotinib has a number of adverse effects typical of anti-cancer drugs. These include headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation, muscle and joint pain, [[rash]] and other skin conditions, flu-like symptoms, and reduced blood cell count. Less typical side effects are those of the cardiovascular system, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), various types of [[arrhythmia]], and prolonged [[QT interval]]. Nilotinib can also affect the body's [[electrolyte]] and [[glucose]] balance.<ref name = Drugs /> Though pulmonary-related adverse effects are rare when compared with [[imatinib]] and [[dasatinib]], there is a case report of acute respiratory failure from [[diffuse alveolar hemorrhage]] in a patient taking nilotinib.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24467220 Donatelli, Christopher, Daych Chongnarungsin, and Rendell Ashton.
