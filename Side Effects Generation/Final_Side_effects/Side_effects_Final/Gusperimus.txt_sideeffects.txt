Currently, only provisional and preliminary data about side-effects is available. The following side-effects have been noticed so far:

 


 
* [[Dysgeusia]] (abnormal or bad taste)

 
* Drug induced [[leukopenia]] (very common){{quantify|date=March 2015}}

 
* Significant infections related to therapy.

 


 
It is not known if therapy with gusperimus may increase the risk of malignant diseases (lymphoma, leukemia, solid tumors), as is the case with other highly potent immunosuppressant agents such as [[ciclosporin]] or [[tacrolimus]].
