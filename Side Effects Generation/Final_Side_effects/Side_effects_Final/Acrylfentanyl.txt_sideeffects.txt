Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Jane|last1=Mounteney|first2=Isabelle|last2=Giraudon|first3=Gleb|last3=Denissov|first4=Paul|last4=Griffiths|title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?

As [[acrylamide]] derivatives are often used in [[drug discovery]] to make covalent inhibitors which will bind irreversibly to its target, acrylfentanyl is claimed to be naloxone resistant.<ref>url=http://www.phdmc.org/news-releases-coat/133-community-overdose-action-team-issues-alert-2-feb-17</ref> 

 
However, acute intoxications with acrylfentanyl on mice<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Bruce E.|last1=Maryanoff|first2=Eric J.|last2=Simon|first3=Theresa|last3=Gioannini|first4=H.|last4=Gorissen|title=Potential affinity labels for the opiate receptor based on fentanyl and related compounds|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00350a006|journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry|date=August 1982|pages=913–919|volume=25|issue=8|doi=10.1021/jm00350a006|pmid=6288945}}</ref> threatened by naloxone (2 mg/kg) have shown that acrylfentanyl could be displaced from the opioid receptor.

 


 
Acrylfentanyl has been linked to 20 deaths in Sweden as well as two deaths in Denmark in summer 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rmv.se/index.php?id=433 | title=Akrylfentanyl narkotikaklassas | publisher=Rättsmedicinalverket | date=9 August 2016 | language=sv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Farligt stof i omløb - mistanken rettes mod acryl fentanyl|publisher=mynewsdesk|date=6 September 2016|url=https://www.mynewsdesk.com/dk/nordjyllands-politi/pressreleases/farligt-stof-i-omloeb-mistanken-rettes-mod-acryl-fentanyl-1547605|language=da}}</ref>
