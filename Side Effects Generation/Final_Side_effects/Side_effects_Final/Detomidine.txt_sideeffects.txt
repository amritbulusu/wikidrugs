A profound lethargy and characteristic lowering of the head with reduced sensitivity to environmental stimuli (sound, pain, etc.) are seen with detomidine. A short period of reduced coordination is characteristically followed by immobility and a firm stance with front legs spread.  Following administration there is an initial increase in blood pressure, followed by [[bradycardia]] and second degree [[atrioventricular block]] (this is not [[Pathology (disambiguation)|pathologic]] in horses). The horse commonly [[sweat]]s to excess, especially on the flanks and neck. Other side effects reported include pilo erection (hair standing erect), [[ataxia]], [[salivation]], slight muscle tremors, and (rarely) penile prolapse.
