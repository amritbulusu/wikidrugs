Like pure µ-opioids, the mixed agonists-antagonist opioid class of drugs can cause side effects with initial administration of the drug but which lessen over time (“tolerance”).  This is particularly true for the side effects of nausea, sedation and cognitive symptoms (Jovey et al. 2003).  These side effects can in many instances be ameliorated or avoided at the time of drug initiation by titrating the drug from a tolerable starting dose up to the desired therapeutic dose. An important difference between nalbuphine and the pure mu opioid analgesic drugs is the “ceiling effect” on respiration.  Respiratory depression is a potentially fatal side effect from the use of pure mu opioids.  Nalbuphine has limited ability to depress respiratory function (Gal et al. 1982).

 


 
As reported in the current Nubain Package Insert (2005), the most frequent side effect in 1066 patients treated with nalbuphine was sedation in 381 (36%).

 


 
Other, less frequent reactions are: feeling sweaty/clammy 99 (9%), nausea/vomiting 68 (6%), dizziness/vertigo 58 (5%), dry mouth 44 (4%), and headache 27 (3%). Other adverse reactions which may occur (reported incidence of 1% or less) are:

 
:* CNS effects: Nervousness, depression, restlessness, crying, euphoria, flushing{{Clarify|date=March 2014}}, hostility, unusual dreams, confusion, faintness, hallucinations, dysphoria, feeling of heaviness, numbness, tingling, unreality. The incidence of psychotomimetic effects, such as unreality, depersonalization, delusions, dysphoria and hallucinations has been shown to be less than that which occurs with pentazocine.

 
:* Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, pulmonary edema.

 
:* Gastrointestinal: Cramps, dyspepsia, bitter taste.

 
:* Respiration: Depression, dyspnea, asthma.

 
:* Dermatological: Itching, burning, urticaria.

 
:* Obstetric: Pseudo-sinusoidal fetal heart rhythm.

 


 
Other possible, but rare side effects include speech difficulty, urinary urgency, blurred vision, flushing and warmth.
