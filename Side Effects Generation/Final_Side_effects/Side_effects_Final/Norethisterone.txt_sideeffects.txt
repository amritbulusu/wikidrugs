At contraceptive and hormone replacement dosages (0.35 to 1&nbsp;mg/day), NET has essentially progestogenic [[side effect]]s only. In most clinical studies of NET for contraception or hormone replacement therapy, the drug has been combined with an estrogen, and for this reason, it is difficult to determine which of the side effects were caused by NET and which of them were caused by estrogen in such research. However, NETE, an intramuscularly administered prodrug of NET which is used as a long-acting contraceptive, is used without an estrogen, and hence can be employed as a surrogate for NET in terms of understanding its effects and [[tolerability]]. In clinical studies, the most common side effect with NETE has been [[menstrual disturbance]]s, including [[dysfunctional uterine bleeding|prolonged bleeding or spotting]] and [[amenorrhea]].<ref name="Aronson2009" />{{rp|253}} Other side effects have included periodic [[abdominal bloating]] and [[breast tenderness]], both of which are thought to be due to [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]] and can be relieved with [[diuretic]]s.<ref name="Aronson2009" />{{rp|253}} There has been no association with [[weight gain]], and [[blood pressure]], [[blood clotting]], and [[glucose tolerance]] have all remained normal.<ref name="Aronson2009" />{{rp|253}} However, a decrease in [[HDL cholesterol|{{abbr|HDL|high-density lipoprotein}} cholesterol]] has been observed.<ref name="Aronson2009" />{{rp|253}}

 


 
At high dosages (5 to 60&nbsp;mg/day), for instance those used in the treatment of gynecological disorders, NET can cause [[hypogonadism]] due to its [[antigonadotropic]] effects and can have estrogenic and weak androgenic side effects.
