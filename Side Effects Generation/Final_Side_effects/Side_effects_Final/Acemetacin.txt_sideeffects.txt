Common side effects (in about 1â€“10% of patients) include gastrointestinal problems typical of NSAIDs, such as [[nausea]], diarrhoea, stomach pain, and peptic ulcer; central nervous effects like headache and dizziness; and skin reactions. Gastrointestinal tolerability is better than that of the related drug [[indometacin]]. Severe allergic reactions and haematopoietic disorders occur in fewer than 0.01% of patients.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />
