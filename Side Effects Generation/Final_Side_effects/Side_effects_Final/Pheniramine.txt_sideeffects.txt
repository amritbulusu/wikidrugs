Pheniramine may cause drowsiness or [[bradycardia]], and over-dosage may lead to sleep disorders.

 


 
Overdose may lead to [[seizures]], especially in combination with alcohol.

 


 
People combining with [[cortisol]] in the long term should avoid pheniramine as it may decrease levels of adrenaline (epinephrine) which may lead to loss of consciousness.

 


 
Pheniramine is a [[deliriant]] (hallucinogen) in toxic doses. Recreational use of Robitussin for the [[dissociative]] (hallucinogenic) effect of its dextromethorphan is hazardous because it also contains chlorpheniramine.
