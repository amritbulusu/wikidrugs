* [[Lymphopenia]] : Most common in clinical trials was a significant and dose-related reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ counts in 10 to 59% of patients. However, only 0 to 2% of patients experienced reductions below the accepted lower limit. Consequences of lymphopenia may be infections and/or treatment related malignancies (see below).

 
* Malignancies : In clinical studies among 1,869 patients 63 treatment-emerged malignancies in 43 patients were observed. Most of these were [[nonmelanoma]] and [[melanoma]] [[skin cancer]]s, other [[solid tumor]]s, and [[lymphoma]]s.

 
* Infections : In clinical studies 0.9% of patients experienced significant infections compared to 0.2% in the placebo group. Among the infections were serious ones such as [[sepsis]], [[pneumonia]], [[abscess]]es, [[wound infection]]s and [[toxic shock syndrome]].

 
* Sensitivity reactions: [[Urticaria]] and [[angioedema]] were observed. If an [[anaphylactic reaction]] should occur symptomatic treatment should be initiated at once.

 
* Forming of [[antibody|antibodies]] to alefacept : About 3% of patients developed low-titer antibodies with unknown importance for the clinical efficiency of the drug. Long-term immune effects have not been well explored.

 
* Hepatic Toxicity : Postmarketing reports revealed asymtomatic increases in [[transaminases]] ([[alanine transaminase|ALT]] and/or [[aspartate transaminase|AST]]), [[fatty liver degeneration]], decompensation of preexisting [[liver cirrhosis]], and acute treatment-related [[liver failure]]. It is not known if some or all of these manifestations are attributable to alefacept-therapy, but it is recommended to discontinue therapy as soon as any sign of liver toxicity develops.

 
* Different Common Side Effects : side effects such as [[pharyngitis]], [[cough]], [[dizziness]], [[nausea]], [[pruritus]], [[myalgia]]s, [[Rigor (medicine)|chills]], and reactions at injection sites were observed quite frequently.
