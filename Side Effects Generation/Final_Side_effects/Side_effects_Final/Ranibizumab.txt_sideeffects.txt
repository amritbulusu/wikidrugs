A 2014 Cochrane review did not find a difference between bevacizumab and ranibizumab in deaths or total severe side effects when used for macular degeneration.<ref name=Moja2014>{{cite journal|last1=Moja|first1=L|last2=Lucenteforte|first2=E|last3=Kwag|first3=KH|last4=Bertele|first4=V|last5=Campomori|first5=A|last6=Chakravarthy|first6=U|last7=D'Amico|first7=R|last8=Dickersin|first8=K|last9=Kodjikian|first9=L|last10=Lindsley|first10=K|last11=Loke|first11=Y|last12=Maguire|first12=M|last13=Martin|first13=DF|last14=Mugelli|first14=A|last15=Mühlbauer|first15=B|last16=Püntmann|first16=I|last17=Reeves|first17=B|last18=Rogers|first18=C|last19=Schmucker|first19=C|last20=Subramanian|first20=ML|last21=Virgili|first21=G|title=Systemic safety of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Sep 15, 2014|volume=9|pages=CD011230|pmid=25220133|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011230.pub2|pmc=4262120}}</ref> There; however, was not a lot of evidence and thus this conclusion is not that certain.<ref name=Moja2014/>

 


 
Ranibizumab does appear to result in a lower risk of stomach and intestinal problems.<ref name=Moja2014/> It is also associated with a low rate of eye related side effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmucker|first1=C|last2=Ehlken|first2=C|last3=Agostini|first3=HT|last4=Antes|first4=G|last5=Ruecker|first5=G|last6=Lelgemann|first6=M|last7=Loke|first7=YK|title=A safety review and meta-analyses of bevacizumab and ranibizumab: off-label versus goldstandard.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=e42701|pmid=22880086|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042701|pmc=3411814}}</ref>

 


 
The most common side effects in clinical trials were conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous [[floater]]s, increased [[intraocular pressure]], and intraocular inflammation.

 


 
Although there is a theoretical risk for arterial thromboembolic events in people receiving VEGF-inhibitors by intravitreal injection, the observed incidence rate was low (< 4%) and similar to that seen with placebo.

 


 
Serious adverse events related to the injection procedure occurred with an incidence rate of less than 1% and included [[endophthalmitis]], [[retinal detachment]], and traumatic [[cataract]]s. Other serious ocular adverse events observed among ranibizumab-treated patients (incidence rate < 1%) included intraocular inflammation and blindness.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}</ref>
