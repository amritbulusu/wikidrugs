Tolcapone has demonstrated significant [[liver toxicity]] (hepatotoxicity)<ref name="pmid17909307">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/wnf.0b013e318038d2b6 | title = Tolcapone | year = 2007 | last1 = Olanow | first1 = C.

Entacapone is an alternative, largely since it has a more favorable toxicity profile.

 


 
The hepatotoxicity can be related to elevated levels of [[transaminase]]s, but studies have shown that minimal risk exists for those without preexisting liver conditions when their enzyme levels were being monitored. No clear mechanism is implicated, but it has been hypothesized that it has something to do with abnormal [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] respiration due to the uncoupling of [[oxidative phosphorylation]].<ref name="ncbi_b">{{cite journal | last1 = Truong | first1 = D. | title = Tolcapone: Review of its pharmacology and use as adjunctive therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease | journal = Clinical Interventions in Aging | year = 2009 | volume = 4 | pages = 109–113 | doi = 10.2147/CIA.S3787 | pmid = 19503773 | pmc = 2685232 }}</ref> 

 


 
Other side effects regard the increase in dopaminergic activity, including digestive symptoms.<ref name="EMA" /> Treatment with tolcapone runs the risk of eliciting or prolonging [[dyskinesia]]; this can be counteracted by decreasing the dose of levodopa. This occurs because the administration of tolcapone results in the accumulation of the biological methyl donor [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl-<small>L</small>-methionine]] (SAM) in the [[striatum]] that induces Parkinson symptoms.<ref name="ncbi_b" />

 


 
Digestive symptoms include [[nausea]] and [[diarrhea]]; further dopaminergic side effects include [[orthostatic hypotension]], dry mouth, sweating and dizziness.  Tolcapone causes more severe diarrhea than entacapone; this was the most common reason for therapy termination in studies.<ref name="Dinnendahl" /> Urine discoloration comes from yellow tolcapone [[metabolite]]s being excreted in the urine and is harmless.<ref name="EMA" /><ref name="ncbi_b" />
