Toxicity may include interstitial [[pulmonary fibrosis]] ("busulfan lung"), [[hyperpigmentation]], [[seizures]], hepatic ([[veno-occlusive disease]]) (VOD), emesis, and [[wasting syndrome]]. Busulfan also induces [[thrombocytopenia]], a condition of lowered blood [[platelet]] count and activity.  Seizures and VOD are serious concerns with busulfan therapy and prophylaxis is often utilized to avoid these effects.  Hepatic VOD is a dose-limiting toxicity.

 


 
Antiemetics are often administered prior to busulfan to prevent emesis.

 


 
[[Phenytoin]] may be used concurrently to prevent the seizures. [[Levetiracetam]], has shown efficacy for the prophylaxis against busulfan-induced seizures. Benzodiazepines can also be used for busulfan-induced seizures.<ref name="Eberly-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Eberly | first1 = AL. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = GD. | last3 = Bubalo | first3 = JS. | last4 = McCune | first4 = JS. | title = Optimal prevention of seizures induced by high-dose busulfan. | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 12 | pages = 1502â€“10 |date=Dec 2008 | doi = 10.1592/phco.28.12.1502 | pmid = 19025431 }}</ref>

 


 
Ursodiol may be considered for prophylaxis of veno-occlusive disease.

 


 
Busulfan is listed by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] as a Group 1 [[carcinogen]].
