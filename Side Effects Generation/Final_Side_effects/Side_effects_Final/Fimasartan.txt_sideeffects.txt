Side effects

 
In clinical trials, fimasartan was well tolerated in all patients. However, higher dosing (360&nbsp;mg/day) was accompanied by increased dizziness (most likely due to the momentary decrease in blood pressure) and headaches in a low number of patients.<ref name="tolerability" /> Other side effects such as diarrhea, syncope, and cold feet were also experienced in a low number of subjects, which all resolved without medical intervention.<ref name="tolerability" />
