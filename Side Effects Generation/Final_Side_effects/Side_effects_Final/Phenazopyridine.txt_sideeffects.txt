[[File:Pyridiumurine.jpg|thumb|The characteristic orange-colored urine after taking Pyridium]]

 
Phenazopyridine produces a vivid color change in urine, typically to a dark orange to reddish color. This effect is common and harmless, and indeed a key indicator of the presence of the medication in the body. Users of phenazopyridine are warned not to wear contact lenses, as phenazopyridine has been known to permanently discolor contact lenses and fabrics.<ref name=wcrx.com /><ref name="medline">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682231.html{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref> Some may be mistakenly concerned that this indicated blood in the urine.

 


 
Phenazopyridine can also cause [[headache]]s, [[upset stomach]] (especially when not taken with food), or [[dizziness]]. Less frequently it can cause a pigment change in the skin or eyes, to a noticeable yellowish color. This is due to a depressed excretion via the kidneys causing a buildup of the medication in the skin, and normally indicates a need to discontinue usage.<ref name=dailymed /> Other such side effects include [[fever]], [[confusion]], [[shortness of breath]], [[skin]] [[rash]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the face, fingers, feet, or legs.<ref name=wcrx.com /><ref name=dailymed /> Long-term use may cause yellowing of nails.<ref>{{Cite journal | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine |date=15 December 1997 | volume = 127 | page = 1137 | type = letter | title = Lemon-yellow nails and long-term phenazopyridine use | last1 = Amit | first1 = G | last2 = Halkin | first2 = A | pmid = 9412335 | issue = 12 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-127-12-199712150-00040}}</ref>
