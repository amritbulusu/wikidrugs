Primary bile acids are produced by the [[liver]] and stored in the [[gall bladder]]. When secreted into the intestine, primary bile acids can be metabolized into secondary bile acids by intestinal bacteria. Primary and secondary bile acids help the body [[digestion|digest]] [[fat]]s.  Ursodeoxycholic acid helps regulate [[cholesterol]] by reducing the rate at which the [[intestine]] absorbs cholesterol molecules while breaking up [[micelle]]s containing cholesterol.  Because of this property, ursodeoxycholic acid is used to treat (cholesterol) [[gallstone]]s non-surgically. It is also used to relieve itching in pregnancy for some women who suffer obstetric cholestasis.

 


 
While some bile acids are known to be colon tumor promoters (e.g. deoxycholic acid), others such as ursodeoxycholic acid are thought to be [[Chemoprophylaxis|chemopreventive]], perhaps by inducing cellular differentiation and/or cellular senescence in colon epithelial cells.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Akare S, Jean-Louis S, Chen W, Wood DJ, Powell AA, Martinez JD |title=Ursodeoxycholic acid modulates histone acetylation and induces differentiation and senescence |journal=International Journal of Cancer.

Ursodeoxycholic acid has also been shown experimentally to suppress [[immune system|immune response]] such as immune cell [[phagocytosis]].  Prolonged exposure and/or increased quantities of systemic (throughout the body, not just in the digestive system) ursodeoxycholic acid can be toxic.<ref>Material Safety Data Sheet on Ursodiol MSDS. https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/70916.htm</ref>
