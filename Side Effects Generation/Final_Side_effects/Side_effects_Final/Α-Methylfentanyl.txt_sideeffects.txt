α-Methylfentanyl has similar effects to [[fentanyl]]. It is less potent by weight due to reduced binding affinity to its [[Mu opioid receptor|target]] site, yet longer acting as the α-methyl group interferes with binding to metabolic enzymes which break the drug down. The independent discovery of the effect of the α-methyl group on fentanyl also marked the first time clandestine recreational-drug research had an effect on practical scientific research.<ref>[http://opioids.com/ohmefentanyl/structure.html Ohmefentanyl]</ref>

 


 
Since fentanyl itself is highly potent and notorious for causing fatal overdoses when abused, and also very short lasting with recreational users often administering doses every hour, α-methylfentanyl could have several advantages over the parent compound as a recreational drug. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]] (namely with overdoses or improper drug-combinations, such as with [[benzodiazepines]]) which can be life-threatening.<ref>[http://zakonsteroid.com/zhiroszhigateli-efedrin/402-china-white-25-100caps.html China White]</ref>

 


 
Fentanyl analogs such as α-methylfentanyl and [[3-methylfentanyl]] are often used as the "cut" in small amounts in normal heroin stamps and bags, making them more potent and profitable when sold as heroin alone due to the advantage of raising the retail price and potency per unit sold.
