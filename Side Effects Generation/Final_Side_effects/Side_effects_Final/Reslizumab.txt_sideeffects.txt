The most common adverse effect of reslizumab was oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) pain. According to the phase III clinical trials data, oropharyngeal pain occurred in â‰¥2% of individuals along with elevated baseline creatine phosphokinase (CPK), which was more common in patients treated with reslizumab versus placebo. Myalgia was also reported more in patients in the reslizumab 3 mg/kg group versus the placebo group as well as some musculoskeletal adverse reactions. Lastly, some serious adverse reactions that occurred in subjects treated with reslizumab but not in those treated with placebo included anaphylaxis and malignancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2016/761033Orig1s000Lbl.pdff |format=PDF |title=CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH : APPLICATION NUMBER : 761033Orig1s000 |website=Accessdata.fda.gov |accessdate=2016-11-22}}</ref>
