Stimulants in therapeutic doses, such as those given to patients with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], increases ability to focus, vigor, sociability, libido and may elevate mood.  However, in higher doses stimulants may actually decrease the ability to focus, a principle of the [[Yerkes-Dodson Law]].  In higher doses stimulants may also produce euphoria, vigor, and decrease need for sleep.  Many, but not all, stimulants have [[ergogenic]] effects.  Drugs such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine and methylphenidate have well documented ergogenic effects, while drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine have the opposite effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Avois|first1=L|last2=Robinson|first2=N|last3=Saudan|first3=C|last4=Baume|first4=N|last5=Mangin|first5=P|last6=Saugy|first6=M|title=Central nervous system stimulants and sport practice|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|date=7 January 2017|volume=40|issue=Suppl 1|pages=i16–i20|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.027557|pmc=2657493|issn=0306-3674}}</ref>  Neurocognitive enhancing effects of stimulants, specifically [[modafinil]], amphetamine and methylphenidate have been documented in healthy adolescents, and is a commonly cited reason among illicit drug users for use, particularly among college students in the context of studying.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bagot|first1=Kara Simone|last2=Kaminer|first2=Yifrah|title=Efficacy of stimulants for cognitive enhancement in non-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder youth: a systematic review|journal=Addiction |date=1 April 2014|volume=109|issue=4|pages=547–557|pmid=24749160|issn=1360-0443}}</ref>

 


 
In some cases psychiatric phenomenon may emerge such as [[stimulant psychosis]], [[paranoia]], and [[suicidal ideation]].  Acute toxicity has been reportedly associated with a homicide, paranoia, aggressive behavior, motor dysfunction, and [[punding]].  The violent and aggressive behavior associated with acute stimulant toxicity may partially be driven by paranoia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=W.

This leads to effects such as [[mydriasis]], increased heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and body temperature.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Treatment|first1=Center for Substance Abuse|title=Chapter 2—How Stimulants Affect the Brain and Behavior|date=1 January 1999|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64328/|publisher=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (US)|language=en}}</ref>  When these changes become pathological, they are called [[arrhythmia]], [[hypertension]], and [[hyperthermia]], and may lead to [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[stroke]], [[cardiac arrest]], or [[seizures]].  However given the complexity of the mechanisms that underly these potentially fatal outcomes of acute stimulant toxicity, it is impossible to determine what dose may be lethal.<ref>{{cite book|title=Treatment for Stimulant Use Disorders.Chapter 5—Medical Aspects of Stimulant Use Disorders|publisher=Center for Substance Abuse Treatment.
