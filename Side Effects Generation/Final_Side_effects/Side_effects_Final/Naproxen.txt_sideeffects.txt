 
Naproxen should be taken orally with food to decrease the risk of [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] side effects. Common adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rash, bruising, and gastrointestinal upset.<ref name=drugs/>

 


 
In the U.S., naproxen is sold with [[boxed warning]]s about the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding.<ref name=drugs/>

 


 
[[COX-2]] selective and nonselective [[NSAIDs]] have been linked to increases in the number of serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular events, such as [[myocardial infarctions]] and [[stroke]]s.<ref name="NissenYeomans2016">{{cite journal|last1=Nissen|first1=Steven E.|last2=Yeomans|first2=Neville D.|last3=Solomon|first3=Daniel H.|last4=Lüscher|first4=Thomas F.|last5=Libby|first5=Peter|last6=Husni|first6=M.

A study found that high-dose naproxen induced near-complete suppression of platelet [[thromboxane]] throughout the dosing interval and appeared not to increase [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) risk, whereas other non-aspirin high-dose NSAID regimens had only transient effects on platelet [[COX-1]] and were associated with a small but definite vascular hazard. Conversely, naproxen was associated with higher rates of upper gastrointestinal bleeding complications compared with other NSAIDs.<ref name=j1/>
