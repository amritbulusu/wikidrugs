[[Central nervous system]] [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s are quite frequently noted and encompass speech and visual disturbances, mental depression and confusion, hallucinations, headache, insomnia and exacerbation or precipitation of seizures, and increased nervousness. Infrequent cases of respiratory depression or a feeling of suffocation have been observed. Dantrolene often causes sedation severe enough to incapacitate the patient to drive or operate machinery.

 


 
Gastrointestinal effects include bad taste, [[anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]], nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.

 


 
Liver side effects may be seen either as asymptomatic elevation of [[liver enzyme]]s and/or [[bilirubin]] or, most severe, as fatal and nonfatal [[hepatitis|liver inflammation]]. The risk of liver inflammation is associated with the duration of treatment and the daily dose. In patients treated for hyperthermia, no liver toxicity has been observed so far.

 


 
[[Pleural effusion]] with [[pericarditis|inflammation of the fibrous sac around the heart]] (oral treatment only), rare cases of [[Myelosuppression|bone marrow damage]], diffuse [[myalgia|muscle pains]], backache, dermatologic reactions, transient cardiovascular reactions, and [[crystalluria|crystals in the urine]] have additionally been seen.  Muscle weakness may persist for several days following treatment.
