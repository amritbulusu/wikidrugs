In clinical trials for [[ischemic stroke]], ancrod increased the risk of intracebrral hemorrhage.<ref name=Cochrane2012/>

 


 
* Hypersensitivity reactions : Local or generalized [[skin reactions]] ([[rash]] and [[urticaria]]); appearance of neutralizing [[antibodies]] to ancrod with partial or total loss of ancrod activity (drug resistance).

 
* Sometimes pain at injection site (normally mild). This side effect may be, if necessary, treated with local or oral [[antihistaminic]] drugs (e.g., [[clemastine]], or [[diphenhydramine]]). Bleeding at injection site, [[thrombophlebitis]] at local veins, and (paradoxical) arterial thrombotic events.

 
* Occasionally deposition of cleaved fibrinogen derivates in the spleen resulting in [[splenomegaly]]; rupture is possible, if the [[spleen]] is palpated too strongly (life-threatening bleeding and need of [[splenectomy]] may result).

 
* Specific side effects are local and systemic bleeding events. Local bleeding events may be treated with local pressure or [[surgical dressings]], if necessary. Compared with other anticoagulants the risk of systemic bleeding is relatively low. If systemic bleeding is severe enough to warrant fast reversal of ancrod action, fibrinogen should be substituted (please refer to section 'special antidotes').

 
* Occasionally, increased headache has been found in patients with known [[migraine]].

 
* Also, [[chills]] and [[fever]] may occur infrequently.

 


 
[[Thrombocytopenia]] as side effect has never been noticed with ancrod in contrast to heparin.
