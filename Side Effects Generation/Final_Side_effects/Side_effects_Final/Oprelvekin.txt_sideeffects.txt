Neumega has caused allergic reaction which at times have been very serious. Symptoms have been [[edema]] of the face and tongue, or [[larynx]]; shortness of breath; [[wheezing]]; chest pain; [[hypotension]] (including [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]); dysarthria; loss of consciousness, [[rash]], [[urticaria]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], and [[fever]]. These reaction can occur after the first dose or after any later application. Neumega should be permanently discontinued in patients with any sign of allergy. Treatment is largely symptomatic.

 


 
Oprelvekin also has caused quite often fluid retention, ranging from peripheral [[edema]] (approximately 40% of patients) to [[dyspnea]] and full developed [[lung edema]] with or without cardiac decompensation (see contraindications and precautions). These symptoms have led to some deaths. Fluid retention my also lead to dilutional anemia (in 10 to 15% of patients). Hypokalemia my also result. Symptoms of fluid retention have been observed more often in patients following [[myeloablative chemotherapy]] (see contraindications). Severe arrhythmias ([[atrial flutter]] and [[atrial fibrillation]]) as well as fatal [[cardiac arrest]] have also been seen which may or may be not attributed to fluid retention/increased volume. Isolated cases of [[stroke]] have been noted, those patients with previous transient ischemic attacks or partial/minor strokes may be at particular risk.

 


 
[[Papilledema]] of the eyes has been observed (2%) and may lead to disturbed [[visual acuity]] and even temporary or permanent [[blindness]]. Patients with preexisting papilledema or with involvement of the central nervous system may be at higher risk.

 


 
In postmarketing studies isolated cases of severe [[ventricular arrhythmias]] and [[renal failure]] have been seen.

 


 
Injection site reaction like have also been observed (dermatitis, pain, and discoloration), but are usually mild.
