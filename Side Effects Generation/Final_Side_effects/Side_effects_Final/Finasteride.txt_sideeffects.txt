A 2015 meta analysis found that none of the clinical trials testing finasteride in hair loss had adequate safety reporting and did not provide sufficient information to establish the safety profile for finasteride as a treatment for hair loss. The study concluded the existing clinical trials of finasteride for hair loss provide very limited information on toxicity, are of poor quality, and seem to be systematically biased toward under-detection of adverse events. Moreover, the trials submitted to the FDA for approval for hair loss excluded most men who would normally be prescribed finasteride for androgenic alopecia.<ref name=Belknapp>{{cite journal | vauthors = Belknap SM, Aslam I, Kiguradze T, Temps WH, Yarnold PR, Cashy J, Brannigan RE, Micali G, Nardone B, West DP | title = Adverse Event Reporting in Clinical Trials of Finasteride for Androgenic Alopecia: A Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA Dermatology | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 600–6 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25830296 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.36 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore TJ | title = Finasteride and the Uncertainties of Establishing Harms | journal = JAMA Dermatology | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 585–6 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25831198 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.37 }}</ref>
