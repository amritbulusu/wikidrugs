Metamizole has a potential of haematologic (blood-related) toxicity (blood [[dyscrasia]]s), but causes less [[renal|kidney]], [[cardiovascular]], and GI toxicity than [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs).<ref name = deranaes2008/> Like NSAIDs, it can trigger bronchospasm or [[anaphylaxis]], especially in those with [[asthma]].<ref name=deranaes2004>{{cite journal |last1=Brack |first1=A |last2=Rittner |first2=HL |last3=Schäfer |first3=M|title=Nichtopioidanalgetika zur perioperativen Schmerztherapie |trans_title=Non-opioid analgesics for perioperative pain therapy.

Serious side effects include [[agranulocytosis]], [[aplastic anaemia]], hypersensitivity reactions (like [[anaphylaxis]] and [[bronchospasm]]), [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] and it may provoke acute attacks of [[porphyria]], as it is chemically related to the [[sulfonamide]]s.<ref name = MD/><ref name = deranaes2008/><ref name = deranaes2004/> The relative risk for agranulocytosis appears to greatly vary according to the country of estimates on said rate and opinion on the risk is strongly divided.<ref name = MD/><ref name=CurrOpAnesth2014rev>Pogatzki-Zahn E, Chandrasena C, Schug SA.
