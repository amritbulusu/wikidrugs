The most common [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of diacerein treatment are [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] symptoms including soft stools and [[diarrhea]].<ref>Pavelka K, Bruyere O, Cooper C, et al.

Based on review by European Medicines Agency (EMA), diacerein-containing medicines use is restricted due to severe diarrhoea and liver disorders in patients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panova|first=Elena|last2=Jones|first2=Graeme|date=March 2015|title=Benefit-risk assessment of diacerein in the treatment of osteoarthritis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25652235|journal=Drug Safety|volume=38|issue=3|pages=245â€“252|doi=10.1007/s40264-015-0266-z|issn=1179-1942|pmid=25652235}}</ref>

 


 
An uncommon side effect is hepatic adverse events (most frequently reported as liver function test abnormalities). These have been described as mild/moderate cases of elevated liver enzymes in the blood.

 


 
Mild skin reactions (rash, pruritus and eczema) have also been reported with diacerein treatment. 

 


 
Discoloration of urine (yellow or pink) is another side effect of diacerein. This effect is due to the elimination of rhein metabolites via the urine and no clinical significance has been found; it may also be dependent on general fluid intake.
