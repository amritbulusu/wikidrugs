The principal [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of the cephalosporins is hypersensitivity.  Penicillin-sensitive patients will also be allergic to the cephalosporins, depending on the cephalosporin generation.  The previous percentage of 10% cross reactivity rates are often overestimated.  Allergic reactions may present as, for example, rashes, [[pruritus]] (itching), [[urticaria]], [[serum sickness-like reaction]]s with rashes, fever and [[arthralgia]], and [[anaphylaxis]]. The frequency and severity of [[serum sickness]]-like reactions in children has led researchers to question its role in pediatric illness.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=King BA, Geelhoed GC |title=Adverse skin and joint reactions associated with oral antibiotics in children: the role of cefaclor in serum sickness-like reactions |journal=J Paediatr Child Health |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=677–81 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14629499 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1034-4810&date=2003&volume=39&issue=9&spage=677 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1754.2003.00267.x}}</ref> [[File:Allergy to Antibiotic Cefaclor.JPG|thumb|Skin Allergy to Cefaclor|300px|left]] Other side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, disturbances in liver enzymes, transient [[hepatitis]] and cholestatic jaundice), [[headache]], and [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]. Rare side effects include [[eosinophilia]] and blood disorders (including [[thrombocytopenia]], [[leucopenia]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[aplastic anaemia]] and [[haemolytic anaemia]]); reversible [[interstitial nephritis]]; [[hyperactivity]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], sleep disturbances, [[hallucinations]], [[confusion]], [[hypertonia]], and [[dizziness]]. [[Toxic epidermal necrolysis]] has been reported. In the UK, The Committee on the Safety of Medicines ([[Committee on Safety of Medicines|CSM]]) has warned that the risk of diarrhea and rarely antibiotic-associated colitis are more likely with higher doses.
