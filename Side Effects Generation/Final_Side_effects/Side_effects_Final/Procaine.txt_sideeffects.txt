Application of procaine leads to the depression of neuronal activity. The depression causes the nervous system to become hypersensitive, producing restlessness and shaking, leading to minor to severe convulsions. Studies on animals have shown the use of procaine led to the increase of [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] levels in the brain.<ref>Sawaki, K., and Kawaguchim, M. "Some Correlations between procaine-induced convulsions and monoamides in the spinal cord of rats". Japanese Journal of Pharmacology,51(3), 1989, p. 369-376.</ref>  Other issues may occur because of varying individual tolerance to procaine dosage. Nervousness and dizziness can arise from the excitation of the central nervous system, which may lead to respiratory failure if overdosed. Procaine may also induce weakening of the [[myocardium]] leading to [[cardiac arrest]].<ref>http://www.drugs.com/pro/novocain.html - Novocain Official FDA information. Updated(08/2007)</ref>

 


 
Procaine can also cause allergic reactions causing individuals to have problems with breathing, rashes, and swelling. Allergic reactions to procaine are usually not in response to procaine itself, but to its metabolite PABA. About one in 3000 white North Americans is homozygotic (i.e. has two copies of the abnormal gene) for the most common atypical form of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase,<ref name=OMIM_BCh>{{cite web|title=BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE|url=http://www.omim.org/entry/177400|website=OMIM|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref> and do not hydrolyze ester anesthetics such as procaine. This results in a prolonged period of high levels of the anesthetic in the blood and increased toxicity. However, certain populations in the world such as the Vysya community in India commonly have a deficiency of this enzyme.<ref name=OMIM_BCh />
