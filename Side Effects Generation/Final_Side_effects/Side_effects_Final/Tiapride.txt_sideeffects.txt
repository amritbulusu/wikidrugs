Although it is considered a "safe" medicine, it is, like sulpiride, strictly contraindicated for patients under the age of 18 due to its effects during the process of puberty. This is likely related to its side effects on levels of the hormone prolactin, which is involved in sexual development.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanford|first=LM|author2=Baker, SJ |title=Prolactin regulation of testosterone secretion and testes growth in DLS rams at the onset of seasonal testicular recrudescence.|journal=Reproduction (Cambridge, England)|date=January 2010|volume=139|issue=1|pages=197–207|pmid=19755483|doi=10.1530/REP-09-0180}}</ref> There are also insufficient clinical data on the other side effects in adolescents.

 


 
Tiapride has been found to cause [[Hyperprolactinaemia|excess prolactin]] levels in plasma,<ref name=perenyi /> which can cause decreased [[libido]], [[infertility]] and increased risk of [[breast cancer]].<ref name=AET>{{cite web|title=Tiacob: Summary of Product Characteristics|publisher=A.E. Tiefenbacher|accessdate=22 October 2012|year=2006}}</ref> This is because dopamine plays a primary role in regulating prolactin release by binding to D<sub>2</sub> receptors on [[Prolactin cell|prolactin-secreting cells]] in the anterior pituitary.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=P|author2=Dinan, TG |title=Prolactin and dopamine: what is the connection?

The side-effect reported most commonly to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is [[rhabdomyolysis]], a condition characterized by muscle tissue breakdown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiapride Hydrochloride|url=http://www.drugcite.com/?q=TIAPRIDE%20HYDROCHLORIDE|publisher=DrugCite|accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> Cardiac abnormalities such as prolongation of the [[QT interval]] and [[torsades de pointes]] have also been observed.<ref name=AET />

 


 
Dosages above approximately 300&nbsp;mg/day risk inducing tardive dyskinesia.<ref name=peters /> However, given the drug's fairly wide window of tolerable doses,<ref name=scatton /> dosages can often be titrated to obtain the desired effect without bringing about motor deficits. In general, tiapride is considered an [[atypical antipsychotic]] because of its low risk for [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], such as [[akinesia]] and [[akathesia]]. These effects are thought to be reduced in tiapride relative to [[typical antipsychotics]] because of its selectivity for the limbic system over extrapyramidal areas that control movement.<ref name=scatton />
