In the 1930s, estrone was given via intramuscular injection to [[ovariectomy|ovariectomized]] women in order to study its effects and to elucidate the [[function (biology)|biological properties]] of estrogens in humans.<ref name="Werner1932">{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=A.

Breast changes specifically included [[breast enlargement|enlargement]] and a sense of [[breast fullness|fullness]], increased [[nipple sensitivity|sensitivity]] and [[pigmentation]] of the nipples as well as [[nipple erection]], [[paresthesia|tingling]] within the breast [[mammary gland|mammary glandular]] tissue, and [[breast pain|aching and soreness]] of the breasts.<ref name="Werner1932" /><ref name="WernerCollier1933" /><ref name="Werner1937" /> [[Reproductive tract]] changes included increased [[cell growth|growth]], thickness, and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of the endometrium, and reversal of vaginal and cervical atrophy, which were accompanied by increased [[water retention (medicine)|congestion]] of the cervix and [[vaginal discharge|mucous discharge]] from the cervix, uterine [[cramp]]s and [[paresthesia|needle-like pains]], pelvic fullness, a "bearing-down" sensation, and increased [[vaginal lubrication]], as well as [[uterine bleeding]] both during treatment and in the days following cessation of injections.<ref name="Werner1932" /><ref name="WernerCollier1933" /><ref name="Werner1937" /> [[Endometrial hyperplasia]] also occurred with sufficiently high dosages of estrone.<ref name="Werner1932" /><ref name="WernerCollier1933" /><ref name="Werner1937" />
