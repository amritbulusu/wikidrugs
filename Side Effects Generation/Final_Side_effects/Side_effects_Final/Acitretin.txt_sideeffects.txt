Acitretin is noted for the possibility of severe birth defects and should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant within 3 years following the use of acitretin.  Sexually active women of childbearing age who use acitretin should also use at least two forms of birth control concurrently. Men and women who use it should not donate blood for three years after using it, because of the possibility that the blood might be used in a pregnant patient and cause birth defects.  In addition, it may cause nausea, headache, itching, dry, red or flaky skin, dry or red eyes, dry or chapped lips, swollen lips, dry mouth, thirst, cystitis acne or hair loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-4719-soriatane+oral.aspx?drugid=4719&drugname=soriatane+oral|title=Soriatane|work=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/soriatane-side-effects.html|title=Soriatane Side Effects|work=[[Drugs.com]]|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/soriatane-drug.htm|title=Soriatane (Acitretin) Drug Information: Description, User Reviews, Drug Side Effects, Interactions - Prescribing Information at RxList|work=[[RxList]]|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>
