Without intervention, [[acetylcholine| acetylcholine (ACh)]] in the peripheral nervous system activates skeletal muscles. Acetylcholine is produced in the body of the neuron by [[choline acetyltransferase]] and transported down the axon to the synaptic gap. Tubocurarine chloride acts as an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] for the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor| nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChr)]], meaning it blocks the receptor site from ACh.<ref name="pmid11562442">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wenningmann I, Dilger JP |title=The kinetics of inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by (+)-tubocurarine and pancuronium |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=790–6 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11562442 |doi= |url=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11562442}}</ref> This may be due to the quaternary amino structural motif found on both molecules.
