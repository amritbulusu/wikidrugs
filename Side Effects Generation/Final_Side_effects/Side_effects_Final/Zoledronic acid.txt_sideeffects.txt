Side effects can include [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anemia]], [[muscle pain|muscle aches]], [[fever]], and/or [[Edema|swelling]] in the feet or legs. [[Flu-like symptoms]] are commonly experienced after the first zoledronate infusion, although not subsequent infusions, and are thought to occur because of its potential to activate human [[γδ T cells]] (gamma/delta T cells).

 


 
There is a risk of severe renal impairment. Appropriate [[Rehydration|hydration]] is important prior to administration, as is adequate [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] intake prior to Aclasta therapy in patients with preexisting [[hypocalcaemia]], and for ten days following Aclasta in patients with Paget's disease of the bone. Monitoring for other mineral metabolism disorders and the avoidance of invasive dental procedures for those who develop [[osteonecrosis of the jaw]] is recommended.<ref>http://www.nps.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/60945/nvcaclin.pdf</ref>

 


 
Zoledronate is rapidly processed via the [[kidney]]s; consequently its administration is not recommended for patients with reduced [[renal function]] or kidney disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emc.medicines.org.uk/medicine/14062/SPC/Zometa+4mg+5ml+Concentrate+for+Solution+for+Infusion/|title=Zometa 4mg/5ml Concentrate for Solution for Infusion|work=medicines.org.uk}}</ref> Some cases of acute renal failure either requiring dialysis or having a fatal outcome following Reclast use have been reported to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/fda/reclast-zoledronic-acid-safety-communication-new-updated-warning-kidney-impairment-13020.html|title=FDA Alert: Reclast (zoledronic acid): Drug Safety Communication - New Contraindication and Updated Warning on Kidney Impairment|work=drugs.com}}</ref> This assessment was confirmed by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA), whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) specified new contraindications for the medication on 15 December 2011, which include hypocalcaemia and severe renal impairment with a [[creatinine]] clearance of less than 35 ml/min.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000595/smops/Positive/human_smop_000319.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d127|title=European Medicines Agency - Human medicines|work=europa.eu}}</ref>

 


 
A rare complication that has been recently observed in cancer patients being treated with bisphosphonates is [[osteonecrosis of the jaw]].  This has mainly been seen in patients with [[multiple myeloma]] treated with zoledronate who have had [[dental extraction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Durie BG, Katz M, Crowley J |title=Osteonecrosis of the jaw and bisphosphonates |journal=N.

After approving the drug on 8 July 2009, the [[European Medicines Agency]] conducted a class review of all [[bisphosphonates]], including Zoledronate, after several cases of atypical fractures were reported.<ref name="ema.europa.eu">{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/public_health_alerts/2011/04/human_pha_detail_000027.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d126|title=European Medicines Agency - Human medicines|work=europa.eu}}</ref> In 2008, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) noted that [[alendronic acid]] was associated with an increased risk of atypical fracture of the [[femur]] that developed with low or no trauma. In April 2010, the PhVWP noted that further data from both the published literature and post-marketing reports were now available which suggested that atypical stress fractures of the femur may be a class effect. The [[European Medicines Agency]] then reviewed all case reports of stress fractures in patients treated with bisphosphonates, relevant data from the published literature, and data provided by the companies which market bisphosphonates. The Agency recommended that doctors who prescribe bisphosphonate-containing medicines should be aware that atypical fractures may occur rarely in the femur, especially after long-term use, and that doctors who are prescribing these medicines for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis should regularly review the need for continued treatment, especially after five or more years of use.<ref name="ema.europa.eu"/>
