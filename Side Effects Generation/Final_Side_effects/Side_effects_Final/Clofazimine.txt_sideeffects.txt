Clofazimine produces pink to brownish skin pigmentation in 75-100% of patients within a few weeks, as well as similar discoloration of most bodily fluids and secretions. These discolorations are reversible but may take months to years to disappear. There is evidence in medical literature that as a result of clofazimine administration, several patients have developed [[Depression (mood)|depression]] which in some cases resulted in suicide. It has been hypothesized that the depression was a result of this chronic skin discoloration.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown, Stoudemire|title=Psychiatric Side Effects of Prescription and Over-the-counter Medications: Recognition and Management|date=1998|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K7kevbILCuQC&pg=RA2-PA1985&dq=clofazimine+suicide&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=clofazimine%20suicide&f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024758/https://books.google.ca/books?id=K7kevbILCuQC&pg=RA2-PA1985&dq=clofazimine+suicide&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=clofazimine%20suicide&f=false|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}</ref>
