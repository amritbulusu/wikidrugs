Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) associated with the use of sevelamer include: [[hypotension]], [[hypertension]], nausea and vomiting, [[dyspepsia]], [[diarrhea]], [[flatulence]], and/or [[constipation]].

 


 
Sevelamer can significantly reduce serum [[uric acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garg JP, Chasan-Taber S, Blair A, etal | title = Effects of sevelamer and calcium-based phosphate binders on uric acid concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a randomized clinical trial| journal = Arthritis and rheumatism | volume = 52| issue = 1| pages = 290â€“5|date=January 2005| pmid = 15641045| doi = 10.1002/art.20781| url = | issn = }}</ref> This reduction has no known detrimental effect and several beneficial effects, including reducing [[hyperuricemia]], [[uric acid nephrolithiasis]], and [[gout]].

 


 
Sevelamer is able to sequester advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the gut,  preventing their absorption into the blood. AGEs contribute to [[oxidative stress]], which can damage cells (like [[beta cell|beta cells]], which produce [[insulin]] in the [[pancreas]]). As Vlassara and Uribarri explain in a 2014 review on AGEs, this may explain why sevelamer, but not [[calcium carbonate]] (a phosphate binder that ''does not'' sequester AGEs), has been shown to lower AGEs in the blood, as well as oxidative stress and [[acute-phase protein|inflammatory markers]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlassara H, Uribarri J | title = Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE) and Diabetes: Cause, Effect, or Both? | journal = J.
