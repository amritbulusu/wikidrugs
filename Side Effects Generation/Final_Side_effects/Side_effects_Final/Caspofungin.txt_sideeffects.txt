Compared to amphotericin B, caspofungin seems to have a relatively low incidence of side effects. In clinical studies and postmarketing reports, the side effects seen in 1% or more of the patients were as follows:

 


 
* [[Gastrointestinal system]]: [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[abdominal pain]], and [[diarrhea]]

 
* [[Central nervous system]]: [[headache]]

 
* Whole body: [[fever]], [[phlebitis]] or thrombophlebitis, complications at the [[intravenous cannulation]] site (e.g. induration), unspecified pain, [[flu-like syndrome]], myalgia, chills, and [[paresthesia]]

 
* [[Respiratory]]: [[dyspnea]]

 
* [[Renal]]: increased plasma [[creatinine]]

 
* [[Hematological]]: [[anemia]]

 
* [[Electrolyte]]s: [[hypokalemia]]

 
* [[Liver]]: increased [[liver enzyme]]s (asymptomatic)

 
* [[Hypersensitivity]]: rash, facial edema, [[pruritus]]

 
* Other: [[tachycardia]]

 


 
Additionally, infrequent cases of symptomatic liver damage, peripheral edema and swelling, and [[hypercalcemia]] have been seen. One case of [[anaphylaxis]] (severe allergic reaction) has also been noted.
