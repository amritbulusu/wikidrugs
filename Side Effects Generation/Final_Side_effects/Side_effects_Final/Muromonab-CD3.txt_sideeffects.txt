Especially during the first infusion, the binding of muromonab-CD3 to CD3 can activate T cells to release [[cytokines]] like [[tumor necrosis factor]] and [[interferon gamma]]. This [[cytokine release syndrome]], or CRS, includes side effects like skin reactions, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[fever]], [[chills]], [[myalgia]], [[headaches]], [[nausea]] and [[diarrhea]],<ref>{{Cite journal

Other adverse effects include [[leucopenia]], as well as an increased risk for severe infections and [[malignancies]] typical of immunosuppressive therapies. [[Neurology|Neurological]] side effects like [[aseptic meningitis]] and [[encephalopathy]] have been observed. Possibly, they are also caused by the T cell activation.<ref name="DrugsCom" />

 


 
Repeated application can result in [[tachyphylaxis]] (reduced effectiveness) due to the formation of anti-mouse antibodies in the patient, which accelerates elimination of the drug. It can also lead to an [[anaphylactic reaction]] against the mouse protein,<ref name="Mutschler" /> which may be difficult to distinguish from a CRS.
