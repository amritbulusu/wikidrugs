Compared to other SSRIs, sertraline tends to be associated with a higher rate of psychiatric side effects and diarrhea.<ref name = Maudsley /><ref name = MD>{{cite book|title=Fluoxetine Hydrochloride|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|editor=Brayfield, A|place=London, UK|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=27 November 2013|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/12763-x.htm}}</ref> It tends to be more activating (that is, associated with a higher rate of anxiety, agitation, insomnia, etc.) than other SSRIs, aside from [[fluoxetine]].<ref name = UpToDate>{{cite web|title=Side effects of antidepressant medications|work=UpToDate|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health|accessdate=27 November 2013|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=PC%2F62488&source=image_view&view=print&topicKey=PSYCH/85816&source=see_link&elapsedTimeMs=2}}</ref>

 


 
Over more than six months of sertraline therapy for depression, patients showed a nonsignificant weight increase of 0.1%.<ref name="pmid11105740">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fava M, Judge R, Hoog SL, Nilsson ME, Koke SC | title = Fluoxetine versus sertraline and paroxetine in major depressive disorder: changes in weight with long-term treatment | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 61 | issue = 11 | pages = 863–7 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11105740 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v61n1109}}</ref> Similarly, a 30-month-long treatment with sertraline for OCD resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.5% (1&nbsp;kg).<ref name="pmid15491240">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maina G, Albert U, Salvi V, Bogetto F | title = Weight gain during long-term treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a prospective comparison between serotonin reuptake inhibitors | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 10 | pages = 1365–71 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15491240 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v65n1011 }}</ref> Although the difference did not reach [[statistical significance]], the weight gain was lower for [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) (1%) but higher for [[citalopram]] (Celexa), [[fluvoxamine]] (Luvox) and [[paroxetine]] (Paxil) (2.5%). Of the sertraline group, 4.5% gained a large amount of weight (defined as more than 7% gain). This result compares favorably with placebo, where, according to the literature, 3–6% of patients gained more than 7% of their initial weight. The large weight gain was observed only among female members of the sertraline group; the significance of this finding is unclear because of the small size of the group.<ref name="pmid15491240" />

 


 
Over a two-week treatment of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal [[fluency]] but did not affect word learning, [[short-term memory]], [[alertness|vigilance]], [[flicker fusion threshold|flicker fusion time]], choice [[reaction time]], [[memory span]], or [[motor coordination|psychomotor coordination]].<ref name="pmid11565624">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmitt JA, Kruizinga MJ, Riedel WJ | title = Non-serotonergic pharmacological profiles and associated cognitive effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors | journal = J.
