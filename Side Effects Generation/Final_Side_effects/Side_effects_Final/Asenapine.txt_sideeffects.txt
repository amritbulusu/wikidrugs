Asenapine seems to have a relatively low weight gain liability for an atypical antipsychotic (which are notorious for their metabolic side effects) and according to a recent meta-analysis it produces ''[[statistical significance|significantly]]'' less weight gain (SMD [standard mean difference in weight gained in those on placebo vs. active drug]: 0.23; [[Confidence interval|95% CI]]: 0.07-0.39) than, [[paliperidone]] (SMD: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.27-0.48), [[risperidone]] (SMD: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.33-0.50), [[quetiapine]] (SMD: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.34-0.53), [[sertindole]] (SMD: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.38-0.68), [[chlorpromazine]] (SMD: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34-0.76), [[iloperidone]] (SMD: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49-0.74), [[clozapine]] (SMD: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.31-0.99), [[zotepine]] (SMD: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.47-0.96) and [[olanzapine]] (SMD: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.67-0.81) and ''approximately'' (that is, no statistically significant difference at the [[Hypothesis testing|p=0.05]] level) as much as weight gain as [[aripiprazole]] (SMD: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.05-0.28), [[lurasidone]] (SMD: 0.10; 95% CI: –0.02-0.21), [[amisulpride]] (SMD: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.05-0.35), [[haloperidol]] (SMD: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.00-0.17) and [[ziprasidone]] (SMD: 0.10; 95% CI: –0.02-0.22).<ref name=Lancet/> Its potential for elevating plasma prolactin levels seems relatively limited too according to this meta-analysis.<ref name=Lancet/> This meta-analysis also found that asenapine has approximately the same odds ratio (3.28; 95% CI: 1.37-6.69) for causing sedation [compared to placebo-treated patients] as [[olanzapine]] (3.34; 95% CI: 2.46-4.50]) and [[haloperidol]] (2.76; 95% CI: 2.04-3.66) and a higher odds ratio (although not ''significantly'') for sedation than [[aripiprazole]] (1.84; 95% CI: 1.05-3.05), [[paliperidone]] (1.40; 95% CI: 0.85-2.19) and [[amisulpride]] (1.42; 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.51) to name a few and is hence a mild-moderately sedating antipsychotic.<ref name=Lancet>{{cite journal |author1=Leucht, S |author2=Cipriani, A |author3=Spineli, L |author4=Mavridis, D |author5=Orey, D |author6=Richter, F |author7=Samara, M |author8=Barbui, C |author9=Engel, RR |author10=Geddes, JR |author11=Kissling, W |author12=Stapf, MP |author13=Lässig, B |author14=Salanti, G |author15=Davis, JM | date=September 2013 | title = Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis. | journal = Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9896 | pages = 951–962 | pmid = 23810019 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60733-3 }}</ref> Being a second-generation (''atypical'') antipsychotic its liability for causing extrapyramidal side effect is comparatively low compared to first-generation antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]] as is supported by the aforementioned meta-analysis (although this meta-analysis did reveal it had a relatively high EPS liability for an atypical antipsychotic drug).<ref name=Lancet/>
