[[Adverse effect]]s of androstanolone are similar to those of other AAS and include [[androgen]]ic side effects like [[oily skin]], [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], increased [[facial hair|facial]]/[[body hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], [[pattern hair loss|scalp hair loss]], and increased [[aggressiveness]] and [[sex drive]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In women, androstanolone can cause partially irreversible [[virilization]], for instance [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[clitoromegaly]], [[breast atrophy]], and [[muscle hypertrophy]], as well as [[menstrual irregularity|menstrual disturbance]]s and reversible [[infertility]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In men, the drug may also cause [[hypogonadism]], [[testicular atrophy]], and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" />

 


 
Androstanolone can have adverse effects on the [[cardiovascular system]], especially with long-term administration of high dosages.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> AAS like androstanolone stimulate [[erythropoiesis]] ([[red blood cell]] production) and increase [[hematocrit]] levels and at high dosages can cause [[polycythemia]] (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly increase the risk of [[thrombosis|thrombic]] events such as [[embolism]] and [[stroke]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> Unlike many other AAS, androstanolone is not [[aromatase|aromatized]] and has no risk of [[estrogen]]ic side effects like [[gynecomastia]], [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]], or [[edema]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In addition, as it is not a [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]] AAS and is administered parenterally, androstanolone has no risk of [[hepatotoxicity]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" />
