The main [[Adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s of exenatide use are gastrointestinal in nature, including acid or sour stomach, belching, diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and vomiting; exenatide is therefore not meant for people with severe gastrointestinal disease. Other side effects include dizziness, headache, and feeling jittery.<ref name="drugs.com">[http://www.drugs.com/cons/byetta.html Drugs.com Accessed September 6, 2008].</ref> Drug interactions listed on the package insert include delayed or reduced concentrations of [[lovastatin]], [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), and [[digoxin]], although this has not been proven to alter the effectiveness of these other medications.   

 
 

 
In response to [[post-marketing surveillance|postmarketing reports]] of [[acute pancreatitis]] in patients using exenatide, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] added a warning to the labeling of Byetta in 2007.<ref name="fda-1">[http://www.fda.gov/Medwatch/SAFETY/2007/safety07.htm#Byetta 2007 Safety Alerts for Drugs, Biologics, Medical Devices, and Dietary Supplements], from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].

However, diabetics do have a greater incidence of pancreatitis than do non-diabetics.

 


 
It also may increase risk of sulfonylurea-induced [[hypoglycemia]].

 


 
Additionally, the FDA has raised concerns over the lack of data to determine if the long-acting once-weekly version of exenatide (but not the twice-daily form of exenatide) may increase  [[thyroid cancer]] risk.  This concern comes out of observing a very small but nevertheless increased risk of thyroid cancer in rodents that was observed for another drug ([[liraglutide]]) that is in the same class as exenatide.  The data available for exenatide showed less of a risk towards thyroid cancer than liraglutide, but to better quantify the risk the FDA has required Amylin to conduct additional [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]] to better identify the thyroid issue.   The approved form of the once weekly exenatide [Bydureon] has a black box warning discussing the thyroid issue.    Eli Lilly has reported they have not seen a link in humans, but that it cannot be ruled out. Eli Lilly has stated the drug causes an increase in thyroid problems in rats given high doses.<ref>[http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/04/lillys-once-weekly-byetta-may-have-cancer-risk Lillyâ€™s Once-Weekly Byetta May Have Cancer Risk // Pharmalot].
