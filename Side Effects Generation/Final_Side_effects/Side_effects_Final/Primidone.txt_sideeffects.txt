[[Dupuytren's contracture]], a disease of the [[fascia]]e in the palm and fingers that permanently bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that the severity of the epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men.<ref name="Hart_and_Hooper2005">{{cite journal | last = Hart | first = M. G. |author2=G.

Primidone has other cardiovascular effects in beyond shortening the QT interval. Both it and phenobarbital are associated with elevated serum levels (both fasting and six hours after [[methionine]] loading) of [[homocysteine]], an [[amino acid]] derived from methionine. This is almost certainly related to the low folate levels reported in primidone users. Elevated levels of homocysteine have been linked to [[coronary heart disease]]. In 1985, both drugs were also reported to increase serum levels of [[high density lipoprotein]] (HDL) [[cholesterol]], total cholesterol, and [[apolipoprotein]]s A and B.<ref name="Schwaninger_et_al_1999">{{cite journal | last = Schwaninger | first = Markus |date=March 1999 | title = Elevated plasma concentrations of homocysteine in antiepileptic drug treatment |journal = [[Epilepsia (journal)|Epilepsia]] | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 345–350 | pmid = 10080517 | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb00716.x | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-03-16 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb00716.x | last2 = Ringleb | first2 = P | last3 = Winter | first3 = R | last4 = Kohl | first4 = B | last5 = Fiehn | first5 = W | last6 = Rieser | first6 = PA | last7 = Walter-Sack | first7 = I}}</ref>

 


 
It was first reported to exacerbate hepatic [[porphyria]] in 1975.

Less than 1% of primidone users will experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin, this is very low.

Anticonvulsants affect the bones in many ways. They cause [[hypophosphatemia]], [[hypocalcemia]], low Vitamin D levels, and increased [[parathyroid hormone]]. Anticonvulsants also contribute to the increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants.<ref name=Arora_et_al_2006/> In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause [[arthralgia]].<ref name=AcorusPI/>

This antagonistic effect is not due to the inhibition of [[dihydrofolate reductase]], the [[enzyme]] responsible for the [[redox|reduction]] of [[folic acid|dihydrofolic acid]] to [[folic acid|tetrahydrofolic acid]], but rather to defective folate metabolism.<ref name="meg-1976"/>
