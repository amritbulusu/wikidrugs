Comparatively common side effects in clinical studies included abnormal sensations in eye (0.5% of people treated with bromfenac), mild to moderate erosion of the [[cornea]] (0.4%), eye [[pruritus]] (0.4%), eye pain (0.3%) and redness (0.3%). Serious side effects such as [[corneal perforation]] were not reported in studies but only during post-marketing in less than one patient in 1000.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="EPAR" />
