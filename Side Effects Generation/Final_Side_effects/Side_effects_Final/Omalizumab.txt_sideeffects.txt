The main adverse effect is [[anaphylaxis]] (a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction), with a rate of occurrence of 1 to 2 patients per 1,000.<ref name=AFP05/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fanta CH |title=Asthma |journal=N.

The allergic reaction is probably not due to the binding characteristics of the antibody drug, but to the protein nature of the antibody{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. The patients who use omalizumab are generally highly allergic. Thus, even though the drug is administered with the purpose to suppress allergy (including anaphylactic reactions), it does not work immediately after injection.

IgE may play an important role in the immune system's recognition of cancer cells.<ref name="pmid12672069">{{cite journal |vauthors=Karagiannis SN, Wang Q, East N, Burke F, Riffard S, Bracher MG, Thompson RG, Durham SR, Schwartz LB, Balkwill FR, Gould HJ | title = Activity of human monocytes in IgE antibody-dependent surveillance and killing of ovarian tumor cells | journal = Eur.

The data pooled in 2003 from the earlier phase I to phase III clinical trials showed a numeric imbalance in malignancies arising in omalizumab recipients (0.5%) compared with control subjects (0.2%).<ref name=AFP05/> To clarify this imbalance, a more recent study was performed based on pooled analysis using much more comprehensive data from 67 phase I to IV clinical trials. The prespecified primary analysis assessed the incidence of primary malignancy in 32 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (RDBPC) trials. In this analysis, there were 11,459 unique patients in all clinical trials (7,789 received omalizumab). The primary analysis identified malignancies in 25 patients (RDBPC trials): 14 in 4,254 omalizumab-treated patients and 11 in 3,178 placebo-treated patients. Incidence rates per 1,000 patient-years of observation time for omalizumab- and placebo-treated patients were 4.14 (95% CI, 2.26-6.94) and 4.45 (95% CI, 2.22-7.94), respectively; the corresponding rate ratio was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.39-2.27). Primary malignancies were of varying [[histologic]] type and occurred in a number of different organ systems; no cluster of histologies was identified. The study thus concluded that in this pooled analysis no association was observed between omalizumab treatment and risk of malignancy in RDBPC trials; the rate ratio was below unity. The data suggest that a causal relationship between omalizumab therapy and malignancy is unlikely.<ref name="pmid22365654">{{cite journal |vauthors=Busse W, Buhl R, Fernandez Vidaurre C, Blogg M, Zhu J, Eisner MD, Canvin J | title = Omalizumab and the risk of malignancy: results from a pooled analysis | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 129 | issue = 4 | pages = 983–9.e6 |date=April 2012 | pmid = 22365654 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2012.01.033 }}</ref>
