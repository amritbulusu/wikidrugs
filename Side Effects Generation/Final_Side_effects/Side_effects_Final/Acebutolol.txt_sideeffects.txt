The development of [[anti-nuclear antibodies]] (ANA) has been found in 10 to 30% of patients under treatment with acebutolol. A systemic disease with arthralgic pain and myalgias has been observed in 1%. A [[lupus erythematosus]]-like syndrome with skin rash and multiforme organ involvement is even less frequent. The incidence of both ANA and symptomatic disease under acebutolol is higher than under [[Propranolol]]. Female patients are more likely to develop these symptoms than male patients. Some few cases of hepatotoxicity with increased [[liver enzymes]] ([[Alanine transaminase|ALT]], [[Alanine transaminase|AST]]) have been seen. Altogether, 5 to 6% of all patients treated have to discontinue acebutolol due to intolerable side effects. When possible, the treatment should be discontinued gradually in order to avoid a withdrawal syndrome with increased frequency of angina and even precipitation of [[myocardial infarction]].
