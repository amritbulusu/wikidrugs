Galantamine's [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] profile was very similar to that of other cholinesterase inhibitors, with [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] symptoms being the most notable and most commonly observed. One study reports higher proportions of patients treated with galantamine experiencing nausea and vomiting as opposed to the placebo group.<ref name="direct" /> Another study using a dose-escalation treatment has found that incidences of nausea would decrease to baseline levels soon after each increase in administered dosage.<ref name="springer" /> In practice, some other cholinesterase inhibitors might be better tolerated; however, a careful and gradual titration over more than three months may lead to equivalent long-term tolerability.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Birks | first1 = J | last2 = Birks | first2 = Jacqueline | title = Cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease | journal = Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) | issue = 1 | pages = CD005593 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16437532 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005593 | editor1-last = Birks | editor1-first = Jacqueline }}</ref>

 


 
The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and international health authorities have published an alert of galantamine based on data from two studies during the treatment for [[Mild cognitive impairment| mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]]; higher mortality rates were seen in drug-treated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm126138.pdf|title=FDA ALERT: Galantamine hydrobromide (marketed as Razadyne, formerly Reminyl) - Healthcare Professional Sheet|date=May 2005|work=Postmarket Drug Safety Information for Patients and Providers|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm152595.htm|title=Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products > Reminyl (galantamine hydrobromide)|date=March 2005|work=# MedWatch The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> On April 27, 2006, FDA approved labeling changes concerning all form of galantamine preparations (liquid, regular tablets, and extended release tablets) warning of the risk of [[bradycardia]] (slow resting heart rate), and sometimes atrioventricular block, especially in predisposed persons. At the same time, the risk of [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting) seems to be increased relative to placebo. "In randomized controlled trials, bradycardia was reported more frequently in galantamine-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients, but was rarely severe and rarely led to treatment discontinuation"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/apr06.htm |title=Safety Labeling Changes Approved By FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) |accessdate=2009-07-30 |date=April 2006 |work=MedWatch, The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009145003/http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/apr06.htm |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}</ref> These side effects have not been reported in Alzheimer's Disease related studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/advisories-avis/prof/_2005/reminyl_hpc-eng.php |title=Safety information from Investigational Studies with REMINYL (galantamine hydrobromide) in Mild Cognitive Impairment |publisher=Janssen-Ortho Inc. |date=2005-04-22 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>
