In studies comparing chemotherapy plus rolapitant, dexamethasone and a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist to chemotherapy plus [[placebo]], dexamethasone and a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist, most side effects had comparable frequencies in both groups, and differed more between chemotherapy regimens than between rolapitant and placebo groups. Common side effects included decreased appetite (9% under rolapitant vs. 7% under placebo), [[neutropenia]] (9% vs. 8% or 7% vs. 6%, depending on the kind of chemotherapy), dizziness (6% vs. 4%), indigestion and [[stomatitis]] (both 4% vs. 2%).<ref name="Drugs.com" />
