Mechlorethamine is a highly toxic medication, especially for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing age.<ref>Recordati Rare Diseases Inc. (2013). Mustargen Package Insert.

The adverse effects of mechlorethamine depend on the formulation.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pro/mustargen.html Mustargen] and [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/202317lbl.pdf Valchlor]</ref> When used in chemical warfare, it can cause immunosuppression and damage to mucous membranes of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Mucous membranes and damp or damaged skin are more affected by exposure to HN-2. Though symptoms of exposure are generally delayed, the DNA damage it causes occurs very quickly. More serious exposures cause symptoms to develop sooner. Eye symptoms develop first, in the first 1–2 hours (severe exposure) or 3–12 hours (mild to moderate exposure) followed by airway (2-6/12–24 hours) and skin symptoms (6–48 hours). Hot, humid weather shortens the latent (symptom-free) period.<ref name=":0" />

 


 
Symptoms of toxic exposure to HN-2 vary based on the route of exposure. Eye exposure causes [[Tears|lacrimation]] (tear production), burning, irritation, itching, a feeling of grittiness or dryness, [[blepharospasm]] (spasms of the eyelid), and [[miosis]] (pinpoint pupils). More severe cases cause [[edema]] (swelling from fluid accumulation) in the eyelids, [[photophobia]] (extreme sensitivity to light), severe pain, [[corneal ulcer]]ation, and blindness.<ref name=":0" />

 


 
Inhalation of chlormethine damages the upper and lower airways sequentially, with more severe exposures causing faster damage that afflicts lower parts of the respiratory tract. Early symptoms include [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose), [[Nosebleed|epistaxis]] (nosebleed), toneless voice, sneezing, barking cough, and [[dyspnea]] (in smokers and asthmatics). Later symptoms include pain in the nose/sinuses and inflammation of the airway. In severe cases, there may be epithelial necrosis throughout the respiratory tract, causing pseudomembrane formation, which can obstruct the airway. [[Pneumonia]] may develop and prove fatal.<ref name=":0" />

 


 
Skin exposure mainly causes [[erythema]] (redness) and [[Blister|vesication]] (blistering) at first, but absorption through the skin causes systemic toxicity. In cases where more than 25% of the skin is affected, fatal exposure is likely to have occurred.<ref name=":0" />

 


 
Though ingestion is uncommon, if mechlorethamine is swallowed it causes severe chemical burns to the gastrointestinal tract and concomitant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hemorrhage.<ref name=":0" />

 


 
Long-term effects of acute or chronic chlormethine exposure are caused by damage to the [[immune system]]. [[White blood cell]] counts drop, increasing the risk of infection, and [[red blood cell]] and [[platelet]] counts may also drop due to [[bone marrow]] damage. Chronic eye infections may result from exposure, but blindness is temporary. Long-term effects on the respiratory system include [[anosmia]] (inability to smell), [[ageusia]] (inability to taste), inflammation, chronic infections, fibrosis, and cancer. Skin that has been damaged by HN2 can change pigmentation or become scarred, and may eventually develop cancer.<ref name=":0" />
