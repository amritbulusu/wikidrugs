Side effects associated with domperidone include [[dry mouth]], [[abdominal cramp]]s, [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[rash]], [[pruritus|itching]], [[urticaria|hives]], and [[hyperprolactinemia]] (the symptoms of which may include [[mammoplasia|breast enlargement]], [[galactorrhea]], [[mastodynia|breast pain/tenderness]], [[gynecomastia]], [[hypogonadism]], and [[irregular menstruation|menstrual irregularities]]).<ref name="Henderson2003">{{cite journal|last1=Henderson|first1=Amanda|title=Domperidone: Discovering New Choices for Lactating Mothers|journal=AWHONN Lifelines|volume=7|issue=1|year=2003|pages=54â€“60|issn=1091-5923|doi=10.1177/1091592303251726|pmid=12674062}}</ref> Due to blockade of D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the [[central nervous system]], D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists like [[metoclopramide]] can also produce a variety of additional side effects including [[drowsiness]], [[akathisia]], [[psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], [[insomnia]], [[lassitude]], [[fatigue (medicine)|fatigue]], [[extrapyramidal symptom]]s, [[dystonia]], [[parkinsonism|Parkinsonian symptom]]s, [[tardive dyskinesia]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="ReddymasuSoykan2007" /><ref name="pmid10332535" /> However, this is not the case with domperidone, because, unlike other D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, it minimally crosses the [[blood-brain-barrier]], and for this reason, is rarely associated with such side effects.<ref name="ReddymasuSoykan2007" /><ref name="pmid10332535" />
