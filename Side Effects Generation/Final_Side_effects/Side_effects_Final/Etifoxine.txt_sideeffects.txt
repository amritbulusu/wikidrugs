Contrary to comments in non-refereed on line journals, the committee found (for a ten-year pharmacovigilance period) that safety concerns were rare or very rare and that the incidence of idiosyncratic hepatic problems were very rare (less than drugs like Lipitor).http://ansm.sante.fr/var/ansm_site/storage/original/application/56a2e1cb1dbc986720da09842df11c22.pdf
