The most common adverse effect is rash. Grade 3 adverse events (mainly [[anemia]] and [[leukopenia]]/[[neutropenia]]) were more frequent in the telaprevir groups than in the control group (37% vs. 22%).

 
After receiving reports of serious skin reactions, some fatal, in patients taking the hepatitis C drug Incivek (telaprevir) in combination with drugs peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (Incivek combination treatment), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added a black box warning to the label of this Vertex Pharmaceutical Inc. product. 1 

 
On December 19, 2012, Vertex announced it would add a [[boxed warning]] of possible side effects on the US labels of telaprevir, following "reports of a small number of fatal skin reactions in patients who continued to receive Incivek combination therapy after a serious skin reaction was identified.”  The FDA reported two people had died from serious skin reactions caused by the Incivek combination treatment and a total of 112 patients had developed serious skin reactions of two different types.<ref>Staff, Boston.com.
