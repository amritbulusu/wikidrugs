 
Very little is known about the [[psychopharmacological]] properties of EiPT, but reports suggest it produces psychedelic effects that can last 4-6 hours.  According to Shulgin, this compound tends to produce [[nausea]], [[dysphoria]], and other unpleasant side-effects.  It also lacks the hallucinatory and visual properties usually associated with psychedelic drugs.
