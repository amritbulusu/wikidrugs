Cefuroxime is generally well-tolerated and its side effects are usually transient. If ingested after food, this antibiotic is both better absorbed and less likely to cause its most common side effects of [[diarrhea]], nausea, vomiting, headaches/[[migraine]]s, dizziness, and abdominal pain compared to most antibiotics in its class.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

 


 
Although a widely stated cross-allergic risk of about 10% exists between cephalosporins and [[penicillin]], recent assessments have shown no increased risk for a cross-allergic reaction for cefuroxime and several other second-generation or later cephalosporins.<ref name="pmid16451776">{{cite journal |author=Pichichero ME |title=Cephalosporins can be prescribed safely for penicillin-allergic patients |journal=The Journal of family practice |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=106â€“12 |year=2006 |pmid=16451776 |url=http://www.jfponline.com/pdf%2F5502%2F5502JFP_AppliedEvidence1.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>
