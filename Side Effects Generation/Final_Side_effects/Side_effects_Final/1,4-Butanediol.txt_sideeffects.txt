1,4-Butanediol is also used as a [[recreational drug]] known by some users as "One Comma Four", "Liquid Fantasy", "One Four Bee" or "One Four B-D-O". It exerts effects similar to [[gamma-hydroxybutyrate|γ-hydroxybutyrate]] (GHB), which is a metabolic product of 1,4-butanediol.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Satta | first1 = Rosalba | last2 = Dimitrijevic | first2 = Nikola | last3 = Manev | first3 = Hari | year = 2003 | title = ''Drosophila'' metabolize 1,4-butanediol into γ-hydroxybutyric acid in vivo | journal = Eur.
