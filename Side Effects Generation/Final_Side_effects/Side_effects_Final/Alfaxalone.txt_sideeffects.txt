Alfaxalone has relatively few side effects compared to other anesthetics; most notable is its lack of [[cardiovascular]] depression at clinical doses, which makes it unique among anesthetics.<ref name=ferre /><ref name=nieu /> The most common side effect is respiratory depression: in addition to [[apnea]], the most prevalent, alfaxalone can also decrease the [[respiratory rate]], [[minute volume]], and [[oxygen saturation]] in the blood in cats and dogs.<ref name=grimm /> Alfaxalone should be administered slowly over a period of at least 60 seconds or until anesthesia is induced; as quick administration increases the risk of apnea.<ref name="dailymed" /><ref name=nieu /> Alfaxalone has some depressive effects on the [[central nervous system]], including a reduction in [[Cerebral circulation|cerebral flood flow]] and [[intracranial pressure]], as well as in [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]].<ref name=grimm />

 


 
[[Greyhound]]s, who are particularly susceptible to anesthetic side effects, can have decreased blood flow and oxygen supply to the [[liver]].<ref name=grimm /> 

 


 
When no premedications are used, alfaxalone causes animals (especially cats) to be agitated when recovering.<ref name="rezende" /><ref name=nieu /> Dogs and cats will paddle in the air, vocalize excessively, may remain rigid or twitch, and have exaggerated reactions to external stimuli such as light and noise. For this reason, it is recommended that animals recovering from anesthesia by alfaxalone stay in a quiet, dark area.<ref name=grimm />
