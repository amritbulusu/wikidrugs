In Entry 26 of his compendium ''[[TiHKAL]]'', which discussed LSD, [[Alexander Shulgin|Shulgin]] touched briefly on the subject of ALD-52. His writings are vague, second hand accounts, saying doses in the 50–175&nbsp;µg range have resulted in various conclusions. One account found that there was less visual distortion than with LSD and it seemed to produce less anxiety and tenseness and that it was somewhat less potent. Another informant claimed it was more effective in increasing [[blood pressure]]. Yet another informant could not tell them apart.<ref>{{CiteTiHKAL}}</ref>
