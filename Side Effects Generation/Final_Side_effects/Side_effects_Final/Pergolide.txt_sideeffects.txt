The drug is in decreasing use, as it was reported in 2003 to be associated with a form of heart disease called [[cardiac fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb/aadr0408.htm |date=August 2004 | title = Cardiac valvulopathy with pergolide | author = ADRAC | journal = Aust Adv Drug React Bull | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | authorlink = Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee}} [http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb/aadr0408.htm Free full text] from the [[Australia]]n [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]</ref> In 2007, The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] announced a voluntary withdrawal of the drug by manufacturers due to the possibility of heart valve damage.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm051285.html Public Health Advisory - Pergolide (marketed as Permax)]</ref> Pergolide is not currently available in the United States for human use. This problem is thought to be due to pergolide's action at the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> serotonin receptors of cardiac myocytes, causing proliferative valve disease by the same mechanism as [[ergotamine]], [[methysergide]], [[fenfluramine]], and other serotonin 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> agonists, including serotonin itself when elevated in the blood in [[carcinoid syndrome]]. Pergolide can rarely cause [[Raynaud's phenomenon]].
