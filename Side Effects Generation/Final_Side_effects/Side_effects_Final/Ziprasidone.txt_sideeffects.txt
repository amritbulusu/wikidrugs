Recently, the FDA required the manufacturers of some atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of [[hyperglycemia]] and [[Type II diabetes]] with atypical antipsychotics. Some evidence suggests that ziprasidone does not cause [[insulin resistance]] to the degree of other atypical antipsychotics, such as [[Zyprexa]].
