A higher number of [[cardiovascular events]] has been observed in people taking sibutramine versus control (11.4% vs. 10.0%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm191650.htm |title=Early Communication about an Ongoing Safety Review ofÂ Meridia (sibutramine hydrochloride) |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  In 2010 the FDA noted the concerns that sibutramine increases the risk of [[heart attacks]] and [[strokes]] in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm198221.htm |title=Meridia (sibutramine hydrochloride): Follow-Up to an Early Communication about an Ongoing Safety Review |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

 


 
Frequently encountered [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s are: dry mouth, paradoxically increased appetite, [[nausea]], [[dysgeusia|strange taste in the mouth]], upset stomach, constipation, trouble sleeping, dizziness, drowsiness, menstrual cramps/pain, headache, flushing, or joint/muscle pain.

 


 
Sibutramine can substantially increase [[blood pressure]] and heart rate in some patients.<ref>Siebenhofer A, Jeitler K, Horvath K, Berghold A, Siering U, Semlitsch T. Long-term effects of weight-reducing drugs in hypertensive patients. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD007654. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007654.pub3.</ref> Therefore, regular monitoring needs to be performed.

 


 
The following side effects are infrequent but serious and require immediate medical attention: [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, [[paresthesia]], mental/mood changes (e.g., excitement, restlessness, confusion, depression, rare thoughts of [[suicide]]).

 


 
Symptoms that require urgent medical attention are [[seizure]]s, problems urinating, abnormal bruising or bleeding, [[melena]], [[hematemesis]], [[jaundice]], [[fever]] and [[rigor (medicine)|rigor]]s, [[chest pain]], [[hemiplegia]], abnormal vision, [[dyspnea]] and [[edema]].

 


 
Currently, no case of [[pulmonary hypertension]] has been noted.  (Fenfluramine, of the 1990s "Fen-Phen" combo, forced excess release of neurotransmitters—a different action. Phentermine was uninvolved in the rare—but clinically significant—heart issues of fenfluramine.)
