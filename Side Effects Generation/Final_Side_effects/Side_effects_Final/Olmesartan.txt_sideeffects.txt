The incidence of adverse effects with Benicar (the US trade name for olmesartan medoxomil) is reported as similar to placebo; the only adverse effect that occurred in >1% of patients treated with it and more frequently than placebo was dizziness (3% vs 1%).  The full prescribing information for Benicar notes as with all drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system, olmesartan is contraindicated in pregnancy and can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. In studies of angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as olmesartan, patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.benicar.com/pdf/prescribing_information.pdf|title=BENICAR Prescribing Information|accessdate=2011-01-20}}</ref>

 
Rarely, olmesartan can cause severe [[gastrointestinal issues]]. The symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and electrolyte abnormalities, are common among those who have [[celiac disease]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=De Petris G, Caldero SG, Chen L, etal |title=Histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract due to medications: an update for the surgical pathologist (part II of II) |journal=Int.

However, it is still unclear why this action was never observed with other ARBs.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Severe Spruelike Enteropathy Associated With Olmesartan|journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date = 2012-08-01|issn = 0025-6196|pmc = 3538487|pmid = 22728033|pages = 732–738|volume = 87|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.06.003|first = Alberto|last = Rubio-Tapia|first2 = Margot L.|last2 = Herman|first3 = Jonas F.|last3 = Ludvigsson|first4 = Darlene G.|last4 = Kelly|first5 = Thomas F.|last5 = Mangan|first6 = Tsung-Teh|last6 = Wu|first7 = Joseph A.|last7 = Murray}}</ref>
