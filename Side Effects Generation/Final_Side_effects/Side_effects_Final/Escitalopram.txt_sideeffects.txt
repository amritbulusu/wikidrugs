Escitalopram, like other [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]], has been shown to affect sexual functions causing side effects such as decreased [[libido]], [[delayed ejaculation]], genital anesthesia,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bolton JM, Sareen J, Reiss JP | title = Genital anesthesia persisting six years after sertraline discontinuation | journal = J Sex Marital Ther | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–30 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16709553 | doi = 10.1080/00926230600666410 }}</ref> and [[anorgasmia]].<ref name="pmid16430968">{{cite journal |vauthors=Clayton A, Keller A, McGarvey EL | title = Burden of phase-specific sexual dysfunction with SSRIs | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16430968 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allergan.com/Assets/PDF/Lexapro_pi.pdf|title=Lexapro prescribing information|publisher=}}</ref>

 


 
An analysis conducted by the FDA found a statistically insignificant 1.5 to 2.4-fold (depending on the statistical technique used) increase of [[suicidality]] among the adults treated with escitalopram for psychiatric indications.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web |vauthors=Levenson M, Holland C | title =Antidepressants and Suicidality in Adults: Statistical Evaluation.
