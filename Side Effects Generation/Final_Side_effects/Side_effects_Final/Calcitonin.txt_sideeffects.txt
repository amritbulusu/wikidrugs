More specifically, calcitonin lowers blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in two ways:

:* Minor effect: Inhibits [[nephron|renal tubular cell]] reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate, allowing them to be excreted in the [[urine]]<ref name="Harrison Chapter">{{cite book |url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=331&sectionid=40727159 |last1=Potts |first1=John |last2=Jüppner |first2=Harald |name-list-format=vanc |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |chapter=Chapter 353.

High concentrations of calcitonin may be able to increase urinary excretion of  calcium and phosphate, via actions on the [[kidney]] tubules.<ref name="pmid9058369">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carney SL | title = Calcitonin and human renal calcium and electrolyte transport | journal = Mineral and Electrolyte Metabolism | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9058369 }}</ref> However, this is a minor effect with no physiological significance in humans. It is also a short-lived effect because the kidneys become resistant to calcitonin, as demonstrated by the kidney's unaffected excretion of calcium in patients with thyroid tumors that secrete excessive calcitonin.<ref name="Goodman_2009">{{cite book | title = Basic Medical Endocrinology | edition = Fourth  | last = Goodman | first = H.

In its skeleton-preserving actions, calcitonin protects against calcium loss from skeleton during periods of calcium mobilization, such as [[pregnancy]] and, especially, [[lactation]]. The protective mechanisms include the direct inhibition of bone resorption and the indirect effect through the inhibition of the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. The reason provided is that prolactin induces the release of PTH related peptide which enhances bone resorption, but is still under investigation., <ref name="Horwitz MJ1, Tedesco MB, Sereika SM, Syed MA, Garcia-Ocaña A, Bisello A, Hollis BW, Rosen CJ, Wysolmerski JJ, Dann P, Gundberg C, Stewart AF">{{cite journal|title=Continuous PTH and PTHrP infusion causes suppression of bone formation and discordant effects on 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D.|journal=J Bone Miner Res.|date=2005 Oct;20|pages=1792–803|pmid=16160737}}</ref><ref name="Rachel A Davey, Andrew G Turner, Julie F McManus, WS Maria Chiu, Francisca Tjahyono, Alison J Moore, Gerald J Atkins, Paul H Anderson, Cathy Ma, Vaida Glatt, Helen E MacLean, Cristina Vincent, Mary Bouxsein, Howard A Morris, David M Findlay, Jeffrey D Zajac">{{cite journal|title=Calcitonin Receptor Plays a Physiological Role to Protect Against Hypercalcemia in Mice|journal=JBMR|date=17 March 2008|volume=23|pages=1182–1193|doi=10.1359/jbmr.080310}}</ref><ref name="Janine P.

Other effects are in preventing postprandial [[hypercalcemia]] resulting from absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Also, calcitonin inhibits food intake in rats and monkeys, and may have [[Central nervous system|CNS]] action involving the regulation of feeding and appetite.

 


 
Calcitonin lowers blood calcium and phosphorus mainly through its inhibition of osteoclasts. Osteoblasts do not have calcitonin receptors and are therefore not directly affected by calcitonin levels. However, since bone resorption and bone formation are coupled processes, eventually calcitonin's inhibition of osteoclastic activity leads to decreased osteoblastic activity (as an indirect effect).<ref name="Goodman_2009" />
