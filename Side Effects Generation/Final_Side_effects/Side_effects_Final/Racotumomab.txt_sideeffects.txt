 
Racotumomab is administered in patients who have previously received the oncospecific treatment established in the oncological therapeutic standards (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy).

 
A Racotumomab-[[alum]] solution is administered by intradermal injection every 14 days for the first 2 months (5 doses), followed by monthly booster doses.

 


 
Racotumomab is well tolerated by patients. The overall toxicity of the vaccine has been classified as grade 1 and 2, according to the NCI [[Common Toxicity Criteria]] (version 3.0). Treatment is mostly associated with mild to moderate injection-site reactions (local erithema, induration and pain), which disappear within 24–48 hours. Systemic reactions, such as flu-like symptoms and chills are less frequent, reversible, and self-limited.<ref>Vázquez, A.M, Hernández, A.M., Macías, A., et al. (2012).
