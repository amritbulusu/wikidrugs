The use of clavulanic acid with penicillins has been associated with an increased incidence of [[cholestasis|cholestatic jaundice]] and acute [[hepatitis]] during therapy or shortly after. The associated jaundice is usually self-limiting and very rarely fatal.<ref>Joint Formulary Committee. [[British National Formulary]], 47th edition.

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] (CSM) recommends that treatments such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid preparations be reserved for bacterial infections likely to be caused by amoxicillin-resistant β-lactamase-producing strains, and that treatment should not normally exceed 14 days.
