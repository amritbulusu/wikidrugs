Allergies occur in less than 1% of cases. Most adverse effects in clinical trials were mild and transient.<ref name="AustriaCodex" /><ref name="Wagstaff">{{Cite journal | last1 = Wagstaff | first1 = A.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] has listed a number of safety concerns to be evaluated on a post-marketing basis, most notably the theoretical possibilities of [[spleen]] rupture and tumor cell mobilisation. The first concern has been raised because [[splenomegaly]] was observed in animal studies, and G-CSF can cause spleen rupture in rare cases. Mobilisation of tumor cells has occurred in patients with leukaemia treated with plerixafor.<ref name="CHMP">{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/human/001030/WC500030689.pdf|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|title=CHMP Assessment Report for Mozobil}}</ref>
