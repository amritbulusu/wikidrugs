Phenothrin has been found to possess [[antiandrogen]] properties, and was responsible for a small epidemic of [[gynecomastia]] via isolated environmental exposure.<ref name="BarrosSampaio2012">{{cite journal|last1=Barros|first1=Alfredo Carlos Simões Dornellas de|last2=Sampaio|first2=Marcelo de Castro Moura|title=Gynecomastia: physiopathology, evaluation and treatment|journal=Sao Paulo Medical Journal|volume=130|issue=3|year=2012|pages=187–197|issn=1516-3180|doi=10.1590/S1516-31802012000300009|quote=Reinforcing the evidence suggesting that there is a relationship between chemicals and GM, it is worthwhile mentioning the epidemic onset observed among Haitian refugees in 1981 about four months after arrival in United States detention centers.22 After analyzing all identifiable environmental exposures, it was then found that phenothrin, a multi-insecticide contained in sprays that they had used was the causative agent.23 It is now widely known that phenothrin has antiandrogenic activity.|pmid=22790552}}</ref><ref name="Brody, MD, PhD, FACELoriaux, MD2003">{{cite journal|last1=Brody, MD, PhD, FACE|first1=Steven A.|last2=Loriaux, MD|first2=D.

The EPA has not assessed its effect on cancer in humans. However, one study performed by the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine links sumithrin with [[breast cancer]]; the link made by sumithrin's effect on increasing the expression of a gene responsible for [[mammary]] tissue proliferation.<ref name= A/>
