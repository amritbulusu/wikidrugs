Flunixin is labeled for no more than 5 days of consecutive use and prolonged use increases the risk of toxicity. In horses, this includes [[equine gastric ulcer syndrome|gastric ulcers]],<ref>Videla, R. & Andrews, F.M. (2009) New perspectives in equine gastriculcer syndrome.

Flunixin is a prohibited substance under [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] rules,<ref>{{cite web|title=FEI Prohibited Substances List|url=http://www.fei.org/fei/cleansport/ad-h/prohibited-list|accessdate=23 January 2016}}</ref> and its use is prohibited or restricted by many other equestrian organizations. At labeled dose (1.1&nbsp;mg/kg) given IV, detection time was found to be 144 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=FEI List of Detection Times|url=http://www.fei.org/system/files/FEI%20detection%20times%20lab%202015.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2016}}</ref> However, drug recycling from bedding contamination by treated horses has been shown to potentially increase the clearance time.<ref>POPOT, M.
