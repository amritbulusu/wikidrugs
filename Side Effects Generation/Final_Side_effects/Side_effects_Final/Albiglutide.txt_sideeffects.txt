Common side effects (in more than 10% of patients) in clinical trials were diarrhoea, [[nausea]], and, unsurprisingly, [[hypoglycaemia]] (low blood [[glucose]] levels) and reactions at the injection site. [[Upper respiratory tract infection]]s were also common, but only slightly more so than under [[placebo]]. Uncommon but potentially severe side effects included acute [[pancreatitis]] (in 0.3% of patients) and [[hypersensitivity]] reactions (in fewer than 0.1%).<ref name="EPAR" /><ref name="Drugs.com" />
