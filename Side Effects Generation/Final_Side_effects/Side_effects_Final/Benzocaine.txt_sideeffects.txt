Benzocaine is generally well-tolerated and non-toxic when applied topically as recommended.<ref>Lexicomp Online, Adult and Pediatric Lexi-Drugs Online, Hudson, Ohio: Lexi-Comp, Inc.; 2013; April 15, 2013.</ref>

 


 
However, there have been reports of serious, life-threatening adverse effects (e.g., seizures, coma, irregular heart beat, respiratory depression) with over-application of topical products or when applying topical products that contain high concentrations of benzocaine to the skin.<ref>Food and Drug Administration. FDA Public Health Advisory: Life-threatening side effects with use of skin products containing numbing ingredients for cosmetic procedures. 2007 Feb 6, updated 2007 Feb 9.

Overapplication of oral anesthetics such as benzocaine can increase the risk of [[pulmonary aspiration]] by relaxing the gag-reflex and allowing regurgitated stomach contents or oral secretions to enter the airway. Applying an oral anesthetic and consuming beverages before going to bed can be particularly hazardous.

 


 
The topical use of higher concentration (14-20%) benzocaine spray products applied to the mouth or mucous membranes has been found to be a cause of [[methemoglobinemia]], a disorder in which the amount of oxygen carried by the blood is greatly reduced.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7730550 |year=1995 |author1=Shua-Haim |first1=J.
