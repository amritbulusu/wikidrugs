On 26 May 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about cases of severe liver injury that have been reported rarely with the use of this medication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm213038.htm|title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: Completed safety review of Xenical/Alli (orlistat) and severe liver injury|work=fda.gov}}</ref>

 


 
An analysis of over 900 orlistat users in Ontario showed that their rate of acute kidney injury was more than triple that of non-users.<ref>http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/171/7/703</ref> The putative mechanism for this effect is postulated to be excessive oxalate absorption from the gut and its subsequent deposition in the kidney, with excessive oxalate absorption being a known consequence of fat malabsorption.

 


 
An April 2013 study published in the British Medical Journal <ref>{{cite journal |author1=Douglas, Ian J |author2=Julia Langham |author3=Krishnan Bhaskaran |author4=Ruth Brauer |author5=Liam Smeeth |title = Orlistat and the risk of acute liver injury: self controlled case series study in UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink |journal=BMJ |volume=346 |pages=f1936 | year = 2013 |doi = 10.1136/bmj.f1936 |pmid=23585064 |pmc=3624963 |url = http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f1936}}</ref> looked at 94,695 patients receiving orlistat in the UK between 1999 and 2011. This study showed no evidence of an increased risk of liver injury during treatment. They concluded:

 
:''The incidence of acute liver injury was higher in the periods both immediately before and immediately after the start of orlistat treatment. This suggests that the observed increased risks of liver injury linked to the start of treatment may reflect changes in health status associated with the decision to begin treatment rather than any causal effect of the drug.''
