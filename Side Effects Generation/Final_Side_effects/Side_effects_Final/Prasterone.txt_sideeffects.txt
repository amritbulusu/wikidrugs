Prasterone is produced naturally in the human body, but the long-term effects of its use are largely unknown.<ref name=cancer/><ref name=WebMD/> In the short term, several studies have noted few adverse effects. In a study by Chang ''et al.'', prasterone was administered at a dose of 200&nbsp;mg/day for 24 weeks with slight [[androgenic]] effects noted.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang DM, Lan JL, Lin HY, Luo SF | title = Dehydroepiandrosterone treatment of women with mild-to-moderate systemic lupus erythematosus: a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial | journal = Arthritis Rheum | year = 2002 | volume = 46 | issue = 11 | pages = 2924–27 | doi = 10.1002/art.10615 | pmid = 12428233}}</ref> Another study utilized a dose up to 400&nbsp;mg/day for 8 weeks with few adverse events reported.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rabkin JG, McElhiney MC, Rabkin R, McGrath PJ, Ferrando SJ | title = Placebo-controlled trial of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for treatment of nonmajor depression in patients with HIV/AIDS | journal = Am J Psychiatry | year = 2006 | volume = 163 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.59 | pmid = 16390890}}</ref> A longer term study followed patients dosed with 50&nbsp;mg of prasterone for 12 months with the number and severity of side effects reported to be small.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brooke AM, Kalingag LA, Miraki-Moud F, Camacho-Hübner C, Maher KT, Walker DM, Hinson JP, Monson JP | title = Dehydroepiandrosterone improves psychological well-being in male and female hypopituitary patients on maintenance growth hormone replacement | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | year = 2006 | volume = 91 | issue = 10 | pages = 3773–79 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2006-0316 | pmid = 16849414}}</ref> Another study delivered a dose of 50&nbsp;mg of prasterone for 10 months with no serious adverse events reported.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Villareal DT, Holloszy JO | title = DHEA enhances effects of weight training on muscle mass and strength in elderly women and men | journal = Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab | year = 2006 | volume = 291 | issue = 5 | pages = E1003–08 | doi = 10.1152/ajpendo.00100.2006}}</ref>

 


 
As a hormone precursor, there have been reports of side effects possibly caused by the hormone metabolites of prasterone.<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/dosage?cid=med&drugid=3512&drugname=DHEA+Oral&monotype=default|title=DHEA Oral|last=Medscape|year=2010|work=Drug Reference|publisher=WebMD LLC.|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-dhea.html#Safety|title=DHEA|last=Medline Plus|work=Drugs and Supplements Information|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref>

 


 
It is not known whether prasterone is safe for long-term use. Some researchers believe prasterone supplements might actually raise the risk of [[breast cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]],<ref name=WebMD/> and [[stroke]]. Prasterone may stimulate tumor growth in types of cancer that are sensitive to hormones, such as some types of breast, uterine, and prostate cancer.<ref name=WebMD/> Prasterone may increase prostate swelling in men with [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland.<ref name=cancer/>

 


 
Prasterone is a [[steroid hormone]]. High doses may cause aggressiveness, irritability, trouble sleeping, and the growth of body or facial hair on women.<ref name=cancer/> It also may stop menstruation and lower the levels of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] ("good" cholesterol), which could raise the risk of heart disease.<ref name=cancer/> Other reported side effects include acne, heart rhythm problems, liver problems, hair loss (from the scalp), and oily skin. It may also alter the body's regulation of blood sugar.<ref name=cancer/>

 


 
Prasterone may promote [[tamoxifen]] resistance.<ref name=cancer/> Patients on hormone replacement therapy may have more estrogen-related side effects when taking prasterone. This supplement may also interfere with other medicines, and potential interactions between it and drugs and herbs are possible.<ref name=cancer>{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |work=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editor=Ades TB |pages=729–33 |title=DHEA}}</ref>

 


 
Prasterone is possibly unsafe for individuals experiencing pregnancy, breastfeeding, hormone sensitive conditions, liver problems, diabetes, depression or mood disorders, [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] (PCOS), or cholesterol problems.<ref>{{cite web|title=DHEA: Side effects and safety|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-331-DHEA.aspx?activeIngredientId=331&activeIngredientName=DHEA|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>
