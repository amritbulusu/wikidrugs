Use of NSAIDs increases risk of having a range of [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] (GI) problems.<ref name="RostomDube2002">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rostom A, Dube C, Wells G, Tugwell P, Welch V, Jolicoeur E, McGowan J |title=Prevention of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcers |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002296 |year=2002 |pmid=12519573 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002296 }}</ref> NSAIDs are commonly used for pain management after surgery, however there is evidence of increased risk of kidney problems.<ref name="LeeCooper2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee A, Cooper MG, Craig JC, Knight JF, Keneally JP |title=Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on postoperative renal function in adults with normal renal function |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD002765 |year=2007 |pmid=17443518 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002765.pub3 }}</ref> Their use following gastrointestinal surgery remains controversial, given mixed evidence of increased risk of leakage from any bowel [[anastomosis]] created. <ref name="STARSurg2017">{{cite journal |author=StarSurg Collaborative |title=Safety of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs in Major Gastrointestinal Surgery: A Prospective, Multicenter Cohort Study |journal=World Journal of Surgery |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=47-55 |year=2017 |pmid=27766396 |doi=10.1007/s00268-016-3727-3}}</ref><ref name="STARSurg2014">{{cite journal |author=StarSurg Collaborative |title=Impact of postoperative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on adverse events after gastrointestinal surgery. |journal=BJS |volume=101 |issue=11 |pages=1413-23|year=2014 |pmid=25091299 |doi=10.1002/bjs.9614}}</ref><ref name="Bhangu2014">{{cite journal |vauthors= Bhangu A, Singh P, Fitzgerald JE, Slesser A, Tekkis P |title=Postoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of anastomotic leak: meta-analysis of clinical and experimental studies |journal=World Journal of Surgery |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=2247-57 |year=2014 |pmid=24682313 |doi=10.1007/s00268-014-2531-1}}</ref>

 


 
An estimated 10â€“20% of NSAID patients experience [[dyspepsia]]. In the 1990s high doses of prescription NSAIDs were associated with serious upper gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding.<ref name="pmid11464731"/> Over the past decade, deaths associated with gastric bleeding have declined.

 


 
NSAIDs, like all drugs, may interact with other medications. For example, concurrent use of NSAIDs and [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]] may increase the risk of quinolones' adverse [[central nervous system]] effects, including seizure.<ref>

There is an argument over the benefits and risks of NSAIDs for treating chronic musculoskeletal pain.
