Ketoconazole is a [[Pregnancy category (pharmaceutical)|pregnancy category C]] drug because animal testing has shown it to cause [[Teratology|teratogenesis]] when administered in high doses. Recently, the administration of systemic ketoconazole to two pregnant women for treatment of [[Cushing's syndrome]] was reported to have no adverse effects,<ref name=pregnancy_1>{{cite journal | vauthors = Amado JA, Pesquera C, Gonzalez EM, Otero M, Freijanes J, Alvarez A | title = Successful treatment with ketoconazole of Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy | journal = Postgraduate Medical Journal | volume = 66 | issue = 773 | pages = 221–3 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2362890 | pmc = 2429473 | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.66.773.221 }}</ref><ref name=pregnancy_2>{{cite journal | vauthors = Berwaerts J, Verhelst J, Mahler C, Abs R | title = Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy treated by ketoconazole: case report and review of the literature | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–82 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10451809 | doi = 10.3109/09513599909167552 }}</ref> but this small sample precludes drawing any meaningful conclusions.

On July 2013, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a warning that taking ketoconazole orally can cause severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems.  It recommends Nizoral oral tablets should not be a first-line treatment for any fungal infection.  Nizoral should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or tolerated.<ref name="fda_warning">{{cite news | title=FDA limits usage of Nizoral (ketoconazole) oral tablets due to potentially fatal liver injury and risk of drug interactions and adrenal gland problems | newspaper=FDA Drug Safety Communication | url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm362415.htm | publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | date=July 26, 2013 | accessdate=November 23, 2013}}</ref>

 


 
The topical formulations of Nizoral have not been associated with liver damage, adrenal problems, or drug interactions. These formulations include creams, shampoos, foams, and gels applied to the skin, unlike the Nizoral tablets, which are taken by mouth.<ref name="fda_warning"/>
