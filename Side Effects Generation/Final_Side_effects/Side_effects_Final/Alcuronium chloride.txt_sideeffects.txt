 
* Cardiovascular system: histamine release and blockage of the sympathetic ganglia including adrenal medulla could cause hypotension 

 
* Respiratory: apnea due to phrenic blockage but bronchoconstriction can occur from the histamine release

 
* Central nervous system: no effect on intraoccular pressure

 
* Autonomic ganglion blockade can cause decrease in gut motility
