Canagliflozin is an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of subtype 2 sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2), which is responsible for at least 90% of [[renal glucose reabsorption]] ([[SGLT1]] being responsible for the remaining 10%). Blocking this transporter causes up to 119 grams of blood glucose per day to be eliminated through the urine.<ref name="prous.com">[http://www.prous.com/molecules/default.asp?ID=165 Prous Science: Molecule of the Month November 2007]</ref> It was developed by [[Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma]] and is marketed under license by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Janssen]], a division of [[Johnson & Johnson]].<ref name=JNJ>http://www.investor.jnj.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=710584</ref>
