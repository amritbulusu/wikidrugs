Common side effects of brotizolam are typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines and are related to [[Central nervous system|CNS depression]], and include [[somnolence]], [[ataxia]], [[headache]], [[anterograde amnesia]], [[dizziness]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], impairment of motor functions, slurred speech, [[confusion]], and [[Accident-proneness|clumsiness]].

 


 
Less common side effects include [[hypotension]], [[respiratory depression]], hallucinations, nausea and vomiting, [[palpitation]]s, and paradoxical reactions (i.e. aggression, anxiety, violent behavior, etc.).

 


 
Brotizolam can cause residual side effects the next day such as impaired cognitive and motor functions as well as drowsiness. Disruption of sleep patterns may also occur such as suppression of [[REM sleep]]. These side effects are more likely at higher doses (above 0.5–1&nbsp;mg).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nicholson |first1=AN |last2=Stone |first2=BM |last3=Pascoe |first3=PA |title=Studies on sleep and performance with a triazolo-1, 4-thienodiazepine (brotizolam) |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=75–81 |year=1980 |pmid=7397057 |pmc=1430017 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1980.tb00504.x}}</ref>

 


 
In clinical trials brotizolam 0.125 to 0.5&nbsp;mg improved sleep in insomniacs similarly to [[nitrazepam]] 2.5 and 5&nbsp;mg, [[flunitrazepam]] 2&nbsp;mg and [[triazolam]] 0.25&nbsp;mg, whilst brotizolam 0.5&nbsp;mg was shown to be superior to [[flurazepam]] 30&nbsp;mg, but inferior to [[temazepam]] 30&nbsp;mg in some studies. Brotizolam at dosages below 0.5&nbsp;mg at night usually produced minimal morning drowsiness; no residual impairment of psychomotor performance occurs following dosages within the recommended range of 0.125 to 0.25&nbsp;mg. No serious side effects have been reported to date and the most frequently observed adverse experiences are drowsiness, headache and dizziness. Mild rebound insomnia may occur in some patients when treatment is stopped.<ref name="pmid3281819"/>
