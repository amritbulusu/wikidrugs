{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

 


 
As drostanolone does not aromatize at any dose, typical [[estrogen]]-linked side effects encountered when using other [[anabolic steroid]]s, like water retention, gynecomastia, and elevated blood pressure are not observed.

 


 
However, [[androgenic]] effects such as accelerated [[Hair loss|alopecia]] and [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] can appear. In women, drostanolone can cause [[virilization]] when used in high doses. Drostanolone can also cause a decrease in [[Hdl cholesterol|HDL cholesterol]] and an increase in [[Ldl cholesterol|LDL cholesterol]]. As drostanolone also suppresses natural [[testosterone]] production, additional testosterone therapy and post-cycle therapy should be considered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim901.htm#SectionTitle:7.7%2520%2520Main%2520adverse%2520effects|title=Drostanolone (PIM 901)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref>
