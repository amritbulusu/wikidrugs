[[Image:VIOXX sample blister pack.jpg|right|100px]]Aside from the reduced incidence of gastric ulceration, rofecoxib exhibits a similar adverse effect profile to other [[NSAID]]s.

 
Prostaglandin is a large family of lipids. Prostaglandin I2/PGI2/prostacyclin is just one member of it. Prostaglandins other than PGI2 (such as PGE2) also play important roles in vascular tone regulation. Prostacyclin/thromboxane are produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, and rofecoxib suppresses just COX-2 enzyme, so there is no reason to believe that prostacyclin levels are significantly reduced by the drug. And there is no reason to believe that only the balance between quantities of prostacyclin and thromboxane is the determinant factor for vascular tone.<ref>{{Cite journal
