Very common (greater than 10%) adverse effects include [[tachycardia|fast heart beats]] and nausea.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

 
Common (between 1% and 10%) adverse effects include tremor, headache, transient [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], vomiting, increased sweating, sepsis, sinus and nodal [[bradycardia|slow heart beat]], cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, cardiac enzyme changes, non-specific ECG changes, [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and kidney failure.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

 


 
Like other ß2-agonists, dopexamine lowers potassium levels and raises glucose levels, so there is a risk of exacerbating [[hypokalaemia]] or [[hyperglycaemia]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

 


 
People can develop [[drug tolerance]] to dopexamine if it is administered over a long period of time, as with other  catecholamines.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

 


 
Dopexamine may potentiate the effects of other catecholamines like [[noradrenaline]].    Effects of depexamine may be suppressed by concomitant use with  ß2-adrenergic and dopamine receptor antagonists requires caution.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>
