Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and [[alcohol withdrawal]]. [[Withdrawal symptoms]] are more likely if baclofen is used for long periods of time (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be stopped by recommencing baclofen.<ref name="dawbw">{{cite journal
