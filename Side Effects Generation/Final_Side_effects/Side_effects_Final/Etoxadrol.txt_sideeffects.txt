Like [[ketamine]], etoxadrol produces increases in [[heart rate]] and [[respiratory rate]].<ref name=traber /> Etoxadrol may also cause [[vomiting]].<ref name=Fredrickson /> At high enough [[dose (biochemistry)|doses]], etoxadrol also exhibits effects on the [[muscular system]] such as [[convulsions]] or loss of the [[righting reflex]].<ref name=Hidalgo4994714>{{cite journal|last=Hidalgo|first=J |author2=Dileo, RM |author3=Rikimaru, MT |author4=Guzman, RJ |author5=Thompson, CR|title=Etoxadrol (CL-1848C) a new dissociative anesthetic: studies in primates and other species.|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=Mar–Apr 1971|volume=50|issue=2|pages=231–9|pmid=4994714|doi=10.1213/00000539-197103000-00016}}</ref> When administered in excess, etoxadrol can be [[Lethal dose|lethal]] on the [[respiratory system]].

Etoxadrol produces a wide variety of [[dreams]], ranging from pleasant to frightening or aversive.<ref name=wilson /> Approximately half of patients given etoxadrol report pleasant dreams, 25% report unpleasant dreams, and the remaining 25% experience no dreams at all. Such dreams were frequently described as “floating,” “puffy” or “out of this world."  Dreams and [[hallucinations]] may persist for as long as 18 to 24 hours. In rare cases, etoxadrol can induce periods of [[psychosis|psychotic activity]] during this recovery period.<ref name=Fredrickson />

 
 

 
In the [[brain]], etoxadrol slows down the [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[serotonin]] to 50-60% of control rates and speeds up the rate of [[dopamine]] synthesis by up to 200% of the normal rate 4–6 hours after [[intravenous therapy|intravenous administration]].<ref name=Fredrickson />

 


 
Like a number of other [[drugs]] (e.g. [[cocaine]]), etoxadrol has been found to exhibit [[reinforcement|reinforcing properties]]. [[Monkeys]] will self-administer etoxadrol, [[dexoxadrol]] or [[phencyclidine|PCP]] in a lever-pressing paradigm.<ref name="Brady 56–62"/>
