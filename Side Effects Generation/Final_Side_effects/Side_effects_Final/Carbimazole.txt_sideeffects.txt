Whilst [[rash]]es and [[pruritus]] are common, these can often be treated with [[antihistamine]]s without stopping the carbimazole. For those patients where sensitivity reactions can not be controlled, [[propylthiouracil]] may be used as an alternative; cross-sensitivity between these drugs is rare.

 


 
Its most serious rare side effect is [[bone marrow suppression]] causing [[neutropenia]] and [[agranulocytosis]]. This may occur at any stage during treatment and without warning; monitoring of white cell count is not useful. Patients are advised to immediately report symptoms of infection, such as [[Pharyngitis|sore throat]] or fever, so that a [[full blood count]] test may be arranged. If this confirms a low neutrophil count, discontinuation of the drug leads to recovery. However failure to report suggestive symptoms or delays in  considering the possibility of immunosuppression and its testing, can lead to fatalities.
