[[Neutropenia]] and [[myelosuppression]] were common toxic effects. Fifteen people (of 84, i.e. 18%) in the above-mentioned study developed [[pleural effusion]]s, which were felt to be a side effect of dasatinib. Some of these people required [[thoracentesis]] or [[pleurodesis]] to treat the effusions. Other adverse events included mild to moderate diarrhea, peripheral [[edema]], and [[headache]]. A small number of people developed abnormal [[liver function tests]] which returned to normal without dose adjustments. Mild [[hypocalcemia]] was also noted, but did not appear to cause any significant problems. Several cases of [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]] (PAH) were found in people treated with dasatinib.<ref>[http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/News/2011---August/16/Healthcare-professional-communication-regarding-association-of-dasatinib-Sprycel-with-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension/ NHS - Healthcare News]</ref>

 


 
On October 11, 2011 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced that dasatinib may increase the risk of a rare but serious condition in which there is abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs ([[pulmonary hypertension]], PAH). Symptoms of PAH may include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling of the body (such as the ankles and legs). In reported cases, people developed PAH after starting dasatinib, including after more than one year of treatment.

 


 
Information about this risk has been added to the Warnings and Precautions section of the Sprycel drug label.<ref>FDA: [http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm275176.htm Sprycel (dasatinib): Drug Safety Communication - Risk of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension], 10/11/2011.</ref>
