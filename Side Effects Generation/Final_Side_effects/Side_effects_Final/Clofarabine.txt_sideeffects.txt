* [[Tumor lysis syndrome]] (TLS). Clofarabine quickly kills leukaemia cells in the blood. The body may react to this. Signs include hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia.  TLS is very serious and can lead to death if it is not treated right away.

 
* Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): symptoms include fast breathing, fast heartbeat, low blood pressure, and fluid in the lungs. 

 
*Bone marrow problems (suppression). Clofarabine can stop the bone marrow from making enough [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], and [[platelets]]. Serious side effects that can happen because of bone marrow suppression include severe infection ([[sepsis]]), bleeding, and [[anemia]].

 
*Effects on [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]]. Girls and women should not become pregnant or breastfeed during treatment which may harm the baby.

 
*[[Dehydration]] and [[low blood pressure]]. Clofarabine can cause [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] which may lead to low body fluid (dehydration). Signs and symptoms of dehydration include dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells, or decreased [[urination]].

 
*Other side effects. The most common side effects are stomach problems (including vomiting, diarrhea, and [[nausea]]), and effects on blood cells (including low red blood cells count, low white blood cell count, low platelet count, [[fever]], and infection. Clofarabine can also cause [[tachycardia]] and can affect the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]].
