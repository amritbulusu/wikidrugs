Adverse effects of clorazepate include, [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[drug dependence|dependence]], [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] reactions, cognitive impairment, [[confusion]], [[anterograde amnesia]], falls in the elderly, [[ataxia]], hangover effects, and drowsiness. It is unclear whether cognitive deficits resulting from the [[long-term use of benzodiazepines]] return to normal or persist indefinitely after withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are also known to cause or worsen [[Major depression|depression]]. [[Paradoxical effects]] including excitement and paradoxical worsening of seizures can sometimes result from the use of benzodiazepines. Children, the elderly, individuals with a history of [[alcohol abuse]] or a history of aggressive behavior and anger are at greater risk of developing paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines.<ref name="Riss-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Riss | first1 = J. | last2 = Cloyd | first2 = J. | last3 = Gates | first3 = J. | last4 = Collins | first4 = S. | title = Benzodiazepines in epilepsy: pharmacology and pharmacokinetics | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/120119477/PDFSTART | format = PDF | journal = Acta Neurol Scand | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 69â€“86 |date=Aug 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2008.01004.x | pmid = 18384456 }}</ref>
