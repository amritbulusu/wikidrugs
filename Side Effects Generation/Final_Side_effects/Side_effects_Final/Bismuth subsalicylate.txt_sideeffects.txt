Children should not take medication with bismuth subsalicylate while recovering from [[influenza]] or [[chicken pox]], as epidemiologic evidence points to an association between the use of [[salicylate]]-containing medications during certain viral infections and the onset of [[Reye's syndrome]].<ref>[http://www.reyessyndrome.org/pdfs/medicationscontainingaspirin.pdf Aspirin or Salicylate-Containing Medications], reyessyndrome.org</ref> For the same reason, it is typically recommended that nursing mothers not use medication containing bismuth subsalicylate because small amounts of the medication are excreted in human breast milk, and these pose a theoretical risk of Reye's syndrome to nursing children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/food_illness.htm|title=Food-borne and Waterborne Illness   - Breastfeeding – CDC|work=cdc.gov}}</ref>
