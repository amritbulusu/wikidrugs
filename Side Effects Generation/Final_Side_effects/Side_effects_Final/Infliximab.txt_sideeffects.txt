Infliximab has adverse effects, some life-threatening, common to drugs in the class of [[TNF inhibitor|TNF inhibiting]] [[immunosuppressants]] (which also includes etanercept ([[Enbrel]]) and adalimumab ([[Humira]])). Some of the most severe are:

 


 
*serious [[infection]]s

 
*reactivation of [[hepatitis B]]

 
*reactivation of [[tuberculosis]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keane J, Gershon S, Wise RP, Mirabile-Levens E, Kasznica J, Schwieterman WD, Siegel JN, Braun MM | title = Tuberculosis associated with infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor &alpha;–neutralizing agent | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 345 | issue = 15 | pages = 1098–1104 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11596589 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa011110 | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa011110#t=articleResults}}</ref>

 
*lethal [[hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma]] (generally only when combined with 6-mercaptopurine)

 
*drug-induced [[lupus]]

 
*[[demyelinating]] [[central nervous system]] disorders

 
*[[psoriasis]] and psoriasiform skin lesions

 
*new-onset [[vitiligo]]

 


 
Cases of [[leukopenia]], [[neutropenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], and [[pancytopenia]] (some fatal) have been reported with infliximab.<ref>[http://www.remicade.com/remicade/global/hcp/healthcare_professionals.html Remicade for Healthcare Professionals]</ref> The FDA issued a warning to doctors appearing in the respective product labeling of infliximab instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/May_PIs/Remicade_PI.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009085444/http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/May_PIs/Remicade_PI.pdf |date=October 9, 2006 }}</ref> The FDA issued a warning to doctors that there is an increased risk of lymphoma and other cancers associated with the use of infliximab and other tumor necrosis factor blockers in children and adolescents.<ref>

Maintenance therapy with the drug (versus intermittent or sporadic therapy) lessens the likelihood of developing antibodies to infliximab which are known to reduce the efficacy of the drug.  Combination treatment with [[methotrexate]] (an antifolate drug which suppresses the immune system) has been shown to reduce the formation of these antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maini R, St Clair EW, Breedveld F, Furst D, Kalden J, Weisman M, Smolen J, Emery P, Harriman G, Feldmann M, Lipsky P | title = Infliximab (chimeric anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody) versus placebo in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving concomitant methotrexate: a randomised phase III trial.

Infliximab was studied in monotherapy (without concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or [[azathioprine]]) in [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], and [[ankylosing spondylitis]].<ref name="Maxwell" /> Only its use in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] requires the concomitant use of methotrexate by FDA product labeling; however, the concomitant use of methotrexate in other disease states may help to reduce the body's immune response to the infliximab and increase its duration of efficacy.
