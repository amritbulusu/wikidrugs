As with other opioid analgesics, central nervous system effects (such as [[sedation]], [[mental confusion|confusion]], and [[dizziness]]) are considerations with butorphanol. [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are common. Less common are the gastrointestinal effects of other opioids (mostly constipation).  Another side effect experienced by people taking the medication is increased perspiration.
