Because of etomidate-induced adrenal suppression, its use for patients with sepsis is controversial. Cortisol levels have been reported to be suppressed up to 72 hours after a single bolus of etomidate in this population at risk for adrenal insufficiency.<ref name="Hohl"/> For this reason, many authors have suggested that etomidate should never be used for critically ill patients with septic shock<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=C|last2=McAllister|first2=C|year=2005|title=Etomidate for emergency anaesthesia; mad, bad and dangerous to know?|journal=Anaesthesia|volume=60|issue=8|pages=737–740|pmid=16029220|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2005.04325.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=WL|year=2005|title=Should we use etomidate as an induction agent for endotracheal intubation in patients with septic shock?

In a retrospective review of almost 32,000 people, etomidate, when used for the induction of anaesthesia, was associated 2.5-fold increase in the risk of dying compared with those given [[propofol]].<ref name = retro/> People given etomidate also had significantly greater odds of having cardiovascular morbidity and significantly longer hospital stay.<ref name = retro/> These results, especially given the large size of study, strongly suggest that, at the very least, clinicians should use etomidate judiciously.<ref name = retro>{{cite journal|last1=Komatsu|first1=R|last2=You|first2=J|last3=Mascha|first3=EJ|last4=Sessler|first4=DI|last5=Kasuya|first5=Y|last6=Turan|first6=A|title=Anesthetic induction with etomidate, rather than propofol, is associated with increased 30-day mortality and cardiovascular morbidity after noncardiac surgery.|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=December 2013|volume=117|issue=6|pages=1329–37|doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e318299a516|pmid=24257383}}</ref>

 


 
In people with traumatic brain injury, etomidate use is associated with a blunting of an [[ACTH stimulation test]].<ref name="Archambault 270–82"/> The clinical impact of this effect has yet to be determined.

 


 
In addition, concurrent use of etomidate with [[opioids]] and/or [[benzodiazepines]], is hypothesized to exacerbate etomidate-related adrenal insufficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Daniell|first1= Harry|title= Opioid and benzodiazepine contributions to etomidate-associated adrenal insufficiency|journal= Intensive Care Medicine|volume= 34|pages= 2117–8|year= 2008 |doi= 10.1007/s00134-008-1264-8|issue= 11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daniell|first1=HW|year=2008|title=Opioid contribution to decreased cortisol levels in critical care patients|journal=Arch Surg|volume=143|issue=12|pages=1147–1148|pmid=19075164|doi=10.1001/archsurg.143.12.1147}}</ref> However, only retrospective evidence of this effect exists and prospective studies are needed to measure the clinical impact of this interaction.
