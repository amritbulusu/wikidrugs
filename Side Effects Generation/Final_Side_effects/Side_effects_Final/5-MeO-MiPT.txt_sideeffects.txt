This is an analogue of the more popular drug [[5-MeO-DiPT]] (nicknamed "foxy methoxy") and has the nickname "moxy". Some users report the tactile effects of 5-MeO-DiPT without some of the unwanted side effects.  At higher doses it becomes much more psychedelic sometimes being compared to 5-MeO-DMT. But at doses of 4-10 milligrams users find 5-MeO-MiPT to be a very euphoric and tactile chemical. Its energetic effects can be very strong at high doses, increasing normal heart rate considerably. Sounds can be amplified in perception to a point where [[synesthetic]] effects ("touching or/and tasting sounds") occur.
