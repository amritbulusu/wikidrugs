Methylone substitutes for MDMA in rats trained to discriminate MDMA from [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]. Methylone does not substitute for amphetamine or for the hallucinogenic DOM in animals trained to discriminate between these drugs and saline.<ref>TA Dal Cason, R Young, RA Glennon. Cathinone: an investigation of several N-alkyl and methylenedioxy-substituted analogs. ''Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 58'', 1109â€“1116 (1997)</ref> Further, also in common with MDMA, methylone acts on monoaminergic systems. ''[[In vitro]]'', methylone has one third the potency of MDMA at inhibiting platelet serotonin accumulation and about the same in its inhibiting effects on the dopamine and noradrenaline transporters.<ref>NV Cozzi, MK Sievert, AT Shulgin, P Jacob III, AE Ruoho.

In spite of these behavioral and pharmacological similarities between methylone and MDMA, the observed subjective effects of both drugs are not completely identical.
