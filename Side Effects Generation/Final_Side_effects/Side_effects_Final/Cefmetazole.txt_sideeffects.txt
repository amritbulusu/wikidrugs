The chemical structure of cefmetazole, like that of several other cephalosporins, contains an ''N''-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) [[side chain]]. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause [[hypoprothrombinemia]] (likely due to [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of the [[enzyme]] [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]]) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by [[disulfiram]], due to inhibition of [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]].<ref name=Goldfrank>{{cite book |author=Stork CM |veditors=Nelson LH, Flomenbaum N, Goldfrank LR, Hoffman RL, Howland MD, Lewin NA |title=Goldfrank's toxicologic emergencies |chapter=Antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvJuLqBxGUcC&pg=PA847 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2006 |pages=847 |isbn=0-07-143763-0 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref>
