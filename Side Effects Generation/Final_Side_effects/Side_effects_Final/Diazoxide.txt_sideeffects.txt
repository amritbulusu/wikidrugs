Diazoxide interferes with insulin release through its action on potassium channels.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Control of insulin secretion by sulfonylureas, meglitinide and diazoxide in relation to their binding to the sulfonylurea receptor in pancreatic islets|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006295289903274|journal = Biochemical Pharmacology|date = 1989-04-15|pages = 1217–1229|volume = 38|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90327-4|first = Uwe|last = Panten|first2 = Johanna|last2 = Burgfeld|first3 = Frank|last3 = Goerke|first4 = Michael|last4 = Rennicke|first5 = Mathias|last5 = Schwanstecher|first6 = Andreas|last6 = Wallasch|first7 = Bernd J.|last7 = Zünkler|first8 = Sigurd|last8 = Lenzen}}</ref> Diazoxide is one of the most potent openers of the K+ ATP channels present on the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. Opening these channels leads to hyperpolarization of cell membrane, a decrease in calcium influx, and a subsequently reduced release of insulin.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacological Agents That Directly Modulate Insulin Secretion|url = http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/55/1/105|journal = Pharmacological Reviews|date = 2003-03-01|issn = 1521-0081|pmid = 12615955|pages = 105–131|volume = 55|issue = 1|doi = 10.1124/pr.55.1.7|language = en|first = Máire E.|last = Doyle|first2 = Josephine M.|last2 = Egan}}</ref> This mechanism of action is the mirror opposite of that of [[sulfonylurea]]s, a class of medications used to increase insulin release in [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetics]]. Therefore, this medicine is not given to non-insulin dependent diabetic patients.
