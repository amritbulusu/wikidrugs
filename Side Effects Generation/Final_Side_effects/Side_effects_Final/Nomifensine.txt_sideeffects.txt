During treatment with nomifensine there were relatively few adverse effects, mainly [[Kidney failure|renal failure]], paranoid symptoms, [[Somnolence|drowsiness]] or [[insomnia]], [[headache]], and [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]]. Side effects affecting the cardiovascular system included [[tachycardia]] and [[palpitations]], but nomifensine was significantly less cardiotoxic than the standard tricyclic antidepressants.<ref name="pmid911653">{{cite journal |author=Hanks GW |title=A profile of nomifensine |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=4Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=243S–248S |year=1977 |pmid=911653 |pmc=1429121 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1977.tb05760.x |url= }}</ref>
