Several reactions have been noted in manufacturer guidelines — deep sleep, incoordination, sedation, calmness, and dizziness have been reported in children and adults, as well as others such as [[hypotension]], [[tinnitus]], and headaches.<ref name="manufact_sa">UCB South-Africa, et al., (2004)</ref> [[Gastro-intestinal]] effects have also been observed, as well as less serious effects such as dryness of the mouth and constipation caused by the mild [[antimuscarinic]] properties of hydroxyzine.<ref name="manufact_sa" />

 


 
Central nervous system problems such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to overdosage.<ref name="fda_vistaril_3" /><ref name="manufact_sa" />  Such properties have been attributed to hydroxyzine in several cases, particularly in patients treated for neuropsychological disorders, as well as in cases where overdoses have been observed. While there are reports of the "hallucinogenic" or "hypnotic" properties of hydroxyzine, several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of hydroxyzine, but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the [[formatio reticularis]]. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an additional effect from overall [[central nervous system]] suppression by other CNS agents, such as [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] or [[ethanol]].<ref>''Anderson, P. O., Knoben, J. E., et al.'' (2002), p794-796</ref>

 


 
The effect of hydroxyzine has also been tested on the ability of humans in the registration and storage of memory, and was used in comparison with relatively safe drugs, such as lorazepam, to illustrate the effects of benzodiazepines, which are thought to have adverse effects on the capacity of memory storage. Hydroxyzine was found to have no adverse effects on memory in relation to [[lorazepam]], which caused several deficiencies in the capacity of memory storage.<ref name="brabander_p1">Brabander, A. DE, Debert, W., (1990), p1</ref>

 


 
In a comparative study with lorazepam on memory effects, patients who had taken hydroxyzine experienced sedative effects like drowsiness, but recalled that they felt capable, attentive and able to continue with a memory test under these conditions.<ref name="brabander_p3">Brabander, A. DE, Debert, W., (1990), p3</ref>  Conversely, those under the effects of lorazepam felt unable to continue due to the fact they felt out of control with its effects; 8 out of 10 patients describing tendencies of problems with balance and control of simple motor functions.<ref name="brabander_p3" />

 


 
[[Somnolence]] with or without vivid dreams or nightmares may occur in users with antihistamine sensitivities in combination with other CNS depressants. Hydroxyzine exhibits [[anxiolytic]] and [[sedative]] properties in many psychiatric patients. Other studies have suggested that hydroxyzine acts as an acute hypnotic, reducing [[sleep onset latency]] and increasing sleep duration — also showing that some drowsiness did occur. This was observed more in female patients, who also had greater hypnotic response.<ref name="hydroxy_sleep">Alford, C.; N. Rombautt, J. Jones, S. Foley, C. Idzikowskit and I. Hindmarch (1992).</ref>

 


 
Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly.<ref>NCQA’s HEDIS Measure: Use of High Risk Medications in the Elderly, {{cite web|url=http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201113909/http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-01 |df= }}</ref>

 


 
In 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) announced a small but definite risk of QT prolongation associated with the use of hydroxyzine.

 
This side effect is more likely to occur in people with pre-existing cardiac disease, or with the use of other medicines known to prolong the QT interval.
