Like other fluoroquinolones, difloxacin causes arthropathy in immature growing animals, particularly dogs.  Otherwise, it is very well tolerated.  The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal effects such as vomiting, diarrhea and anorexia, even in overdose.  Only supportive measures, and not additional treatment, are recommended for management of overdose or toxicity as the reactions are self-limiting.

 


 
Contraindications include small and medium breeds of dogs that are less than 8 months old; large breeds less than 12 months old; giant breeds less than 18 months old; those with suspected CNS disorders; and hypersensitivity to difloxacin or any other fluoroquinolone.<ref name=":4" />
