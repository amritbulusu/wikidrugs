Headache was the only reported side effect to occur at a frequency greater than 5 percentage points above those from placebo. Other reported side effects and their rates for lorcaserin and placebo patients, respectively, were as follows: [[upper respiratory tract infection]] (14.8% vs. 11.9%), [[nasopharyngitis]] (13.4% vs. 12.0%), [[sinusitis]] (7.2% vs. 8.2%), and [[nausea]] (7.5% vs. 5.4%). Adverse events of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[suicidal ideation]] were infrequent and were reported at a similar rate in each treatment group.

In December 2012, the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] proposed classifying lorcaserin as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV controlled substances|Schedule IV]] drug because it has hallucinogenic properties at higher than approved doses and users could develop psychiatric dependencies on the drug.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Megan R.|title=Reg Watch|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/273901-reg-watch|newspaper=The Hill|date=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Lorcaserin into Schedule IV|url=https://federalregister.gov/a/2012-30531}}</ref> On 7 May 2013, the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] classified lorcaserin as a Schedule IV drug<ref name="ofr"/> under the [[Controlled Substances Act]].<ref name="Wilson"/>

 


 
There has been concern that lorcaserin can cause [[cardiac valvulopathy]] based upon the reports of subjects taking the drug in Phase 2 trials. However, a Phase 3 clinical trial of the drug was conducted and the results published in the October 2014 Postgraduate Medicine journal, a peer-reviewed medical journal for physicians. These results found no statistically significant differences in valvulopathy rates compared to control, being 2.4% for the drug subjects and 2.0% for controls.<ref>http://www.belviqhcp.com/resources/</ref>
