Carbenoxolone has also been investigated for [[nootropic]] effects.<ref name="pmid15071189">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sandeep TC, Yau JL, MacLullich AM |title=11Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibition improves cognitive function in healthy elderly men and type 2 diabetics |journal=Proc.

Carbenoxolone may decrease the amount of active glucocortocoid in the brain, because the drug inhibits 11β-HSD, an enzyme which regenerates [[cortisol]], an active glucocorticoid, from inactive [[cortisone]].

 


 
In the research trial investigating this use of carbenoloxone, it was shown that the drug improved verbal fluency in elderly healthy men (aged 55–75). In type 2 diabetics aged 52–70, the drug improved verbal memory. However, [[potassium-sparing diuretic]] [[amiloride]] was co-administered with carbenoxolone, since carbenoxolone used by itself may cause [[hypertension]] by increasing cortisol in the kidneys.
