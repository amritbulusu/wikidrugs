Most common side-effects are gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Headache and disturbances in taste also occur. Less common side-effects include palpitations, blurred vision, and rashes.  Prolonged [[QTc]] intervals may also be caused by telithromycin.<ref>Bertram G. Katzung, Susan B. Masters, Anthony J.

Rare but severe side-effects were initially reported in March 2006, involving damage to the liver.<ref name="Clay KD 2006">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Clay KD, etal | title=Brief communication: severe hepatotoxicity of telithromycin: three case reports and literature review | journal=Annals of Internal Medicine | year=2006 | volume=144 | pages=415â€“420 | pmid=16481451 | issue=6 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-144-6-200503210-00121}}</ref> Three different incidents were reported: one case of temporary drug-induced [[hepatitis]], one ending in a [[liver transplant]], and one ending in death.

 


 
In the United States, the FDA's Office of Epidemiology and Surveillance identified 12 cases of acute liver failure, resulting in four deaths, and an additional 23 cases of acute, serious liver injury, among 5.2 million patients taking telithromycin through April 2006.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/AC/06/slides/2006-4266s1-01-07-FDA-Brinker.ppt</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB114644463095840108 |title=Fraud, Errors Taint Key Study Of Widely Used Sanofi Drug - WSJ |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

 


 
In 2010, a published report described the likely mechanism of action underlying not only the cases of liver failure but also cases of visual disturbances and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis.  The study showed that a pyridine moiety that is part of the telithromycin molecule acts as an antagonist on cholinergic receptors located in the neuromuscular junction, the ciliary ganglion of the eye and the vagus nerve innervating the liver.  Other macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin and the fluoroketolide, [[solithromycin]], do not contain the pyridine  moiety and do not antagonize these cholinergic receptors significantly.<ref>D Bertrand, S Bertrand, E Neveu, and P Fernandes (2010).
