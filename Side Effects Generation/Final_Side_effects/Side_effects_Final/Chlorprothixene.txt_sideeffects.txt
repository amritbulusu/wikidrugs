Chlorprothixene has a strong sedative activity with a high incidence of [[anticholinergic]] side effects. The types of side effects encountered (dry mouth, massive [[hypotension]] and [[tachycardia]], [[hyperhidrosis]], substantial weight gain etc.) normally do not allow a full effective dose for the remission of psychotic disorders to be given. So cotreatment with another, more potent, antipsychotic agent is needed.

 


 
Chlorprothixene is structurally related to [[chlorpromazine]], with which it shares, in principle, all side effects. Allergic side effects and liver damage seem to appear with an appreciable lower frequency. The elderly are particularly sensitive to anticholinergic side effects of chlorprothixene (precipitation of narrow angle [[glaucoma]], severe obstipation, difficulties in urinating, confusional and delirant states). In patients >60 years the doses should be particularly low.

 


 
Early and late [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]] may occur but have been noted with a low frequency (one study with a great number of participants has delivered a total number of only 1%).
