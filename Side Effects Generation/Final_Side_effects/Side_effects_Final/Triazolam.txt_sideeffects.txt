Triazolam, although a short-acting benzodiazepine, may cause residual impairment into the next day, especially the next morning. A [[meta-analysis]] demonstrated that residual "hangover" effects after nighttime administration of triazolam such as sleepiness, psychomotor impairment, and diminished [[cognitive]] functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and [[hip fractures]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vermeeren A. | year = 2004 | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs. | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–328 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref> [[Confusion]] and [[amnesia]] have been reported.<ref>{{ cite journal |pmid=2068441 |url= |format= |year=1991 |last1=Lieberherr |first1=S |last2=Scollo-Lavizzari |first2=G |last3=Battegay |first3=R |title=Confusional states following administration of short-acting benzodiazepines (midazolam/triazolam) |volume=80 |issue=24 |pages=673–5 |journal=Schweizerische Rundschau fur Medizin Praxis = Revue suisse de médecine Praxis }}</ref>
