As a member of the phenothiazine type of antipsychotics, perphenazine shares in general all allergic and toxic side-effects of [[chlorpromazine]].  A 2015 systematic review of the data on perphenazine conducted by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that "there were no convincing differences between perphenazine and other antipsychotics" in the incidence of adverse effects.<ref name=Har2015/>Perphenazine causes early and late [[extrapyramidal side effect]]s more often than [[placebo]], and at a similar rate to other medium-potency antipsychotics<ref name="Kels">{{cite book

When used for its strong [[antiemetic]] or [[antivertignosic]] effects in cases with associated brain injuries, it may obscure the clinical course and interferes with the diagnosis.  High doses of perphenazine can cause temporary dyskinesia.  As with other typical antipsychotics, permanent or lasting [[tardive dyskinesia]] is a risk.
