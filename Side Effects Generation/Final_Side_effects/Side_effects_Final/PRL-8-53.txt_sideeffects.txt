A single study in humans was reported in 1978.  The [[double-blind]] trial of PRL-8-53 in 47 healthy volunteers measured its effects on a variety of cognitive measures. 5&nbsp;mg of the drug was administered orally 2â€“2.5 hours before the study tasks.<ref name="trial" /> Overall improvements in recollection differed based on how many words were recalled under placebo, with the poor performers (six words or fewer) experiencing a 87.5-105% increase in recollection and the high performers (eight or more words) a 7.9-14% increase which failed to reach statistical significance; when controlling for subjects over the age of 30 only, a 108-152% increase was noted. The researchers noted that this was likely a result of a ceiling effect due to many of their subjects scoring close to 100% on the recall test even on placebo.<ref name="trial" /> No side effects were reported during the trial.<ref name="trial" />
