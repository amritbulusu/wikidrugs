The EPA and WHO both classify lindane as "moderately" acutely toxic. It has an oral {{LD50}} of 88&nbsp;mg/kg in rats and a dermal LD<sub>50</sub> of 1000&nbsp;mg/kg. Most of the adverse human health effects reported for lindane have been related to agricultural uses and chronic, occupational exposure of seed-treatment workers.<ref name="r16">Persistent Organic Pollutant Review Committee (POPRC).

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] have set occupational exposure limits ([[Permissible exposure limit|permissible exposure]] and [[Recommended exposure limit|recommended exposure]], respectively) for lindane at 0.5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> at a time-weighted average of eight hours for skin exposure. People can be exposed to lindane in the workplace by inhaling it, absorbing it through their skin, swallowing it, and eye contact. At levels of 50&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>, lindane is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Lindane|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0370.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref>
