The side effects of zaleplon are similar to the side effects of benzodiazepines, although with less next-day sedation,<ref name="Wagner J 1998 680–91">{{cite journal | doi =10.1345/aph.17111 | journal =Ann Pharmacother |date=June 1998 | pages =680–91  | title =Beyond benzodiazepines: alternative pharmacologic agents for the treatment of insomnia | author =Wagner J |author2=Wagner ML |author3=Hening WA  | pmid =9640488 | volume =32 | issue =6 }}</ref> and in two studies zaleplon use was found not to cause an increase in traffic accidents, as compared to other [[hypnotics]] currently on the market.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Menzin J, Lang KM, Levy P, Levy E |title=A general model of the effects of sleep medications on the risk and cost of [[motor vehicle accidents]] and its application to France |journal=PharmacoEconomics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=69–78 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11252547 |doi= 10.2165/00019053-200119010-00005|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vermeeren A, Riedel WJ, van Boxtel MP, Darwish M, Paty I, Patat A |title=Differential residual effects of zaleplon and zopiclone on actual driving: a comparison with a low dose of alcohol |journal=Sleep |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=224–31 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11905433 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

 


 
Available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence of [[Substance dependence|dependence]] during treatment at recommended doses of zaleplon (typically 5–20&nbsp;mg before bed).  Other sedative/hypnotics have been associated with various signs and symptoms of a withdrawal syndrome, following abrupt discontinuation, ranging from mild [[dysphoria]] and insomnia to more serious cases that include abdominal and [[muscle cramps]], [[vomiting]], [[sweating]], [[tremor]]s, and [[convulsions]]. Following abrupt cessation, the [[seizure threshold]] is further lowered, wherein [[coma]] and death are possible outcomes if untreated.

 


 
Some evidence suggests zaleplon is not as chemically reinforcing and exhibits far fewer [[rebound effects]] when compared with other nonbenzodiazepines, or [[Z-drug]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lader MH |title=Implications of hypnotic flexibility on patterns of clinical use |journal=Int J Clin Pract Suppl |volume= |issue=116 |pages=14–9 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11219327 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
