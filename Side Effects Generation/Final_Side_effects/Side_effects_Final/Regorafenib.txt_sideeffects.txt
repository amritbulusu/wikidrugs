Regorafenib is being approved with a Boxed Warning alerting patients and health care professionals that severe and fatal liver toxicity occurred in patients treated with regorafenib during clinical studies. Serious side effects, which occurred in less than one percent of patients, were liver damage, severe bleeding, blistering and peeling of skin, very high blood pressures requiring emergency treatment, heart attacks and perforations (holes) in the intestines. The most common side effects reported in patients treated with regorafenib include weakness or fatigue, loss of appetite, [[hand-foot syndrome]] (also called palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), diarrhoea, mouth sores (mucousitis), weight loss, infection, high blood pressure, and changes in voice volume or quality ([[dysphonia]]).<ref>{{cite web | title=FDA Prescribing Information | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/203085lbl.pdf |date=27 Sep 2012}}</ref>
