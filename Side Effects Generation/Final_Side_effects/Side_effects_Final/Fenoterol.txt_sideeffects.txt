Fenoterol is a short-acting β<sub>2</sub> agonist, which also stimulates [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub> receptor]]s at doses above the recommended therapeutic doses. It was widely used in [[New Zealand]] in the early 1990s but withdrawn from that market<ref name="pmid7613161">{{cite journal |vauthors=Beasley R, Pearce N, Crane J, Burgess C |title=Withdrawal of fenoterol and the end of the New Zealand asthma mortality epidemic |journal=International Archives of Allergy and Immunology |volume=107 |issue=1-3 |pages=325–7 |year=1995 |pmid=7613161 |doi= 10.1159/000237016|url=}}</ref> because of its association with an excess number of deaths.

 


 
It is thought that the association of increased risk of death was because it was typically used in excessively large doses for severe acute asthma attacks<ref name="pmid1346340">{{cite journal |vauthors=Spitzer WO, Suissa S, Ernst P |title=The use of beta-agonists and the risk of death and near death from asthma |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=326 |issue=8 |pages=501–6 |date=February 1992 |pmid=1346340 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199202203260801|url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> in the absence of medical assistance. Instances were known of patients who had used up to 80 puffs before seeking medical attention. Both excessive prescribed doses and patient's excessive self-medication with β agonists in acute asthma not responding to usual doses, are now generally recognized as undesirable with all β agonist asthma inhalers.
