As of October 2016 the three Phase III clinical trials of ocrelizumab used to obtain approval had not been published. Based on published data from clinical trials at that time, the most common adverse events were infusion reactions including itchy skin, rash, [[urticaria|hives]], flushing, throat and mouth irritation, fever, fatigue, nausea, [[tachycardia|rapid heart beating]], headache, and dizziness.  One person died from a [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] and in another trial, rates of cancer were three times higher (2.3% vs 0.8%) in people taking the drug than people taking placebo.  Clinical trials in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[lupus]] were halted because rates of serious infections were too high; these results were not seen in published trials in people with MS, and the differences may be due to the differences in the bodies of people with the different diseases, as well as other drugs they were taking.<ref name=McGinley2017rev/>

 


 
There is an increased risk of infections of all kinds, including respiratory infections, in people taking [[immunosupressive drug]]s like ocrelizumab; however, in clinical trials submitted to the FDA, more people taking ocrelizumab got infections than people taking [[Interferon beta-1a]] did, including upper and lower respiratory infections, herpes, and hepatitis B reactivation; the risk of [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]], a disease caused by viral infection of the brain, is also increased.<ref name=FDAlabel2017/>

 


 
There is an increased risk of breast cancer with ocrelizumab; 6 of 781 females with MS who participated in clinical trials submitted to the FDA developed breast cancer, while none of the 668 females in the other arms of the clinical trials developed breast cancer.<ref name=FDAlabel2017/>
