The US label carries a [[black box warning]] of the risk of drug causing [[liver toxicity]], in particular [[hepatic veno-occlusive disease]] (VOD), which has been fatal in some people.   The risk of this is higher in people who take the drug before having [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT) and more people die who have HSCT following treatment with this drug, than people who have HSCT taking other chemotherapies.  The risk gets higher as more rounds of treatment with Inotuzumab ozogamicin are administered.<ref name=USlabel/>
