The adverse effects of pethidine administration are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, diaphoresis, urinary retention, and constipation. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause [[miosis]] because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, [[obtundation]], cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma. A narcotic antagonist such as [[naloxone]] is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of pethidine. Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]]. Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral pethidine on a chronic basis have been attributed to accumumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous pethidine overdose.<ref>Baselt, R. (2008). ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'' (8 ed.).
