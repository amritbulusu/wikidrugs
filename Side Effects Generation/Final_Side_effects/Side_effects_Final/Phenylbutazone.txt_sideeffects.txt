Side effects of phenylbutazone are similar to those of other NSAIDs. Overdose or prolonged use can cause [[Equine gastric ulcer syndrome|gastrointestinal ulcers]], [[blood dyscrasia]], [[kidney]] damage (primarily dose-dependant renal papillary necrosis), oral lesions if given by mouth, and internal [[hemorrhage]].<ref name="MacKay"/> This is especially pronounced in young, ill, or stressed horses which are less able to metabolize the drug.<ref>Lees P, Higgins AJ. Clinical pharmacology in therapeutic uses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the horse. Equine Vet J 1985;17:83–96.</ref> Effects of GI damage include edema of the legs and belly secondary to leakage of blood proteins into the intestines, resulting in decreased appetite, excessive thirst, weight loss, weakness, and in advanced stages, kidney failure and death.

 


 
Phenylbutazone should not be used in combination with [[vitamin K antagonist]]s such as [[warfarin]] or [[phenprocoumon]], as it amplifies the [[anticoagulant]] effect of these drugs; with other NSAIDs; or in horses with known kidney or liver problems. Phenylbutazone displaces warfarin from plasma binding sites and toxic blood levels leading to haemorrhage can occur.

 


 
Periodic blood tests are recommended when using phenylbutazone, as [[agranulocytosis]] can occur.

 


 
Phenylbutazone should be used cautiously in [[pregnant]] or [[nursing]] [[Mare (horse)|mares]], as it  may be [[toxic]] to the [[embryo]] and can be transferred via the [[umbilical cord]] and by [[milk]].

 


 
Phenylbutazone may be used in foals, but it should be used with particular caution. Premature foals, septicemic foals, foals with questionable kidney or liver function and foals with diarrhea require careful monitoring. Drugs to protect the GI tract such as omeprazole, cimetidine, and sucralfate are frequently used with phenylbutazone.

 


 
High doses of phenylbutazone may be considered a rules violation under some [[equestrianism|equestrian]] organizations, as the drug may remain in the [[bloodstream]] four to five days after administration.

 


 
The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] places it in Group 3; i.e., "not classifiable as to its [[carcinogen]]icity to humans".

 


 
Use in horses is limited to those not intended for food. Metabolites of phenylbutazone can cause [[aplastic anaemia]] in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Irish Veterinary Journal|volume=63|issue=12|title=Phenylbutazone and its availability in ireland – prudent prescribing and dispensing|author=Peadar Ó Scanaill|pages=766–8|url=http://www.veterinaryirelandjournal.com/Links/PDFs/CE-Large/CELA_Dec_2010.pdf.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/meavia/man/ch17/annexee.shtml|title=Ante and Post-mortem Procedures, Dispositions, Monitoring and Controls - Red Meat Species, Ostriches, Rheas and Emus|publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency}}</ref>
