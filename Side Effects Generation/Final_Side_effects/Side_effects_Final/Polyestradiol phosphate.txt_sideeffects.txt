These include nausea, headache, sodium and [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]], gain (but sometimes loss) of body weight, [[impaired glucose tolerance]], and [[mood swing]]s (in 40% of patients). [[Allergic reaction]]s of the skin include itching, [[erythema multiforme]] and, rarely, [[Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> As thromboembolic complications are associated mainly with [[Oral administration|oral]] estrogens and attributed to the [[first-pass effect]], they are expected to occur less frequently under [[parenteral]] therapies such as PEP.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />
