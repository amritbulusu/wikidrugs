Trimetaphan is a [[sulfonium]] compound and therefore carries a positive charge.  Being charged, it cannot cross [[lipid]] [[cell membrane]]s, such as those that comprise the [[bloodâ€“brain barrier]].  Due to this, trimethaphan does not have any effect on the [[central nervous system]].

 


 
The [[ciliary muscle]] of the [[human eye|eye]] functions to round the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] for [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] and is controlled mainly by parasympathetic system input.  With administration of a ganglion-blocking drug, the ciliary muscle cannot contract ([[cycloplegia]]) and the patient loses the ability to focus their eyes.

 


 
Trimetaphan has a strong effect on the [[cardiovascular system]].  The size of blood vessels is primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.  Loss of sympathetic system input to the [[blood vessel]]s causes them to get larger ([[vasodilation]]) which has the effect of lowering [[blood pressure]].  [[Postural hypotension]] is a common side effect of such drugs. Trimethaphan causes a histamine release which further lowers blood pressure. Effects on the [[heart]] include a decreased force of contraction and an increase in heart rate ([[tachycardia]]). Reflexive tachycardia can be diminished or undetected because trimetaphan is also blocking the sympathetic ganglia innervating the heart. 

 


 
The motility of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] is regulated by the parasympathetic system, and blockage of this input results in diminished motility and [[constipation]].
