Fosinopril is de-esterified by the liver or gastrointestinal mucosa and is converted to its active form, fosinoprilat.<ref name="ref4">Duchin K.L., Waclawski A.P., Tu J.I., Manning J., Frantz M., Willard D.A. (1991). Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Pharmacologic Effects of Fosinopril Sodium, an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor in Healthy Subjects. Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 31(1):58-64.</ref> Fosinoprilat [[Competitive inhibition|competitively binds]] to ACE, preventing ACE from binding to and converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibiting the production of AII lowers [[Total peripheral resistance|peripheral vascular resistance]], decreases afterload, and decreases blood pressure,<ref name="ref2"/> thus helping to alleviate the negative effects of AII on cardiac performance. In heart failure patients, fosinopril increases exercise tolerance and lowers the frequency of events associated with worsening heart failure, such as [[dyspnea]], the need for supplemental [[diuretic]]s, fatigue, and hospitalizations.<ref name="ref5">Erhardt L., MacLean A., Ilgenfritz J., Gelperin K., Blumenthal M.
