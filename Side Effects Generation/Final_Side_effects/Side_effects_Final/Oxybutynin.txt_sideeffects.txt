Common adverse effects that are associated with oxybutynin and other [[anticholinergics]] include: dry mouth, difficulty in [[urination]], constipation, blurred vision, drowsiness, and dizziness.<ref>Mehta D (Ed.) 2006.

These are dose-related and sometimes severe. In one population studied—after six months, more than half of the patients had stopped taking the medication because of side effects{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and calcium defects. An intake of calcium of 800 to 1000&nbsp;mg is suggested.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Dry mouth may be particularly severe; one estimate is that over a quarter of patients who begin oxybutynin treatment may have to stop because of dry mouth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

 
Oxybutynin's tendency to reduce sweating can be dangerous. Reduced sweating increases the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke in apparently safe situations where normal sweating keep others safe and comfortable. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0011534/?report=details#warning</ref> Adverse effects of elevated body temperature are more likely for the elderly and for those with health issues, especially multiple sclerosis. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23599395/?i=4&from=/20671034/related</ref>

 


 
''N''-Desethyloxybutynin is an active metabolite of oxybutynin that is thought responsible for much of the adverse effects associated with the use of oxybutynin.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Allen B.

The long-acting formulations also allow once-daily administration instead of the twice-daily dosage required with the immediate-release form. The transdermal patch, in addition to the benefits of the extended-release oral formulations, bypasses the [[First pass effect|first-pass hepatic effect]] that the oral formulations are subject to.<ref>Oki T, et al.

A large study linked the development of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other forms of dementia in those over 65 to the use of oxybutynin, due to its [[anticholinergic]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gray|first=Shelly L.|last2=Anderson|first2=Melissa L.|date=January 26, 2015|title=Cumulative Use of Strong Anticholinergics and Incident Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2091745|journal=JAMA Intern.
