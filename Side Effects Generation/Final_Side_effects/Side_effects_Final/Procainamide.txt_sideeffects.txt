There are many side effects following the induction of procainamide. These adverse effects are [[ventricular dysrhythmia]], [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. The adverse effects occur even more often if the daily doses are increased. Procainamide may also lead to [[drug fever]] and other [[allergic response]]s. There is also a chance that [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] occurs, which at the same time leads to [[polyarthralgia]], [[myalgia]] and [[pleurisy]]. Most of these side effects may occur due to the [[acetylation]] of procainamide.<ref name="adverse">{{cite journal |last1=Lawson |first1=DH |last2=Jick |first2=H |title= Adverse reactions to procainamide |journal= British journal of clinical pharmacology |date= October 1977 |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=507-11 |pmid= 911600 |pmc= 1429167}}</ref>
