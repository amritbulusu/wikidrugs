The most common adverse effects are dizziness, drowsiness, light-headedness, and [[ataxia]]. Flurazepam has abuse potential and should never be used with [[alcoholic beverage]]s or any other substance that can cause drowsiness.  Addictive and possibly fatal results may occur. Flurazepam users should only take this drug strictly as prescribed, and should only be taken directly before the user plans on sleeping a full night. Next day drowsiness is common and may increase during the initial phase of treatment as accumulation occurs until steady-state plasma levels are attained.
