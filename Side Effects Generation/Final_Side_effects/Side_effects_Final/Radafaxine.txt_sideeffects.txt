In various [[clinical trials]], radafaxine has been studied as a treatment for [[clinical depression]], [[obesity]], and [[neuropathy|neuropathic pain]].  Radafaxine is described as a [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (NDRI).

 


 
Unlike [[bupropion]] (which has a much higher effect on [[dopamine]] [[reuptake]]), radafaxine seems to have a higher potency on [[norepinephrine]]. Radafaxine has about 70% of bupropion's efficacy in blocking dopamine reuptake, and 392% of efficacy in blocking norepinephrine reuptake, making it fairly selective for inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine over dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = H | last2 = Loboz | first2 = KK | last3 = Gross | first3 = AS | last4 = McLachlan | first4 = AJ |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2007 | title = Stereoselective analysis of hydroxybupropion and application to drug interaction studies | url = | journal = Chirality | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 163–70 | doi = 10.1002/chir.20356 | pmid = 17167747 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bondarev | first1 = ML | last2 = Bondareva | first2 = TS | last3 = Young | first3 = R | last4 = Glennon | first4 = RA |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2003 | title = Behavioral and biochemical investigations of bupropion metabolites | url = | journal = Eur J Pharmacol | volume = 474 | issue = 1| pages = 85–93 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(03)02010-7 | pmid = 12909199 }}</ref> This, according to GlaxoSmithKline, may account for the increased effect of radafaxine on [[pain]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref>[http://213.219.8.102/pdfs/gsk/cns_seminar/353162.pdf Microsoft PowerPoint - slides_05_burch.ppt<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

 


 
At least one study suggests that radafaxine has a low [[Drug abuse|abuse]] potential similar to bupropion.<ref>[http://www.biopsychiatry.com/radafaxine.htm Radafaxine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
