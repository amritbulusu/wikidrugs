The most common adverse reactions encountered in Phase II and Phase III trials were nausea (5.5%), headache (4.7%), and diarrhea (4.4%), as well as rash (2.7%) and itchiness (2.1%).  Other less frequent but serious adverse reactions included hematologic disorders, hepatotoxicity, ''Clostridium difficile'' colitis, bronchospasm, infusion-related reactions including [[Red man syndrome (Drug eruption)|Red Man Syndrome]], and anaphylactic shock.<ref name="pi" />  In trials, dalbavancin was associated with higher rates of hemorrhagic events compared to comparator groups and should be a precaution in patients undergoing surgery or taking anticoagulants.<ref name="nih" />  Patients on dalbavancin also had post-baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels that were 3 times the upper normal limit, some even having elevations 10 times the upper normal limit; however, eight of the twelve dalbavancin-treated patients had comorbid conditions that could affect their ALT, compared to only one patient in the comparator group.<ref name="pi" />  There is no evidence of ototoxicity associated with dalbavancin.<ref name="fda" />
