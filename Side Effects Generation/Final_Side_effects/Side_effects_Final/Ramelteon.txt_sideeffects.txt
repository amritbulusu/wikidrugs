Ramelteon has not been shown to produce dependence and has shown no potential for abuse, and the withdrawal and [[rebound insomnia]] that is typical with [[GABA]] modulators is not present in ramelteon.

 


 
Six percent of ramelteon-treated patients in clinical trials discontinued due to an adverse event, compared to 2% in the placebo arms. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation were somnolence, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, headache, and insomnia.  The United States official Prescribing Information warns of rare cases of anaphylactic reactions, abnormal thinking, and suicide in patients with pre-existing depression.

 


 
In mice treated with ramelteon for two years, increases in liver and testicular tumors were observed, but only at doses at least 20 times greater than the recommended human dose on a milligram/kilogram basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/021782s011lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>
