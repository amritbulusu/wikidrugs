Acute pancreatitis can lead to serious injury and even death. Pancreatitis, especially if it reoccurs, can lead to pancreatic cancer, which is almost always fatal.

 


 
Additionally, it is expected that new warnings related to sleep paralysis will also added to the Viibryd label and prescribing information. Sleep paralysis is a condition in which a person is awake but cannot move or speak. Generally, sleep paralysis occurs upon waking and lasts less than one minute. Although sleep paralysis is a serious condition, and can cause psychological harm in the most severe cases, the condition is generally not life threatening.

 


 
After a one-year, open-label study assessing the safety and tolerability of vilazodone in people with major depressive disorder, the most common adverse effects were [[diarrhea]] (35.7%), [[nausea]] (31.6%), and [[headache]] (20.0%); greater than 90% of these adverse effects were mild or moderate.<ref name = intj/> Whereas in randomized controlled trials these rates were 28%, 23.4% and 13.3%, respectively.<ref name = intj/> In contrast to other [[SSRI]]s currently on the market, initial clinical trials showed that vilazodone did not cause significant [[Antidepressant#Sexual|decreased sexual desire/function]] as with many other antidepressants, which often cause people to abandon their use.<ref name="approval" />

;Rare adverse effects (<0.1% incidence):

 
* [[Serotonin syndrome]]—a serious adverse effect characterised by:

 
**Nausea

 
**Vomiting

 
**Mental status change (e.g. confusion, hallucinations, agitation, coma, stupor)

 
**Muscle rigidity

 
**Tremor

 
**[[Myoclonus]]

 
**[[Hyperreflexia]]—overresponsive/overactive reflexes

 
**Hyperthermia—elevated body temperature

 
**Autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, dizziness, abnormally excessive sweating, etc.)

 
* [[Mania]]/[[hypomania]]—a potentially dangerously elated/agitated mood. Every antidepressant has the potential to induce these psychiatric reactions. They are particularly problematic in those with a history of hypomania/mania such as those with [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name = "AMH">Australian Medicines Handbook 2013.

;Unknown-incidence adverse effects:

 
* Suicidal ideation—all antidepressants can cause suicidal ideation especially in young adults and adolescents under the age of 25.

 
* Abnormal bleeding—the SSRIs are known for their ability to increase the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeds and other bleeding abnormalities.<ref name = "AMH" /><ref name = "Maudsley">Taylor D, Paton C, Kapur S, Taylor D.

* Seizures

 
* [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion]] (SIADH)—a condition characterised by an abnormally excessive secretion of [[antidiuretic hormone]] causing potentially-fatal electrolyte abnormalities (such as hyponatraemia). 

 
* [[Hyponatraemia]] (a complication of the former)—low blood sodium.
