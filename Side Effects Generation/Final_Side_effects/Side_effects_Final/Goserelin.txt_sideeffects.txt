This is known as the tumour flare effect, and is the result of an initial increase in [[luteinizing hormone]] production, before the receptors are desensitised and hormonal production is inhibited. The symptoms will disappear, with hormonal inhibition.  It is therefore advisable to co-treat with an [[antiandrogen]] during the first 2–3 weeks of goserelin treatment, particularly in patients with pre-existing bone symptoms. 

 


 
Goserelin may cause [[bone pain]], [[hot flushes]], [[headache]], [[Abdominal pain|stomach upset]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Urinary retention|difficulty urinating]] (isolated cases), [[weight gain]], [[Mastodynia|swelling and tenderness of breasts]] (infrequent), [[Erectile dysfunction|decreased erections]] and [[Libido#Libido_impairment|reduced sexual desire]]. Bone pain can be managed symptomatically, and erectile dysfunction can be treated by [[Levitra]] ([[Vardenafil]]) or other similar oral therapies, although they will not treat the reduced sexual desire.
