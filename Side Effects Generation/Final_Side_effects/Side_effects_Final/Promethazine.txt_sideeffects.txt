Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly.<ref>NCQAâ€™s HEDIS Measure: [http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf Use of High Risk Medications in the Elderly]</ref>  In many countries (including the US and UK), promethazine is contraindicated in children less than two years of age, and strongly cautioned against in children between two and six, due to problems with respiratory depression and sleep apnea.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Starke P, Weaver J, Chowdhury B | year = 2005 | title = Boxed warning added to promethazine labeling for pediatric use | url = | journal = N.
