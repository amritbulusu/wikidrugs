Results of a medical study known as the [[Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial|Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST)]] demonstrated that patients with structural heart disease (such as a history of MI (heart attack), or left ventricular dysfunction) and also patients with ventricular arrhythmias, should not take this drug. The results were so significant that the trial was stopped early and preliminary results were published.<ref name = CAST>{{cite journal | author = Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) Investigators | title = Preliminary report: effect of encainide and flecainide on mortality in a randomized trial of arrhythmia suppression after myocardial infarction. | journal = N Engl J Med.  | volume = 321 | issue =  6| pages = 406–412 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2473403| doi =10.1056/NEJM198908103210629  }}</ref>

 


 
The dose may need to be adjusted in certain clinical scenarios.  As with all other [[antiarrhythmic agent]]s, there is a risk of [[proarrhythmia]] associated with the use of flecainide.  This risk is probably increased when flecainide is co-administered with other class Ic antiarrhythmics, such as [[encainide]].  The risk of proarrhythmia may also be increased by [[hypokalemia]].<ref name = Ohki>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ohki R, Takahashi M, Mizuno O, Fujikawa H, Mitsuhashi T, Katsuki T, Ikeda U, Shimada K | title = Torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia induced by mosapride and flecainide in the presence of hypokalemia | journal = Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–21 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11227957 | doi = 10.1046/j.1460-9592.2001.00119.x}}</ref>  The risk of proarrhythmia is not necessarily associated with the length of time an individual is taking flecainide, and cases of late proarrhythmia have been reported.<ref name = Morganroth>{{cite journal | author = Morganroth J | title = Early and late proarrhythmia from antiarrhythmic drug therapy | journal = Cardiovasc Drugs Ther | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–4 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1533532 | doi = 10.1007/BF00050910}}</ref>  Because of the role of both the liver and the kidneys in the elimination of flecainide, the dosing of flecainide may need to be adjusted in individuals who develop either liver failure or renal failure.

 


 
Because of the negative inotropic effects of flecainide, it should be used with caution in individuals with depressed [[ejection fraction]], and may worsen [[congestive heart failure]] in these individuals. It should be avoided in people with ischaemic heart disease and the elderly.<ref name = Santinelli/>

 


 
As with all class I [[antiarrhythmic agents]], Flecainide increases the capture thresholds of [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].<ref name = Fornieles-Pérez>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fornieles-Pérez H, Montoya-García M, Levine P, Sanz O | title = Documentation of acute rise in ventricular capture thresholds associated with flecainide acetate | journal = Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 871–2 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12049386 | doi = 10.1046/j.1460-9592.2002.00871.x}}</ref>
