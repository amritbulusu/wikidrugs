Adalimumab is a [[TNF inhibitor|TNF-inhibiting]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[Biopharmaceutical|biologic medication]]. It binds to [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNFα), which normally binds to TNFα receptors, leading to the inflammatory response of [[autoimmune disease]]s. By binding to TNFα, adalimumab reduces this inflammatory response. Because TNFα is also part of the [[immune system]], which protects the body from infection, treatment with adalimumab may increase the risk of infections.
