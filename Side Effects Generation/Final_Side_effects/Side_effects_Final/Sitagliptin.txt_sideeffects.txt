The existence of rare case reports of renal failure and hypersensitivity reactions is noted in the United States prescribing information, but a causative role for sitagliptin has not been established.<ref name=PrescribeInfo>{{cite web |url=https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/j/januvia/januvia_pi.pdf |title=www.merck.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

 


 
Several [[postmarketing surveillance|postmarketing reports]] of [[pancreatitis]] (some fatal) have been made in people treated with sitagliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olansky L |title=Do incretin-based therapies cause acute pancreatitis? |journal=J Diabetes Sci Technol |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=228–9 |year=2010 |pmid=20167189 |pmc=2825646 |doi=10.1177/193229681000400129}}</ref> and the U.S. package insert carries a warning to this effect,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.januvia.com/sitagliptin/januvia/consumer/type-2-diabetes-medicine/index.jsp?WT.svl=2?src=1&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=JA80G |title=Januvia for type 2 diabetes |publisher=Merck & Co. |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> although the causal link between sitagliptin and pancreatitis has not yet been fully substantiated.<ref name=medupdate01 />  One study with lab rats published in 2009 concluded that some of the possible risks of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer may be reduced when it is used with metformin. However, while DPP-4 inhibitors showed an increase in such risk factors, as of 2009, no increase in pancreatic cancer has been reported in individuals taking DPP-4 inhibitors.<ref>Aleksey V.

The updated (August 2015) prescribing information cautions that multiple [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarketing reports]] have been made of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving sitagliptin. Merck notes:

 


 
{{quote|Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 


 
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and nonfatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis); severe and disabling arthralgia; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; pemphigoid.<ref name=PrescribeInfo/>}}

 


 
In 2015, FDA added a new Warning and Precaution about the risk of "severe and disabling" joint pain to the labels of all DPP-4 Inhibitor medicines.<ref>{{cite web|title=DPP-4 Inhibitors for Type 2 Diabetes: Drug Safety Communication—May Cause Severe Joint Pain|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm460238.htm|website=FDA|accessdate=1 September 2015|date=2015-08-28}}</ref> In addition to sitagliptin, other DPP-4 inhibitors such as saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin must also carry the new FDA Warning and Precaution label.
