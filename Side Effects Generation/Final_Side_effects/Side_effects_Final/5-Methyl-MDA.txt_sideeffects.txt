[[Classical conditioning|Drug discrimination]] studies showed that 5-methyl-MDA substitutes for MDA, [[5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-aminoindane|MMAI]], and [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], but not [[amphetamine]], suggesting that it produces a mix of entactogen and hallucinogenic effects without any [[stimulant]] effects.<ref name="urlSynthesis of 5-Methyl-MDA - [www.rhodium.ws]">{{cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/5-methyl-mda.html | title = Synthesis of 5-Methyl-MDA - [www.rhodium.ws] | date = | work = | publisher = | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = }}</ref>

 


 
5-Methyl-MDA acts as a [[selective serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA) with [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 107nM, 11,600nM, and 1,494nM for [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]] efflux.<ref name="pmid9526575" /> It is over 5x more potent than MDA, with a suitable active dose possibly being around 15–25&nbsp;mg.<ref name="pmid9526575" /><ref name="urlSynthesis of 5-Methyl-MDA - [www.rhodium.ws]" /> Subsequent testing, however, has found that it is not as potent as once thought and is active at at least 100mg. [[2-Methyl-MDA]] is also much more potent than MDA, but is not quite as potent as 5-methyl-MDA.<ref name="pmid9526575" /> [[Madam-6|6-methyl-MDMA]] (also known as Madam-6) is mostly inactive, likely due to [[steric hindrance]].<ref name="pmid9526575" /><ref>[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal098.shtml PIHKAL #98]</ref>

 


 
Recent research has used data on 2-methyl-MDA and 5-methyl-MDA to help guide computer modeling of the [[serotonin transporter]] complex.<ref name="pmid18354055">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walline CC, Nichols DE, Carroll FI, Barker EL | title = Comparative molecular field analysis using selectivity fields reveals residues in the third transmembrane helix of the serotonin transporter associated with substrate and antagonist recognition | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 325 | issue = 3 | pages = 791–800 |date=June 2008 | pmid = 18354055 | pmc = 2637348 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.108.136200 | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18354055 | issn = }}</ref>
