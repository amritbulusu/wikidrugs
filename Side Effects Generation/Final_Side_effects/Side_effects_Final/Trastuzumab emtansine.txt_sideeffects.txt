During clinical trials, the most common [[adverse effect]]s of trastuzumab emtansine were fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, [[thrombocytopenia]] (low [[platelet]] counts), headache, [[elevated transaminases|increased liver enzyme levels]], and constipation.<ref name="PI"/>

 


 
Severe adverse events identified during the EMILIA trial included [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage), including rare cases of [[liver failure]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]], and [[nodular regenerative hyperplasia]]; heart damage (dysfunction of the [[left ventricle]]); [[interstitial lung disease]], including [[acute interstitial pneumonitis]]; thrombocytopenia; and [[peripheral neuropathy]].<ref name="PI"/> Overall, trastuzumab emtansine was better tolerated than the control treatment, a combination of [[lapatinib]] (Tykerb) and [[capecitabine]] (Xeloda), with 43% of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group experiencing severe toxic effects, versus 59% of those who received lapatinib/capecitabine; furthermore, fewer patients had to stop treatment due to adverse effects than with lapatinib or capecitabine.<ref name="PI"/> [[Anemia]], low platelet counts, and peripheral neuropathy were more common among patients who received trastuzumab emtansine, whereas heart damage and gastrointestinal effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and [[stomatitis]], were more common with lapatinib/capecitabine.<ref name="PI"/>

 


 
In the United States, Kadcyla carries [[black box warning]]s for liver toxicity, heart damage (reduction in left ventricular [[ejection fraction]]), and [[developmental toxicity|fetal harm]] if given to pregnant women.<ref name="PI"/>
