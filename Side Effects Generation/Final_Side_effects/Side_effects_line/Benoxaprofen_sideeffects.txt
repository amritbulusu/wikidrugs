'''Benoxaprofen''', also known as Benoxaphen, is a chemical compound with the formula C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>12</sub>ClNO<sub>3</sub>. It is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) and was marketed under the brand name '''Oraflex''' in the United States and as '''Opren''' in Europe by [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. Lilly suspended sales of Oraflex in 1982 after reports from the British government and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) of adverse effects and deaths linked to the drug.

 
Benoxaprofen was discovered by a team of Lilly chemists at its British laboratory. This laboratory was assigned to explore new anti-arthritic compounds in 1966. Lilly applied for patents on benoxaprofen seven years later and also filed for permission from the FDA to start testing the drug on humans. It had to undergo the three-step clinical testing procedure required by the Federal Government.<ref name="At Lilly">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9804E7D91E39F936A2575BC0A964948260 New York Times – At Lilly, the Side-Effects Of Oraflex]</ref>

 
On the fourth of August 1982 the British government temporarily suspended sales of the drug in UK ‘on grounds of safety’. The British Committee on the Safety of Medicines declared, in a telegram to the FDA, that it had received reports of more than 3,500 adverse side-effects among patients who had used Oraflex. There were also 61 deaths, most of which were of elderly people. Almost simultaneously, the FDA said it had reports of 11 deaths in the USA among Oraflex users, most of which were caused by kidney and liver damage.<ref name="At Lilly" />

 
== Efficacy and side effects ==

 
Benoxaprofen is an [[analgesic]], [[antipyretic]] and anti-inflammatory drug.<ref>Dahl, S.L.; Ward, J.R.: Pharmacology, clinical efficiency, and adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent benoxaprofen. Abstract</ref>

 
=== Adverse effects ===

 
There are different types of side effects. Most of them were cutaneous or gastrointestinal. Side effects appear rarely in the central nervous system and miscellaneous side effects were not often observed.  A study shows that most side effects appear in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<ref name="Halsey" />

 
==== Cutaneous side effects ====

 
Cutaneous side effects of benoxaprofen are [[photosensitivity]], [[onycholysis]], [[rash]], [[milium (disease)|milia]], increased nail growth, [[pruritus]] (itch) and [[hypertrichosis]].<ref name="Halsey" /> Photosensitivity leads to burning, itching or redness when patients are exposed to sunlight.<ref>Hindson, C.; Daymond, T.; Diffey, B.; Lawlor, F.: Side effects of benaxoprofen; Britisch Medical Journal, Vol 284, pp. 1368–1369 (8 May 1982)</ref>

 
==== Gastrointestinal side effects ====

 
Gastrointestinal side effects of benoxaprofen are bleeding, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, [[anorexia (symptom)]], [[mouth ulcers]] and taste change.<ref name="Halsey" /><ref>Somerville, K.W.; Hawkey, C.J.: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and the gastrointestinal tract; Postgraduate Medical Journal (1986), Vol 62, pp. 23-28</ref> According to a study the most appearing gastric side effects are vomiting, heartburn and epigastric pain.<ref name="Halsey" />

 
==== Side effects in the central nervous system ====

 
==== Miscellaneous side effects ====

 
After the suspension of sales in 1982 the toxic effects which benoxaprofen might have on humans were looked into more deeply. The fairly planar compound of benoxaprofen seems to be hepa- and phototoxic in the human body.<ref name="Lewis" />

 
== Effects on animals ==

 
The effects of Benoxaprofen on animals were tested in a series of experiments.<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" /><ref name="Knights">Knights, K.M. Cassidy, M.R. Drew, R. (1986). Benoxaprofen induced toxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes. Toxicology, Vol.40, p.327-339</ref> Benoxaprofen had a considerably anti-inflammatory, analgesic and also anti-pyretic activity in those tests.<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" /> In all six animals tested, which included rats, dogs, rhesus monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice, the drug was well absorbed orally. In three of the six species benoxaprofen was then effectively taken up from the gastrointestinal tract (after oral doses of 1–10&nbsp;mg/kg).<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" /> The plasma half life was found to be different, being less than 13 hours in the dog, rabbit and monkey, it was notable longer in mice. Furthermore, there were species differences found in the rate and route of excretion of the compound. Whereas benoxaprofen was excreted into the urine by the rabbit and guinea pig, biliary excretion was the way of clearance found in rats and dogs. In all species only unchanged benoxaprofen was found in the plasma mostly extensively bound to proteins.<ref name="Chatfield Disposition" />
