Etorphine is available legally only for [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] use and is strictly governed by law. It is often used to immobilize [[elephant]]s and other large mammals. [[Diprenorphine]] (M5050), also known as Revivon, is an opioid receptor antagonist that can be administered in proportion to the amount of etorphine used (1.3 times) to reverse its effects. Veterinary-strength etorphine is fatal to humans. For this reason the package as supplied to vets always includes the human antidote as well as etorphine.

 
One of its main advantages is its speed of operation and, more importantly, the speed with which [[diprenorphine]] reverses the effects. The high incidence of side-effects, including severe cardiopulmonary depression,  has caused etorphine to fall into disfavor in general veterinary practice.  However, its high potency combined with the rapid action of both etorphine and its antagonist, diprenorphine,  means that it has found a place for capture of large mammals such as rhinoceroses and elephants; under these circumstances both rapid onset and rapid recovery are very important characteristics. The high potency of etorphine means that sufficient etorphine can be administered to large wild mammals by projectile syringe (dart).
