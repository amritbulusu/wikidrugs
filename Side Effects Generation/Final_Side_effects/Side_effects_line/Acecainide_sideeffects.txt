Acecainide is [[pharmacologically]] active as an [[antiarrhythmic agent]]. It has electrophysiological effects of a class III antiarrhytmic drug and it is used as a medicine to increase the Q – T interval of the PQRST heart rhythm in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. The equivalent drug procainamide, which is a class Ia antiarrhytmic drug, is also used in patients with cardiac arrhythmias.<ref name="Schoenwald, Ronald D. - 2010"/> Nevertheless, NAPA does only affect the Q - T interval, while procainamide has also effect on the QRS-interval.<ref name="Funck">{{cite journal |author=Funck-Brentano C | title=Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction of N-acetyl procainamide and procainamide in humans. | journal=J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. | year=1989 | volume=14 | issue=3 | pages=364–73 | pmid=2476614 | doi=10.1097/00005344-198909000-00003}}</ref> Also the electrophysiologic properties of NAPA are a little bit different from those of procainamide and NAPA is not completely effective for suppressing ventricular dysrhythmias, but its antiarrhythmic mechanisms are similar to those of procainamide.<ref name="Sung-1983">{{Cite journal

 
The dose of acecainide should be adjusted to control the patients’ arrhythmias and with regard to their clinical state including age, renal function and concurrent administration of other drugs. There appears to be an overlap in plasma concentrations required for therapeutic efficacy and those associated with adverse effects. Rapid bolus infusion of acecainide has been associated with serious hypotension and a maximum infusion rate of 50&nbsp;mg/min has been suggested.<ref name="Harron-1990"/>

 
Intravenous infusion of 0.45&nbsp;mg/kg/min for 30 minutes, followed by 0.22&nbsp;mg/ml/min for 30 minutes and a maintenance infusion, suppressed more than 90% of PVCs. Doses of acecainide 15 to 20&nbsp;mg/kg were also effective in preventing induced ventricular tachycardia or prolonging ventricular tachycardia cycle length and reducing frequency of PVCs. However, the dosage required to maintain antiarrhythmic effects is still not clear.<ref name="Harron-1990"/>

 
===Effects on humans===

 
acecainide can cause cardiac toxicity that effects in [[torsades de pointes]]. Also acecainide can decrease renal function when it is accumulated during a procainamide therapy. Furthermore, acecainide can lead to a low blood pressure and a serious left ventricle depression when it is present in toxic concentrations.<ref name="Descotes-1996"/>  Other common side effects of NAPA are gastrointestinal disturbances, insomnia, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, numbness and tingling sensation.<ref name="Manuchair Ebad- 1997"/><ref name="Atkinson-1977">{{Cite journal

 
}}</ref> There has been a large resemblance reported between the concentration range associated with arrhythmic suppression of acecainide and the range of concentrations where intolerable side effects begin to develop. No severe cardiac toxicity has been notified with oral intake despite plasma concentrations as high as 40 micrograms/ml. However, hypotension has been reported in association with a rapid injection of acecainide.<ref name="Kates-1982"/>

 
===Effects on animals===

 
In animals, acecainide has positive inotropic effects, but it also causes negative chronotropic and hypotensive activity.<ref name="Descotes-1996"/> The cardiovascular pharmacodynamics of procainamide and NAPA have not been well identified in small rodents without the presence of anesthesia or restraint. Researchers are trying to make models of the effects of procainamide and acecainide in animals.<ref name="Karidia-1996">{{Cite journal
