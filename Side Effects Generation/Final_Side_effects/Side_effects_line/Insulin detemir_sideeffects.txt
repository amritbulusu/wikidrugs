<blockquote>"LEVEMIR was associated with somewhat less weight gain than NPH (Table 4). Whether these observed differences represent true differences in the effects of LEVEMIR and NPH insulin is not known, since these trials were not blinded and the protocols (e.g., diet and exercise instructions and monitoring) were not specifically directed at exploring hypotheses related to weight effects of the treatments compared. The clinical significance of the observed differences has not been established..."[http://www.novo-pi.com/levemir.pdf Levemir Package Insert; Adverse Reactions > Weight Gain]</blockquote>
