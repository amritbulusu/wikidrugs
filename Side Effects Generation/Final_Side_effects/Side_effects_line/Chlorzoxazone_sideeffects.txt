'''Chlorzoxazone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a centrally acting [[muscle relaxant]] used to treat muscle [[spasm]] and the resulting pain or discomfort.  It acts on the spinal cord by depressing reflexes.  It is sold under the trade names "'Lorzone'", '''Paraflex''' and '''Muscol''' and in combination form as '''Parafon Forte''', a combination of chlorzoxazone and [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol).  Possible side effects include [[dizziness]], [[lightheadedness]], [[malaise]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and liver dysfunction. Used with acetaminophen it has added risk of [[hepatoxicity]],{{medcn|date=December 2013}} which is why the combination is not recommended. It can also be administered for acute pain in general and for tension headache (muscle contraction headache).
