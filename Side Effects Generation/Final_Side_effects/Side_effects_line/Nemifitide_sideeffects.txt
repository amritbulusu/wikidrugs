The [[mechanism of action]] of nemifitide is unclear, but since MIF-1 has been demonstrated to have similar antidepressant effects<ref name="pmid6138756">{{cite journal |pmid=6138756 |year=1983 |last1=Van Der Velde |first1=CD |title=Rapid clinical effectiveness of MIF-I in the treatment of major depressive illness |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=297–300 |journal=Peptides |doi=10.1016/0196-9781(83)90136-5}}</ref> it may act in an analogous manner.<ref name="FoyeLemke2007"/><ref name="pmid18980729" /> Possibly of interest however is that nemifitide binds to several [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s including [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] (where it has been shown to act as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]), [[Neuropeptide Y receptor|NPY<sub>1</sub>]], [[Bombesin receptor|bombesin]], and [[Melanocortin 4 receptor|MC<sub>4</sub>]] and [[Melanocortin 5 receptor|MC<sub>5</sub>]], though at only [[molar concentration|micromolar concentration]]s.<ref name="Alarcón2004"/> Whether any of these relatively weak actions are of any clinical significance is unclear.
