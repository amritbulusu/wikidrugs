===Reducing toxic effects of alcohol===

 
Cysteine has been proposed as a preventative or antidote for some of the negative effects of alcohol, including liver damage and [[hangover]]. It counteracts the poisonous effects of [[acetaldehyde]]. Cysteine supports the next step in metabolism, which turns acetaldehyde into the relatively harmless [[acetic acid]].  In a [[rat]] study, test animals received an {{LD50}} dose of acetaldehyde. Those that received cysteine had an 80% survival rate; when both cysteine and [[thiamine]] were administered, all animals survived.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sprince H, Parker CM, Smith GG, Gonzales LJ |title=Protection against acetaldehyde toxicity in the rat by L-cysteine, thiamin and L-2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid |journal=Agents Actions |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=125â€“30 |date=April 1974 |pmid=4842541 |doi=10.1007/BF01966822}}</ref> No direct evidence indicates its effectiveness in humans who consume alcohol at low levels.
