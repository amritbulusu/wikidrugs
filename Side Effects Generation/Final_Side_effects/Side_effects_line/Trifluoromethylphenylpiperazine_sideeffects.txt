== Use and effects ==

 
TFMPP is rarely used by itself. In fact, TFMPP reduces locomotor activity and produces aversive effects in animals rather than self-administration, which may explain the decision of the DEA not to permanently make TFMPP a controlled substance.<ref name="pmid15496938"/> More commonly, TFMPP is co-administered with BZP, which acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Partilla JS, Dempsey AG, Nagpal AS, Blough BE, Baumann MH, Rothman RB |title=Interaction of amphetamines and related compounds at the vesicular monoamine transporter |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |date=October 2006 |volume=319 |issue=1 |pages=237–46 |doi=10.1124/jpet.106.103622 |pmid=16835371}}</ref> Due to the serotonin agonist effects and increase in serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels produced by the BZP/TFMPP combination, this mixture of drugs produces effects which crudely mimic those of [[MDMA]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yarosh HL, Katz EB, Coop A, Fantegrossi WE |title=MDMA-like behavioral effects of N-substituted piperazines in the mouse |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior |date=November 2007 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=18–27 |doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2007.06.007}}</ref>

 
== Side effects ==

 
The combination of BZP and TFMPP has been associated with a range of side effects, including [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], [[nausea]] and vomiting, [[headaches]] and muscle aches which may resemble [[migraine]], [[seizures]], [[impotence]], and rarely [[psychosis]],<ref name="Schep2011"/> as well as a prolonged and unpleasant [[hangover]] effect. These side effects tend to be significantly worsened when the BZP/TFMPP mix is consumed alongside [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], especially the headache, nausea, and hangover.

 
However, it is difficult to say how many of these side effects are produced by TFMPP itself, as it has rarely been marketed without BZP also being present, and all of the side effects mentioned are also produced by BZP (which has been sold as a single drug). Studies into other related piperazine drugs such as [[1-(3-Chlorophenyl)piperazine|mCPP]] suggest that certain side effects such as [[anxiety]], [[headache]] and [[nausea]] are common to all drugs of this class, and pills containing TFMPP are reported by users to produce comparatively more severe hangover effects than those containing only BZP. The drug can also cause the body to tremble for a long period of time.<ref>{{cite web |vauthors=Wilkins C, Girling M, Sweetsur P, Huckle T, Huakau J | title =Legal party pill use in New Zealand: Prevalence of use, availability, health harms and ‘gateway effects’ of benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluorophenylmethylpiperazine (TFMPP) | publisher = Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation (SHORE)  | url =http://www.spiritualhigh.co.uk/spiritualhigh.co.uk/downloads/Legal-party-pills-in-New-Zealand-report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-04-14}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}}
