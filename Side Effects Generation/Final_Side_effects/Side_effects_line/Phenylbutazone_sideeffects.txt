In the United States and United Kingdom it is no longer approved for human use (except for ankylosing spondylitis, because no other treatment is available), as it can cause severe adverse effects such as suppression of [[white blood cell]] production and [[aplastic anemia]]. This drug was implicated in the [[2013 meat adulteration scandal]]. Positive phenylbutazone tests in horse meat were uncommon in the UK, however.<ref name=fsa>{{cite web|title=Horse meat investigation.

Side effects of phenylbutazone in dogs include gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bone marrow depression, rashes, malaise, blood dyscrasias, and diminished renal blood flow.

 
Phenylbutazone has a [[biological half-life|plasma elimination half-life]] of 4-8 hours, however the inflammatory exudate half life is 24 hours,<ref>Lees P, Taylor KBO, Higgins AJ, Sharma SC. Phenylbuta- zone and oxyphenbutazone distribution into tissue fluids in the horse. J Vet Pharmacol Ther 1986;9:204–212.</ref> so single daily dosing can be sufficient, although it is often used twice per day.<ref name=McIlwraith/> The drug is considered fairly non-toxic when given at appropriate doses (2.2-4.4 mg/kg/day), even when used repeatedly.<ref>Collins LG, Tyler DE.

J Am Vet Med Assoc 1984;184: 699 –703.</ref> This dose has been doubled for diseases that cause severe pain, such as [[laminitis]], but is toxic if repeated long-term, and exceptionally high doses (15 mg/kg/d or higher) can kill the animal in less than a week.<ref name="MacKay">MacKay RJ, French TW, Nguyen HT, Mayhew IG.

==Side effects and disadvantages==

 
Side effects of phenylbutazone are similar to those of other NSAIDs. Overdose or prolonged use can cause [[Equine gastric ulcer syndrome|gastrointestinal ulcers]], [[blood dyscrasia]], [[kidney]] damage (primarily dose-dependant renal papillary necrosis), oral lesions if given by mouth, and internal [[hemorrhage]].<ref name="MacKay"/> This is especially pronounced in young, ill, or stressed horses which are less able to metabolize the drug.<ref>Lees P, Higgins AJ. Clinical pharmacology in therapeutic uses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the horse. Equine Vet J 1985;17:83–96.</ref> Effects of GI damage include edema of the legs and belly secondary to leakage of blood proteins into the intestines, resulting in decreased appetite, excessive thirst, weight loss, weakness, and in advanced stages, kidney failure and death.
