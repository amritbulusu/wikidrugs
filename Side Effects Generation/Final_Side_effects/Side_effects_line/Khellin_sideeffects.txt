Therapeutic use is often not recommended, as the risks often outweigh the benefits.  Regardless of this recommendation, Ammi Visnaga is still often used in the Middle East, Egypt, and surrounding areas.  Unwanted side effects include dizziness, reversible [[cholestasis|cholestatic jaundice]], pseudoallergic reaction, and elevated levels of liver enzymes (transaminases and [[gamma-glutamyltransferase]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blumenthal|first1=M|last2=Busse|first2=W.R.|last3=Goldberg|first3=A.|last4=Gruenwald|first4=J.|last5=Hall|first5=T.|last6=Riggins|first6=C.W.|last7=Rister|first7=R.S|title=The complete German commission monographs, therapeutic guide to herbal medicines|date=1998}}</ref>

 
When taken systemically, khellin induces elevated liver enzyme levels and broad photosensitivity; however, topical application reduces these side effects.  [[Psoralens]] are commonly used for vitiligo treatment, but have higher phototoxic and DNA mutagenic effects.  While Khellin treatment in conjunction with UV therapy is successful, accelerated photoaging and increased risk of skin cancer is another concern.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Plettenberg|first1=Heidi|last2=Assmann|first2=Till|last3=Ruzicka|first3=Thomas|title=Childhood vitiligo and tacrolimus|journal=Arch Dermatol.|date=2003|volume=139|pages=651–654|doi=10.1001/archderm.139.5.651}}</ref>

 
Intramuscular injections of khellin can also be used to treat asthma.  Khellin acts as a bronchodilator; however, the common side effects including nausea present difficulties.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=M.C.S|last2=Stock|first2=J.P.P|title=The bronchodilator action of khellin|journal=Thorax|date=1952|volume=7|pages=43–65|doi=10.1136/thx.7.1.43}}</ref>
