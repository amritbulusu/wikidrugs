In animal and human studies, it has shown similar efficacy to [[theophylline]] but with significantly fewer side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sankar J, Lodha R, Kabra SK |title=Doxofylline: The next generation methylxanthine |journal=Indian J Pediatr |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=251–4 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18376093 |doi= 10.1007/s12098-008-0054-1|url=}}</ref>

 
Unlike other xanthines, doxofylline lacks any significant [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for [[adenosine receptor]]s and does not produce [[stimulant]] effects. This suggests that its antiasthmatic effects are mediated by another mechanism, perhaps its actions on [[phosphodiesterase]].<ref name="pmid3245738" />
