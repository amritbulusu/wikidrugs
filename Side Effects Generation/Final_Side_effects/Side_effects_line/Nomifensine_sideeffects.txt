The drug was developed in the 1960s by [[Hoechst AG]] (now [[Sanofi-Aventis]]),<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | status = patent | number = 3577424 | title = 4-Phenyl-8-Amino Tetrahydroisoquinolines | assign1 = Farbwerke Hoechst | gdate = 1971-05-04 }}</ref> who then [[test market]]ed it in the [[United States]]. It was an effective antidepressant, without sedative effects. Nomifensine did not interact significantly with alcohol and lacked anticholinergic effects. No withdrawal symptoms were seen after 6 months treatment. The drug was however considered not suitable for agitated patients as it presumably made agitation worse.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Side effects and withdrawal from market==

 
During treatment with nomifensine there were relatively few adverse effects, mainly [[Kidney failure|renal failure]], paranoid symptoms, [[Somnolence|drowsiness]] or [[insomnia]], [[headache]], and [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]]. Side effects affecting the cardiovascular system included [[tachycardia]] and [[palpitations]], but nomifensine was significantly less cardiotoxic than the standard tricyclic antidepressants.<ref name="pmid911653">{{cite journal |author=Hanks GW |title=A profile of nomifensine |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=4Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=243Sâ€“248S |year=1977 |pmid=911653 |pmc=1429121 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1977.tb05760.x |url= }}</ref>
