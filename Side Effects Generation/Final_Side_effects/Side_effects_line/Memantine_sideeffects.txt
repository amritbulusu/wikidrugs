== Adverse effects ==

 
Memantine is, in general, well-tolerated.<ref name=AMH2006/> Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of people) include confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, agitation, and/or hallucinations. Less common adverse effects include vomiting, anxiety, [[hypertonia]], [[cystitis]], and increased [[libido]].<ref name=AMH2006>Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006.

Like many other [[NMDA antagonists]], memantine behaves as a [[dissociative anesthetic]] at supratherapeutic doses.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris H, Wallach J |title=From PCP to MXE: a comprehensive review of the non-medical use of dissociative drugs |journal=Drug Testing and Analysis |volume=6 |issue=7–8 |pages=614–32 |year=2014 |pmid=24678061 |doi=10.1002/dta.1620 }}</ref>  Despite isolated reports, recreational use of memantine is rare due to the drug's long duration and limited availability.<ref name="Morris"/> Also memantine seems to lack most of the psychoactive effects recreational users are looking for, like euphoria, hallucinations etc.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Swedberg MD, Ellgren M, Raboisson P |title=mGluR5 antagonist-induced psychoactive properties: MTEP drug discrimination, a pharmacologically selective non-NMDA effect with apparent lack of reinforcing properties |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=349 |issue=1 |pages=155–64 |year=2014 |pmid=24472725 |doi=10.1124/jpet.113.211185 }}</ref>

 
Memantine acts as a non-competitive antagonist at different neuronal [[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)]] at potencies possibly similar to the NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors, but this is difficult to ascertain with accuracy because of the rapid desensitization of nAChR responses in these experiments. It can be noted that memantine is an antagonist at [[Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor|Alpha-7 nAChR]], which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early memantine treatment. [[Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor|Alpha-7 nAChR]] upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic memantine treatment.<ref name=Buisson1998>{{cite journal |vauthors=Buisson B, Bertrand D |title=Open-channel blockers at the human alpha4beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor |journal=Mol Pharmacol. |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=555–63 |date=1 March 1998|pmid=9495824 |url=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9495824 }}</ref><ref name=Aracava2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aracava Y, Pereira EF, Maelicke A, Albuquerque EX |title=Memantine blocks alpha7* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors more potently than n-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in rat hippocampal neurons |journal=J Pharmacol Exp Ther. |volume=312 |issue=3 |pages=1195–205 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15522999 |doi=10.1124/jpet.104.077172 }}</ref> It has been shown that the number of nicotinic receptors in the brain are reduced in Alzheimer's disease, even in the absence of a general decrease in the number of neurons, and [[nicotinic receptor]] [[agonists]] are viewed as interesting targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs.<ref name=Gotti2004>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gotti C, Clementi F |title=Neuronal nicotinic receptors: from structure to pathology |journal=Prog Neurobiol. |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=363–96 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15649582 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2004.09.006 }}</ref>

 
It acts as an agonist at the [[Sigma receptor|σ1 receptor]] with a low K<sub>i</sub> of 2.6 [[micrometre|µm]] (2600&nbsp;nm).<ref name="pmid15090047">{{cite journal |vauthors=Peeters M, Romieu P, Maurice T, Su TP, Maloteaux JM, Hermans E | title = Involvement of the sigma 1 receptor in the modulation of dopaminergic transmission by amantadine | pmid = 15090047 | doi=10.1111/j.0953-816X.2004.03297.x | volume=19 | issue = 8 | date=Apr 2004 | journal=Eur J Neurosci | pages=2212–20}}</ref> The consequences of this activity are unclear (as the role of sigma receptors in general is not yet that well understood) and memantine is probably too weak at the sigma binding site to exhibit significant agonist effects, only exhibiting partial agonism or antagonism. Some of memantine's adverse effects arise through this route.
