The mode of action for ambazone has been studied extensively and has been shown to react via different methods. Ambazone shows low mutagenic activity and no cardiovascular, CNS, metabolic, or gastrointestinal side-effects with I.V. doses up to 10-5&nbsp;mol/kg and oral doses up to 10-3&nbsp;mol/kg.  Ambazone can be administered via oral or I.V. administration, but the problem with oral administration is that one experimental study shows there is only a 35–50% absorption while another study shows 40% in the intestines; These results would tend to lead the reader to think that ambazone would not be the best choice for treatment, because with such a low absorbance, there is going to have to be a greater concentration ingested to gain a positive effect from the drug.  The problem with a greater concentration is that ambazone has a half-life of 6–7 hours.  It was stated above that ambazone possess no CNS side-effects due to the fact, that it will not cross the blood brain barrier.  Although this is the body’s way of protecting unwanted substances from attacking the brain, this also limits the treatment of brain tumors with ambazone.
