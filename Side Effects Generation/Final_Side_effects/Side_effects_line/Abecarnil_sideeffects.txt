'''Abecarnil''' ('''ZK-112,119''') is an [[anxiolytic]] [[drug]] from the [[beta-Carboline|β-Carboline]] family. It is one of a relatively recently developed class of medicines known as the [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s, which have similar effects to the older [[benzodiazepine]] group, but with quite different [[chemical structure]]s. It is a [[partial agonist]] acting [[binding selectivity|selectively]] at the [[GABAA receptor#Target for benzodiazepines|benzodiazepine site]] of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ozawa | first1 = M | last2 = Nakada | first2 = Y | last3 = Sugimachi | first3 = K | last4 = Yabuuchi | first4 = F | last5 = Akai | first5 = T | last6 = Mizuta | first6 = E | last7 = Kuno | first7 = S | last8 = Yamaguchi | first8 = M | date = Mar 1994 | title = Pharmacological characterization of the novel anxiolytic beta-carboline abecarnil in rodents and primates | url = | journal = Japanese Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 64 | issue = 3| pages = 179–87 | doi=10.1254/jjp.64.179 | pmid=7912751}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ozawa M, Nakada Y, Sugimachi K |title=Pharmacological characterization of the novel anxiolytic beta-carboline abecarnil in rodents and primates |journal=Jpn.

Abecarnil is a relatively subtype-selective drug which produces primarily anxiolytic effects, with comparatively less sedative or [[muscle relaxant]] properties,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Krause W, Schutt B, Duka T |date=May 1990 | title = Pharmacokinetics and acute toleration of the beta-carboline derivative abecarnil in man | url = | journal = Arzneimittelforschung | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 529–32 | pmid = 1974428 }}</ref><ref>Duka T, Schutt B, Krause W, Dorow R, McDonald S, Fichte K.
