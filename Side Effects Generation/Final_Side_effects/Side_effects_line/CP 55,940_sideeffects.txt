'''CP 55,940''' is a [[cannabinoid]] which mimics the effects of naturally occurring [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] (one of the psychoactive compounds found in [[cannabis]]). CP 55,940 was created by [[Pfizer]] in 1974 but was never marketed. It is currently used to study the [[endocannabinoid system]].

 
CP 55,940 showed protective effects on rat brain mitochondria upon paraquat exposure.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Velez-Pardo, C. |author2=Jimenez-Del-Rio, M. |author3=Lores-Arnaiz, S. |author4=Bustamante, J. | title = Protective effects of the synthetic cannabinoids CP55,940 and JWH-015 on rat brain mitochondria upon paraquat exposure | journal = Neurochemical Research | year = 2010 | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 1323–1332 | pmid = 20514518 | doi = 10.1007/s11064-010-0188-1 }}</ref>

 
It also showed neuroprotective effects by reducing intracellular calcium release and reducing hippocampal cell death in cultured neurons subjected to high levels of NMDA.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Zhuang, S.
