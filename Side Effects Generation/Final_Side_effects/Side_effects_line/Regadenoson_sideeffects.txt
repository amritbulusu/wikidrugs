'''Regadenoson''' ('''CVT-3146''', '''Lexiscan''') is an [[Adenosine A2a receptor|A<sub>2A</sub>]] [[adenosine receptor]] [[agonist]] that is a coronary [[vasodilator]] that is commonly used in pharmacologic stress testing. It produces [[hyperemia]] quickly and maintains it for a duration that is useful for radionuclide [[myocardial perfusion imaging]].<ref name="pmid15261132">{{cite journal |author=Cerqueira MD |title=The future of pharmacologic stress: selective A2A adenosine receptor agonists |journal=Am.
