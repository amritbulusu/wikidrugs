'''Eticyclidine''' ('''PCE''', '''CI-400''') is a [[Dissociative drug|dissociative]] [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] drug with [[hallucinogen]]ic effects. It is similar in effects to [[phencyclidine]] but is slightly more potent. PCE was developed by Parke-Davis in the 1970s and evaluated for anesthetic potential under the code name CI-400,<ref name="pmid14416411">{{cite journal |vauthors=LEVY L, CAMERON DE, AITKEN RC |title=Observation on two psychotomimetic drugs of piperidine derivation--CI 395 (sernyl) and CI 400 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=116 |issue= |pages=843â€“4 |date=March 1960 |pmid=14416411 |doi= |url=}}</ref> but research into PCE was not continued after the development of [[ketamine]], a similar drug with more favourable properties.<ref>Kalir A, Edery H, Pelah Z, Balderman D, Porath G. 1-Phenylcycloalkylamine derivatives.
