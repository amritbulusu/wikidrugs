It is a [[partial agonist]] for [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] in the brain. [[David Nutt]] from the [[University of Bristol]] has suggested bretazenil as a possible base from which to make a better social drug, as it displays several of the positive effects of [[alcohol]] intoxication such as relaxation and sociability, but without the bad effects such as aggression, [[amnesia]], [[nausea]], loss of coordination, liver disease and brain damage. The effects of bretazenil can also be quickly reversed by the action of [[flumazenil]], which is used as an antidote to [[benzodiazepine overdose]],{{ref|newsci}} in contrast to alcohol for which there is no effective and reliable [[antidote]].

 
Traditional benzodiazepines are associated with side effects such as drowsiness, [[physical dependence]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]] potential. It was hoped that bretazenil and other partial agonists would be an improvement on traditional benzodiazepines which are full agonists due to preclinical evidence that their side effect profile was less than that of full agonist benzodiazepines. For a variety of reasons however, bretazenil and other partial agonists such as [[pazinaclone]] and [[abecarnil]] were not clinically successful. However, research continues into other compounds with partial agonist and compounds which are selective for certain GABA<sub>A</sub> benzodiazepine receptor subtypes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Atack | first1 = JR. | title = The benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors as a target for the development of novel anxiolytics | journal = Expert Opin Investig Drugs | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 601–18 |date=May 2005 | doi = 10.1517/13543784.14.5.601 | pmid = 15926867 }}</ref>

Bretazenil has a more broad spectrum of action than traditional benzodiazepines as it has been shown to have low affinity binding to α<sub>4</sub> and α<sub>6</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in addition to acting on α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>, α<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>5</sub> subunits which traditional benzodiazepine drugs work on.

Partial agonists of benzodiazepine receptors have been proposed as a possible alternative to full agonists of the benzodiazepine site to overcome the problems of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[Substance dependence|dependence]] and [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] which limits the role of benzodiazepines in the treatment of [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]] and [[epilepsy]].
