'''Indalpine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand name '''Upstène'''; developmental code name '''LM-5008''') is an [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) class drug that was briefly marketed.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

They were particularly influenced by the series of "synthesis inhibitor studies" carried out by Shopsin's team during the early to mid-1970s, and in particular, the clinical report by Shopsin et al.

This led to an understanding of the role of the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5HT) in the therapeutic effects of the available [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclic]] and [[MAOI]] class antidepressants. The studies led to widespread recognition of a serotonin hypothesis of depression, contradicting theories that promoted the role of [[norepinephrine]].

 
Meanwhile, zimelidine had been withdrawn soon after its marketing in 1983 due to the emergence of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], a serious neurological disease. With lingering concerns among some Common Market countries and activist groups about the potential of SSRIs to induce adverse effects, and the reported association between indalpine and hematological effects, which emerged in the aftermath of Pharmuka's take over by [[Rhône Poulenc]], indalpine was abruptly taken off the market by Rhône Poulenc, to the surprise of others. Irish psychiatrist David Healy characterized indalpine as being "born at the wrong time" during a period when "indalpine and psychiatry was under siege" by different interest groups in some of the Common Market countries.<ref>3. From Book Let Em Eat Prozac by David Healy, 2004</ref> In line with indalpine's fate, research and development was halted relating to the 2 other 4-alkyl-piperidine derivatives developed by Pharmuka, [[viqualine]] (a [[serotonin releasing agent]]) and [[pipequaline]] (a [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] [[positive allosteric modulator]]), both in different stages of development at the time.[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aejaz_Ahmed/publication/270512329_Available_online_www_The_Importance_of_Six_Membered_Saturated_Nitrogen_Containing_Ring_in_Psychological_disorders/links/54acc5430cf21c47713a73a6.pdf]
