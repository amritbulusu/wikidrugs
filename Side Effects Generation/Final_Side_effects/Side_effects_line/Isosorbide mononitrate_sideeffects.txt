==Side-effects==

 
Adverse effects associated with the clinical use of the drug are as expected with all nitrate preparations. They occur mainly in the early stages of treatment.

 
* [[Sildenafil]] (Viagra). Concomitant administration of isosorbide mononitrate and sildenafil (Viagra) or other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Tadalafil and Udenafil) can potentiate the vasodilatory effect of isosorbide mononitrate with the potential result of serious side-effects such as [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] or [[myocardial infarction]]. Life-threatening hypotension may also occur. Therefore, sildenafil should not be given to patients already receiving isosorbide mononitrate therapy.
