'''Matuzumab''' (formerly '''EMD 72000''') is a [[humanized monoclonal antibody]] for the treatment of cancer. It binds to the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) with high affinity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Murthy|first=U.|author2=Basu, A |author3=Rodeck, U. |author4=Herlyn, M. |author5=Ross, A.H. |author6=Das, M. |journal=Arch Biochem Biophys|year=1987|volume=252|issue=2|pages=549–60|pmid=2434025|title=Binding of an antagonistic monoclonal antibody to an intact and fragmented EGF-receptor polypeptide|doi=10.1016/0003-9861(87)90062-2}}</ref>  The mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb425) from which matuzumab was derived was developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania <ref>{{cite journal|last=Rodeck|first=U.|author2=Herlyn, M. |author3=Herlyn, D. |author4=Molthoff, C. |author5=Atkinson, B. |author6=Varello, M. |author7=Steplewski, Z. |author8=Koprowski, H. |journal=Cancer Research|year=1987|volume=47|issue=14|pages=3692–6|pmid=3297307 |title=Tumor growth modulation by a monoclonal antibody to the epidermal growth factor receptor: immunologically mediated and effector cell-independent effects.}}</ref>

Matuzumab binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the outer membrane of normal and tumor cells.  The matuzumab epitope has been mapped to domain III of the extracellular domain of the EGFR.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schmiedel|first=J.|author2=Blaukat, A. |author3=Li, S. |author4=Knochel, T. |author5=Ferguson, K.M. |journal=Cancer Cell|year=2008|volume=13|issue=4|pages=365–73|pmid=18394550 |doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2008.03.010 |title=A molecular view of anti-ErbB monoclonal antibody therapy.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kamat|first=V. |author2=Donaldson, J.M |author3=Kari, C. |author4=Quadros, M.R.D. |author5=Lelkes, P.I. |author6=Chaiken, I. |author7=Cocklin, S. |author8=Williams, J.C. |author9=Papazoglou, E. |author10=Rodeck, U. |journal=Cancer Biology & Therapy|year=2008|volume=7|issue=5|pages=726–33|pmid=18424917|title=Enhanced EGFR inhibition and distinct epitope recognition by EGFR antagonistic mAbs C225 and 425.|doi=10.4161/cbt.7.5.6097}}</ref>  The EGFR is receptor tyrosine kinase which binds multiple growth factors including EGF ([[epidermal growth factor]]) and other members of the EGF family of [[growth factor]]s, resulting in activation of its tyrosine kinase activity.  Activation of the EGFR  has diverse effects on target cells depending on cell type and tissue context.  It directs cell fate decision relating to cell growth, survival and, differentiation. Development of matuzumab and other antibodies to the EGFR (for example [[cetuximab]]) as cancer therapeutics was motivated by observations that EGFR expression and/or signaling is frequently upregulated in cancer cells.
