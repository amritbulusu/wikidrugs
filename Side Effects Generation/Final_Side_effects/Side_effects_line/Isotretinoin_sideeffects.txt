Isotretinoin is primarily used as a treatment for severe acne. The most common adverse effects are a transient worsening of acne (lasting 1-4 months), dry lips ([[cheilitis]]), dry and fragile skin, and an [[Photosensitivity|increased susceptibility to sunburn]].  Uncommon and rare side effects include muscle aches and pains ([[myalgia]]s), and headaches. Isotretinoin is known to cause [[teratogen|birth defects]] due to in utero exposure because of the molecule's close resemblance to [[retinoic acid]], a natural vitamin A derivative which controls normal embryonic development. It is also associated with psychiatric side effects, including depression.

 
In the United States, a special procedure is required to obtain the pharmaceutical. In most other countries, a consent form is required which explains these risks. Women taking isotretinoin must not get pregnant during and for 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy. [[Sexual abstinence]] or effective contraception is mandatory during this period. Barrier methods by themselves (e.g., [[condom]]s) are not considered adequate due to the unacceptable [[Comparison of birth control methods|failure rates]] of approximately 3%. Women who fall pregnant whilst on isotretinoin therapy are generally counselled to have a [[Abortion|termination]]. Isotretinoin has no effect on male fertility.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Millsop JW, Heller MM, Eliason MJ, Murase JE |title=Dermatological medication effects on male fertility |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=337–46 |year=2013 |pmid=23914891 |doi=10.1111/dth.12069 }}</ref>

 
In the United States, dispensing of isotretinoin is by an [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-mandated website called [[iPLEDGE]]. iPLEDGE has applied to isotretinoin prescriptions since 1 March 2006. Under it, dermatologists must register their patients on the system before prescribing isotretinoin. Pharmacists must then verify the prescription on the iPLEDGE website before dispensing isotretinoin. The website allows no more than thirty days' supply of the drug to be prescribed or dispensed; and after issuance, another prescription may not be written for at least 30 days (even in the case of lost prescriptions). Prescriptions expire from iPLEDGE if not picked up from the pharmacy seven days after issuance. Physicians and pharmacists must verify written prescriptions on the system before filling an isotretinoin prescription. Due to the teratogenic effects of isotretinoin, iPLEDGE makes additional requirements of female patients filling prescriptions for the drug: women with child-bearing potential must commit to using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for the duration of isotretinoin therapy and for a month immediately preceding and a month immediately following therapy. Additionally they must have two negative pregnancy tests 30 days apart and have negative pregnancy tests before each prescription is written.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ipledgeprogram.com/AboutiPLEDGE.aspx|title=iPledge (About iPledge)}}</ref> Alerts continue to exist against purchasing isotretinoin online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm094305.htm|title=Isotretinoin (marketed as Accutane) Capsule Information|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)}}</ref>

The most common side effects are mucocutaneous: dry lips, skin and nose. Other common mucocutaneous side effects are inflammation and chapping of the lips ([[cheilitis]]), redness of the skin ([[erythema]]), rashes, peeling, eczema ([[dermatitis]]), itching ([[Itch|prunitis]]) and nose bleeds ([[Nosebleed|epistaxis]]).<ref name=Brelsford2008rev>{{cite journal|last1=Brelsford|first1=M|last2=Beute|first2=TC|title=Preventing and managing the side effects of isotretinoin.|journal=Seminars in cutaneous medicine and surgery|date=September 2008|volume=27|issue=3|pages=197–206|doi=10.1016/j.sder.2008.07.002|pmid=18786498}}</ref> Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not taking the drug as advised), as it occurs in almost all patients.<ref name=Brelsford2008rev/>

For this reason waxing of hair, tattooing, tattoo removal, piercings, dermabrasion, exfoliation, etc. are not recommended. Treatment of acne scars is generally deferred until 12 months after completion of a course of isotretinoin.

 
===Psychological effects===

 
The association between isotretinoin use and psychopathology has been controversial. Beginning in 1983, isolated case reports emerged suggesting mood change, particularly depression, occurring during or soon after isotretinoin use.<ref name=bjd2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodfield MJ, Cox NH, Bowser A, McMillan JC, Millard LG, Simpson NB, Ormerod AD | title = Advice on the safe introduction and continued use of isotretinoin in acne in the U.K. 2010 | journal = British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 162 | issue = 6 | pages = 1172–1179 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21250961 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.09836.x | url = http://www.bad.org.uk/Portals/_Bad/Guidelines/Clinical%20Guidelines/Isotretinoin%20Guidelines%202010.pdf | issn = 0007-0963  | format = PDF }}</ref> A number of studies have been conducted since then of the drug's effect on depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and other psychological effects.<ref name=bjd2010/>

 
The product information leaflet distributed with isotretinoin states that rare psychological side effects may include depression, worsening of pre-existing depression, aggressive tendencies and anxiety. Very rare effects include abnormal behaviour, [[psychosis]], suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and [[suicide]].<ref name=UKLabel2015/> In a total of 5577 [[Adverse drug reaction|adverse reactions]] reported to the UK's [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] up to 31 March 2017, the majority (1207, or 22%) concerned psychiatric effects.<ref name=MHRAreport>{{Cite web|url=https://info.mhra.gov.uk/drug-analysis-profiles/dap.html?drug=./UK_EXTERNAL/NONCOMBINED/UK_NON_000285965613.zip&agency=MHRA|title=Interactive Drug Analysis Profile - Isotretinoin|last=|first=|date=31 March 2017|website=mhra.gov.uk|publisher=Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> There were 85 reports of suicidal ideation, 56 of completed suicide and 43 of suicide attempts.<ref name=MHRAreport/> Isotretinoin is the only non-psychiatric drug on the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s top 10 list of drugs associated with depression<ref name=Kontaxakis2009rev/> and is also within the top 10 for suicide attempts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wysowski|first=D.

Isotretinoin has a number of [[Human musculoskeletal system|muscoloskeletal]] effects. [[Myalgia]] (muscular pain) and [[arthralgia]] (joint pain) are very common side effects.<ref name="Brelsford_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brelsford M, Beute TC | title = Preventing and managing the side effects of isotretinoin | journal = Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–206 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18786498 | doi = 10.1016/j.sder.2008.07.002 }}</ref>  [[Retinoid]]s, including isotretinoin, are well-known to cause bone changes, the most common type of which is [[Hyperostosis|hyperostotic changes]] (excessive bone growth), especially in growing children and adolescents.<ref name="Brelsford_2008" /> Other problems include premature [[Epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal closure]] and [[calcification]] of tendons and ligaments.<ref name="Brelsford_2008" /> The bones of the spine and feet are most commonly affected. Risk factors for skeletal effects include older age, greater dosage and longer course of treatment. Most bone changes cause no symptoms and may only be noticed using [[X-ray|X-ray imaging]].<ref name="Brelsford_2008" />

 
Isotretinoin and other retinoids are well known to affect the eyes. [[Dry eye syndrome|Dry eyes]] are very common during treatment and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the [[meibomian gland]]s. Some patients develop contact lens intolerance as a result.<ref name=Brelsford2008rev/> In some patients, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent [[Meibomian gland dysfunction|Meibomian Gland Dysfunction]] (MGD).<ref name=Moy2015rev/> Other common effects on the eyes include inflammation of the eyelid ([[blepharitis]]), red eye caused by [[conjunctivitis]] and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), [[Color blindness|colour blindness]], development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea ([[keratitis]]), swelling of the optic disk ([[Papilledema|papilloedema]], associated with [[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension|IIH]]), [[photophobia]] and other visual disturbances.<ref name=UKLabel2015>{{cite web|title=Roaccutane 20mg Soft Capsules - Summary of Product Characteristics|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/21511|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|language=en|date=1 July 2015}}</ref>

 
Isotretinoin's exact [[mechanism of action]] is unknown, but several studies have shown that isotretinoin induces [[apoptosis]] (programmatic cell death) in various cells in the body.
