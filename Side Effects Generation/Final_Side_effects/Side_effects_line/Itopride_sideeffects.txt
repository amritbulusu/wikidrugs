Patients taking itopride should report any side-effects to their treating physician.

 
The most common side-effects of itopride include mild to moderate abdominal pain and diarrhoea.<ref name="Huang-2012"/> Some other side effects that may occur include: [[rash]], giddiness, exhaustion, back or chest pain, increased salivation, [[constipation]], [[headache]], sleeping disorders, dizziness, [[galactorrhea]], and [[gynecomastia]].

 
Other side effects may also be present.

 
Central nervous system adverse effects do not tend to occur due to poor penetration across the blood brain barrier, although a slight raising of prolactin levels may occur.<ref name="Huang-2012"/> Raising of prolactin levels is more common with high dose regimes of itopride.<ref name="Kim-2005">{{Cite journal|last1=Kim |first1=YS. |last2=Kim |first2=TH. |last3=Choi |first3=CS. |last4=Shon |first4=YW. |last5=Kim |first5=SW. |last6=Seo |first6=GS. |last7=Nah |first7=YH. |last8=Choi |first8=MG. |last9=Choi |first9=SC. |title=Effect of itopride, a new prokinetic, in patients with mild GERD: a pilot study |url=http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/11/4210.pdf |format=PDF |journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=11 |issue=27 |pages=4210–4 |date=Jul 2005 |doi= |pmid=16015691 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005025913/http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/11/4210.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= |pmc=4615444}}</ref>

 
Later, in a study conducted with healthy adult volunteers, itopride was shown as unlikely to cause cardiac arrhythmias or ECG changes in part to the lack of significant interaction and metabolism via the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme pathway, unlike [[cisapride]] and [[mosapride]], as it is metabolized by a different enzyme set. New molecular studies on guinea pig ventricular [[myocytes]] also supported the cardiac safety profile of itopride, as it did not affect certain potassium mechanisms that may have been affected by cisapride or mosapride. Moreover, itopride has no affinity for the [[5-HT4 receptor|5-HT<sub>4</sub>]] receptors, unlike other [[benzamides]] such as cisapride and mosapride, which are 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonists. The affinity of cisapride for 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in the heart has been implicated in the undesirable cardiac effects of cisapride itself.

 
There is evidence  that itopride may have prokinetic effects throughout the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach to the end of the colon.<ref name="Lim-2008">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lim | first1 = HC. | last2 = Kim | first2 = YG. | last3 = Lim | first3 = JH. | last4 = Kim | first4 = HS. | last5 = Park | first5 = H. | title = Effect of itopride hydrochloride on the ileal and colonic motility in guinea pig in vitro | journal = Yonsei Med J | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 472–8 |date=Jun 2008 | doi = 10.3349/ymj.2008.49.3.472 | pmid = 18581598 | pmc=2615341}}</ref> The pharmacokinetics of itopride appear to differ between Asian and Caucasian populations, with Caucasians having 30-50 percent lower blood levels of itopride after oral administration.<ref name="Stevens-2008">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Stevens | first1 = JE. | last2 = Russo | first2 = A. | last3 = Maddox | first3 = AF. | last4 = Rayner | first4 = CK. | last5 = Phillips | first5 = L. | last6 = Talley | first6 = NJ. | last7 = Giguère | first7 = M. | last8 = Horowitz | first8 = M. | last9 = Jones | first9 = KL. | title = Effect of itopride on gastric emptying in longstanding diabetes mellitus | journal = Neurogastroenterol Motil | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 456–63 |date=May 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2007.01058.x | pmid = 18179609  }}</ref> Itopride poorly penetrates across the blood brain barrier because of its high polarity and thus itopride does not tend to cause any [[central nervous system]] adverse effects.<ref name="Huang-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Huang | first1 = X. | last2 = Lv | first2 = B. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = S. | last4 = Fan | first4 = YH. | last5 = Meng | first5 = LN. | title = Itopride therapy for functional dyspepsia: a meta-analysis | journal = World J Gastroenterol | volume = 18 | issue = 48 | pages = 7371–7 |date=Dec 2012 | doi = 10.3748/wjg.v18.i48.7371 | pmid = 23326147 | pmc=3544044}}</ref> Itopride has no effect on [[potassium channels]].<ref name="Morisawa-1999">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Morisawa | first1 = T. | last2 = Hasegawa | first2 = J. | last3 = Hama | first3 = R. | last4 = Kitano | first4 = M. | last5 = Kishimoto | first5 = Y. | last6 = Kawasaki | first6 = H. | title = Effects of itopride hydrochloride on the delayed rectifier K+ and L-type CA2+ currents in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes | journal = Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol | volume = 106 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 37–45 | month =  | year = 1999 | doi =  | pmid = 11127807 }}</ref>

 
Itopride given as a single dose study found that it also raises levels of [[motilin]], [[somatostatin]] and lowers levels of [[cholecystokinin]], as well as [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]. These effects may also contribute to itopride's pharmacology.<ref name="Katagiri-2006">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Katagiri | first1 = F. | last2 = Shiga | first2 = T. | last3 = Inoue | first3 = S. | last4 = Sato | first4 = Y. | last5 = Itoh | first5 = H. | last6 = Takeyama | first6 = M. | title = Effects of itopride hydrochloride on plasma gut-regulatory peptide and stress-related hormone levels in healthy human subjects | journal = Pharmacology | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 115–21 | month =  | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1159/000093485 | pmid = 16717477 }}</ref>

 
It is worth noting that itopride is a relatively new drug and that it is, therefore, possible that other drugs may interact with itopride, rendering contraindications or side effects that are not currently known.
