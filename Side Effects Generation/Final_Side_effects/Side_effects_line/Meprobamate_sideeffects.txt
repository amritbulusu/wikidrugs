'''Meprobamate''' — marketed as '''''Miltown''''' by [[Wallace Laboratories]] and '''''Equanil''''' by [[Wyeth]], among others — is a [[carbamate]] derivative used as an [[anxiolytic]] drug. It was the best-selling [[minor tranquilizer]] for a time, but has largely been replaced by the [[benzodiazepine]]s due to their wider [[therapeutic index]] (lower risk of toxicity at therapeutically prescribed doses) and lower incidence of serious side effects.

 
In the mid-1940s, Frank Milan Berger was working in a laboratory of a British drug company, looking for a preservative for penicillin, when he noticed that a compound called [[mephenesin]] had a sedative effect in laboratory rodents. Berger subsequently referred to this sedating or “tranquilizing” effect in a now-historic article, published by ''The British Journal of Pharmacology'' in 1946. However, there were three major drawbacks to the use of mephenesin as a tranquilizer: a very short duration of action, greater effect on the spinal cord than on the brain, and a weak activity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berger FM. | title = Mode of Action of Myanesin | journal = [[Br J Pharmacol]]. | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 241–250 | year = 1947 | doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1947.tb00341.x}}</ref> In May 1950, after moving to [[Carter Products]] in New Jersey, Berger and a chemist, Bernard John Ludwig, synthesized a chemically related tranquilizing compound, meprobamate, that was able to overcome these three drawbacks.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01156a086 |vauthors=Ludwig BJ, Piech E | title = Some anticonvulsant agents derived from 1, 3-propanediol | journal = J Am Chem Soc. | volume = 73 | issue = 12 | pages = 5779–5781 | year = 1951 }}</ref>  Wallace Laboratories, a subsidiary of Carter Products, bought the license and named their new product "Miltown" after the borough of [[Milltown, New Jersey|Milltown]] in [[New Jersey]].

On January 19, 2012, the [[European Medicines Agency]] withdrew marketing authorization in the [[European Union]] for all medicines containing meprobamate, "due to serious side effects seen with the medicine."  The Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) "concluded that the benefits of meprobamate do not outweigh its risks."<ref>

 
Although it was marketed as being safer, meprobamate has most of the pharmacological effects and dangers of the [[barbiturate]]s and acts at the barbiturate binding site (though it is less sedating at effective doses). It is reported to have some anticonvulsant properties against [[absence seizure]]s, but can exacerbate generalized [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s.

 
Meprobamate's mechanism of action is not completely known. It has been shown in animal studies to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the [[thalamus]] and [[limbic system]]. Meprobamate binds to [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]]<ref name="pmid9067327">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rho JM, Donevan SD, Rogawski MA |title=Barbiturate-like actions of the propanediol dicarbamates felbamate and meprobamate |journal=J.

Meprobamate is licensed for the short-term relief of anxiety, although it is not known whether the purported anti-anxiety effects of meprobamate are separable from its sedative effects. Its effectiveness as a selective agent for the treatment of anxiety has not been proven in humans,<ref>{{Cite book
