Kainic acid is commonly injected into laboratory animal models to study the effects of [[Ablative brain surgery|experimental ablation]]. Kainic acid is a direct agonist of the glutamic kainate receptors and large doses of concentrated solutions produce immediate neuronal death by overstimulating neurons to death. Such damage and death of neurons is referred to as an [[excitotoxic]] lesion. Thus, in large, concentrated doses kainic acid can be considered a neurotoxin, and in small doses of dilute solution kainic acid will chemically stimulate neurons.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Physiology of Behavior|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|pages=152}}</ref>

 
Electrical stimulation of designated areas of the brain are generally administered by passing an electric current through a wire that is inserted into the brain to lesion a particular area of the brain. Electrical stimulation indiscriminately destroys anything in the vicinity of the electrode tip, including neural bodies and axons of neurons passing through; therefore it is difficult to attribute the effects of the lesion to a single area. Chemical stimulation is typically administered through a cannula that is inserted into the brain via [[stereotactic surgery]]. Chemical stimulation, while more complicated than electrical stimulation, has the distinct advantage of activating cell bodies, but not nearby axons, because only cell bodies and subsequent dendrites contain glutamate receptors. Therefore, chemical stimulation by kainic acid is more localized than electrical stimulation. It is important to note that both chemical and electrical [[lesions]] potentially cause additional damage to the brain due to the very nature of the inserted electrode or cannula. Therefore, the most effective [[Ablative brain surgery|ablation studies]] are performed in comparison to a sham lesion that duplicates all the steps of producing a brain lesion except the one that actually causes the brain damage, that is, injection of kainic acid or administration of an electrical shock.
