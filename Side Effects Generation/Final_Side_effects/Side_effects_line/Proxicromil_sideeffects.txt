== Efficacy, toxicity and side effects ==

 
Proxicromil is tested through a variety of independent studies for its beneficial effect as an anti-allergen, its efficacy against migraine, asthma and tumor enhancement. It shows no effect as a prophylactic against migraine. The reported side effects during this study related mainly to transient gastrointestinal troubles and were generally of a mild nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koch-Henriksen, Sehested|first=N.I.L.S., P.|year=1979|title=FPL 57787 and migraine prophylaxis|url=|journal=Acta Neurologica Scandinavica|volume=59 |issue=2|pages=154–155|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=R.|year=1980|title=Clinical study of a new orally active chromone in asthma-proxicromil (FPL 57787)|url=|journal=Clin Allergy|volume=10 |issue=6|pages=715–720|via=}}</ref>
