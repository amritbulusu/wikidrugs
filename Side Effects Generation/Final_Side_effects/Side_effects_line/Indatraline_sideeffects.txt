'''Indatraline''' ('''Lu 19-005''') is a non-[[binding selectivity|selective]] [[monoamine transporter]] inhibitor that has been shown to block the [[reuptake]] of [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]] with effects similar to those of [[cocaine]]. However, the effects have been shown to have slower onset and longer duration than cocaine, suggesting that the compound may, along with similar compounds, be used for treatment of cocaine addiction.<ref>{{Cite journal
