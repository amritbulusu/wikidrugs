'''Pimobendan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], or '''pimobendane'''; tradenames '''Vetmedin,''' '''Acardi''', and '''Heartmedin''') is a veterinary medication. It is a calcium sensitizer and a selective inhibitor of [[phosphodiesterase 3]] (PDE3) with positive [[inotropic]] and [[vasodilator]] effects.

 
Pimobendan is a positive [[inotrope]] (increases myocardial contractility). It sensitizes and increases the binding efficiency of cardiac troponin in the [[myofibril]] to the calcium ions that are already present in systole. In normal hearts it increases the consumption of oxygen and energy to the same degree as dobutamine but in diseased hearts it may not.<ref>Hata K1, Goto Y, Futaki S, Ohgoshi Y, Yaku H, Kawaguchi O, Takasago T, Saeki A, Taylor TW, Nishioka T, et al.

Mechanoenergetic effect of pimobendan in failing dog hearts. Heart Vessels. 1997;Suppl 12:103-5.</ref> Pimobendan also causes peripheral [[vasodilation]] by inhibiting the function of [[PDE3|phosphodiesterase III]]. This results in decreased resistance to blood flow through systemic arterioles, which decreases [[afterload]] (decreases the failing heart's workload) and reduces the amount of mitral regurgitation.<ref>Verdouw PD, Hartog JM, Duncker DJ, Roth W, Saxena PR.

*An [[ACE inhibitor]], often [[enalapril]] (trade name Enacard) or [[benazepril]] (Fortekor). These drugs inhibit the action of [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]], producing a balanced vasodilation, along with other potentially favorable effects.
