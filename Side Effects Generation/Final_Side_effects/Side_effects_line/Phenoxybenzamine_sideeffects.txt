It was also the first [[alpha blocker]] to be used for treatment of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Caine M, Perlberg S, Meretyk S |title=A placebo-controlled double-blind study of the effect of phenoxybenzamine in benign prostatic obstruction |journal=British journal of urology |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=551â€“4 |year=1978 |pmid=88984 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.1978.tb06210.x}}</ref> although it is currently seldom used for that indication due to unfavourable side effects.

 
Clinically, non-selective alpha antagonists block alpha receptors (but do not differentiate between alpha-1 and alpha-2). They are used as antihypertensives because they block alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction. The block on alpha-2 receptors further potentiates beta-effects, increasing cardiac output.

 
Phenoxybenzamine has a long-lasting action, binding covalently to the alpha receptors. Its only current clinical use is in preparing patients with [[pheochromocytoma]] for surgery; its irreversible antagonism and the resultant depression in the maximum of the agonist dose-response curve are desirable in a situation where surgical manipulation of the tumour may release a large bolus of pressor amine into the circulation. Typically, phenoxybenzamine is not used in the long term, as new receptors are made to upregulate alpha stimulation. The main limiting side-effects of alpha antagonists is that the baroreceptor reflex is disrupted and thus this can cause postural hypotension.
