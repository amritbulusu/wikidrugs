Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human [[Mercury poisoning|poisonings]]. The mechanisms of toxic action are unknown. Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a [[half-life]] of about 18 days in adults by breakdown into other chemicals, including inorganic mercury. Ethylmercury is eliminated from the brain in about 14 days in infant monkeys. Risk assessment for effects on the nervous system have been made by extrapolating from dose-response relationships for [[methylmercury]].<ref name=Clarkson/> Methylmercury and ethylmercury distribute to all body tissues, crossing the [[blood–brain barrier]] and the [[placental barrier]], and ethylmercury also moves freely throughout the body.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarkson TW, Vyas JB, Ballatori N |title=Mechanisms of mercury disposition in the body |journal= Am J Ind Med |volume=50 |issue=10 |pages=757–64 |year=2007 |pmid=17477364 |doi=10.1002/ajim.20476 }}</ref> Concerns based on extrapolations from methylmercury caused thiomersal to be removed from U.S. childhood vaccines, starting in 1999.
