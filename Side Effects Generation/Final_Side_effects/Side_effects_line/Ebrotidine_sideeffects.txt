'''Ebrotidine''' is an [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist]] with gastroprotective activity against [[ethanol]]-, [[aspirin]]- or stress-induced [[gastric mucosa]]l damage.<ref name = Patel>{{cite journal | author = Patel SS, Wilde MI | title = Ebrotidine | journal = Drugs | volume = 51 |date=Jun 1996 | pages = 974â€“980 | pmid = 8736619 | issue = 6 | doi=10.2165/00003495-199651060-00006}}</ref> The antisecretory properties of ebrotidine are similar to those of [[ranitidine]], and approximately 10-fold greater than those of [[cimetidine]]. Ebrotidine has anti-''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' activity via inhibition of the [[urease]] enzyme and the proteolytic and mucolytic activities of the bacterium. However, its activity is synergistic with a number of antibacterial agents. Ebrotidine counteracts the inhibitory effects of ''H. pylori'' lipopolysaccharides.
