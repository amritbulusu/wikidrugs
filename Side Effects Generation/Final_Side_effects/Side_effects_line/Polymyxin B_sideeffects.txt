'''Polymyxin B''' is an [[antibiotic]] primarily used for resistant [[Gram-negative]] infections.  It is derived from the bacterium ''[[Bacillus polymyxa]]''. Polymyxin B is composed of a number of related compounds (see "[[#Mixture composition|Mixture composition]]").  It has a bactericidal action against almost all Gram-negative bacilli except the [[Proteus (bacterium)|''Proteus'']] and ''[[Neisseria]]'' genera. Polymyxins bind to the cell membrane and alter its structure, making it more permeable. The resulting water uptake leads to cell death.  Polymyxins are [[cationic]], [[Basic (chemistry)|basic]] peptides that act like detergents ([[surfactant]]s).  Side effects include neurotoxicity and acute renal tubular necrosis. Polymyxins are used in the topical first-aid preparation [[Neosporin]].
