Fluparoxan showed α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors antagonist activity in vivo in several animal species.<ref name="pmid1677298" /> In the conscious mouse, fluparoxan was effective by the oral route in preventing [[clonidine]]-induced [[hypothermia]] and [[antinociception]].

Fluparoxan, orally prevented agonist UK-14304 induced sedation and [[bradycardia]] in a dose-related fashion in the dog.  Fluparoxan has been shown to possess central α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist activity after both single and repeated oral doses in man, significantly attenuating all responses to the agonist clonidine (growth hormone secretion, bradycardia, [[hypotension]], [[xerostomia]]) apart from the measures of sedation.<ref name="pmid7669482">{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson MA, Blackwell CP, Smith J | title = Antagonism of the effects of clonidine by the alpha 2‐adrenoceptor antagonist, fluparoxan | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 477–483| date= May 1995 | pmid = 7669482 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb04483.x | pmc=1365053}}</ref>

 
Fluparoxan has shown positive effects in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients when orally dosed with fluparoxan,<ref name="pmid26996616" /> and in the treatment of central neurodegenerative disorders in models of Alzheimer's disease where it prevented age-related decline in spatial working memory in [[transgenic mice]], although it had no effect in other memory tasks such as object recognition or the [[Morris water maze]] and occurred in the absence of obvious concomitant change in pathology such as [[β-amyloid]] plaque load and [[astrocytosis]].<ref name="pmid20850464">{{cite journal |vauthors=Scullion GA, Kendall DA, Marsden CA, Sunter D, Pardon MC | title = Chronic treatment with the α <sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist fluparoxan prevents age-related deficits in spatial working memory in APP× PS1 transgenic mice without altering β-amyloid plaque load or astrocytosis | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–234 | date= March 2011 | pmid = 20850464 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.09.002 | url =  }}</ref>

 
Although fluparoxan has been shown to possess central α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist activity after both single and repeated oral doses in man, clinical evaluation in depression and its development for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction was discontinued in the early 1990s when the compound failed to show a clear clinical advantage over existing therapies. The same is true for other α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists in depression and it is now generally agreed that the original hypothesis that blocking α<sub>2</sub>-presynaptic adrenoceptors to increase brain levels of noradrenalin is insufficient as a neurobiological basis for depressive disorders, with the true picture likely to be much more complex and heterogeneous, involving both [[monoaminergic]] and nonmonoaminergic players.<ref name="pmid18172175">{{cite journal |vauthors=Belmaker RH, Agam G | title = Major depressive disorder | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 358 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–68 | date= January 2008 | pmid = 18172175 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra073096 | url =  }}</ref> In contrast however, recent interest in fluparoxan has increased with its positive effects in treating cognitive dysfunction in central [[neurodegenerative diseases]].<ref name="pmid26996616" />
