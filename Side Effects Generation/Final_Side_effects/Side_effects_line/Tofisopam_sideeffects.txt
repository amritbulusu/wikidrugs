'''Tofisopam'''<ref>DE Patent 2122070</ref> ('''Emandaxin''', '''Grandaxin''', '''Sériel''') is an [[anxiolytic]] that is marketed in several [[Europe]]an countries.<ref name="TaylorFrancis2000">{{cite book | title = Index Nominum 2000: International Drug Directory | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&pg=PA1041 | date = January 2000 | publisher = Taylor & Francis | isbn = 978-3-88763-075-1 | page = 1041}}</ref> Chemically, it is a 2,3-benzodiazepine.

While it may not be an anticonvulsant in and of itself, it has been shown to enhance the anticonvulsant action of classical 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam (but not [[sodium valproate]], [[carbamazepine]], [[phenobarbital]], or [[phenytoin]]).<ref name=curiouser_and_curiouser>{{cite journal | first = V. | last = Saano | year = 1986 | title = Tofizopam selectively increases the action of anticonvulsants | journal = Medical Biology | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 201–6 | pmid = 3023768}}</ref> Tofisopam is indicated for the treatment of [[anxiety]] and [[alcohol withdrawal]], and is prescribed in a dosage of 50–300&nbsp;mg per day divided into three doses. Peak plasma levels are attained two hours after an oral dose. Tofisopam is not reported as causing dependence to the same extent as other benzodiazepines, but is still recommended to be prescribed for a maximum of 12 weeks.

 
Tofisopam is not approved for sale in the United States or Canada. However, [[Vela Pharmaceuticals]] of New Jersey is developing the <small>D</small>-[[enantiomer]] (dextofisopam) as a treatment for [[irritable bowel syndrome]],<ref name=dtfp_ibs>{{cite web|author=Vela Pharmaceuticals |year=2005 |url=http://www.velapharm.com/news/press050104.html |title=Vela Announces Positive Phase 2 Results for Dextofisopam in Treating Irritable Bowel Syndrome - IBS: Results Show Effects of Dextofisopam Both in Women and in Men |work=VelaPharm - News |accessdate=21 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502010007/http://www.velapharm.com/news/press050104.html |archivedate=May 2, 2005 }}</ref> with moderate efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials so far.<ref>Leventer SM, Raudibaugh K, Frissora CL, Kassem N, Keogh JC, Phillips J, Mangel AW.

Tofisopam is also claimed to be a [[Phosphodiesterase inhibitor|PDE<sub>10A</sub> inhibitor]], which may provide an alternative mechanism of action for its various therapeutic effects, and this action has been proposed to make tofisopam potentially useful as a treatment for [[schizophrenia]].<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/WO2007082546.html Nielsen EB, Kehler J, Nielsen J, Brøsen P.
