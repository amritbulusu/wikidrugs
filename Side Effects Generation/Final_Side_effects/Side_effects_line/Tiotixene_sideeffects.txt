Tiotixene acts primarily as a highly potent [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[dopamine]] [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]] and [[D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub> receptor]]s (subnanomolar [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]]).<ref name="PDSP" /> It is also an antagonist of the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]], [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|Î±<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]], and [[serotonin]] [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor]]s (low nanomolar affinity), as well as of various other receptors to a much lesser extent (lower affinity).<ref name="PDSP" /> It does not have any [[anticholinergic]] activity.<ref name="PDSP" /> Antagonism of the D<sub>2</sub> receptor is thought to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects of tiotixene.
