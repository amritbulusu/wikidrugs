Elevated levels of progesterone potently reduce the sodium-retaining activity of aldosterone, resulting in natriuresis and a reduction in extracellular fluid volume. Progesterone withdrawal, on the other hand, is associated with a temporary increase in sodium retention (reduced natriuresis, with an increase in extracellular fluid volume) due to the compensatory increase in aldosterone production, which combats the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor by the previously elevated level of progesterone.<ref name="pmid13263410">{{cite journal | vauthors = Landau RL, Bergenstal DM, Lugibihl K, Kascht ME | title = The metabolic effects of progesterone in man | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 1194–215 | date = October 1955 | pmid = 13263410 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-15-10-1194 }}</ref>

Previous studies have shown that progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue.

Damage incurred by traumatic brain injury is believed to be caused in part by mass [[depolarization]] leading to [[excitotoxicity]].

Not only does progesterone help prevent further damage, it has also been shown to aid in [[neuroregeneration]]. One of the serious effects of traumatic brain injury includes edema.
