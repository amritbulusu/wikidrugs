Some research has been carried out on carnitine supplementation in athletes, given its role in fatty acid metabolism; however, individual responses varied significantly in the 300 people involved in one study.{{vague|date=February 2017}}<ref name="sport"/>  Carnitine has been studied in various cardiometabolic conditions, with a bit of evidence pointing towards efficacy as an adjunct in [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]].  However, there are insufficient trials to determine its efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mingorance|first1=Carmen|last2=Rodríguez-Rodríguez|first2=Rosalía|last3=Justo|first3=María Luisa|last4=Álvarez de Sotomayor|first4=María|last5=Herrera|first5=María Dolores|title=Critical update for the clinical use of L-carnitine analogs in cardiometabolic disorders|journal=Vascular Health and Risk Management|date=1 January 2011|volume=7|pages=169–176|doi=10.2147/VHRM.S14356|pmc=3072740|issn=1176-6344}}</ref>  Carnitine has no effect on preventing mortality associated with cardiovascular conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shang|first1=Ruiping|last2=Sun|first2=Zhiqi|last3=Li|first3=Hui|title=Effective dosing of L-carnitine in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=BMC Cardiovascular Disorders|date=21 July 2014|volume=14|pages=88|doi=10.1186/1471-2261-14-88|pmid=25044037|issn=1471-2261}}</ref>  Carnitine has no effect on serum lipids, except a possible lowering of [[LDL]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Haohai|last2=Song|first2=Lijun|last3=Zhang|first3=Hua|last4=Zhang|first4=Hanbin|last5=Zhang|first5=Jiping|last6=Zhao|first6=Wenchang|title=Influence of L-carnitine supplementation on serum lipid profile in hemodialysis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Kidney & Blood Pressure Research|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=31–41|doi=10.1159/000355751|pmid=24525835|issn=1423-0143}}</ref>  Carnitine has no effect on most parameters in end stage kidney disease, however it possibly has an effect on [[c-reactive protein]].
