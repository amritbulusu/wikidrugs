''[[In vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' data have shown that bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the gut to [[bismuth oxychloride]] and [[salicylic acid]] and less commonly [[bismuth hydroxide]]. In the stomach, this is likely an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The salicylic acid is absorbed and therapeutical concentrations of salicylic acid can be found in blood after bismuth subsalicylate administration. Bismuth oxychloride and bismuth hydroxide are both believed to have bactericidal effects, as is salicylic acid for [[enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterotoxigenic ''E. coli'']] a common cause of "[[traveler's diarrhea]]."<ref name="ReferenceA" />
