'''Pipequaline''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (developmental code name '''PK-8165''') is an [[anxiolytic]] [[drug]] that was never marketed.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J. Elks|title=The Dictionary of Drugs: Chemical Data: Chemical Data, Structures and Bibliographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vXTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA986|date=14 November 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4757-2085-3|pages=986–}}</ref> It possesses a novel [[chemical structure]] that is not closely related to other drugs of this type. The drug has a similar pharmacological profile to the [[benzodiazepine]] family of drugs, but with mainly anxiolytic properties and very little [[sedative]], [[amnestic]] or [[anticonvulsant]] effects, and so is classified as a [[nonbenzodiazepine]] anxiolytic.<ref>von Frenckell R, Ansseau M, Bonnet D.
