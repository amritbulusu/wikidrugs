'''Felypressin''' is a non-[[catecholamine]] [[vasoconstrictor]] that is chemically related to [[vasopressin]], the posterior [[pituitary]] [[hormone]]. It is added to some [[local anaesthetic]]s such as [[prilocaine]] in a concentration of 0.03 IU/ml. Felypressin is a Vasopressin 1 agonist, and will thus have effects at all [[Arginine vasopressin receptor 1A]]s. It will, however, have its main physiological effects on vascular SMC's due to the form in which it is administered.
