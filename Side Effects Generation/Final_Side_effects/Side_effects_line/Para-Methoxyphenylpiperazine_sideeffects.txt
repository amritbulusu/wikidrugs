'''''para''-Methoxyphenylpiperazine''' ('''MeOPP''', '''pMPP''', '''4-MPP'''; '''Paraperazine''') is a [[piperazine]] derivative with [[stimulant]] effects which has been sold as an ingredient in "[[Party pills]]", initially in [[New Zealand]] and subsequently in other countries around the world.

 
MeOPP is anecdotally said to induce significantly less anxiety than similar piperazines, and is usually taken at doses between 120–200&nbsp;mg. It does not produce prominent stimulant effects, but is instead said to be relaxing,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} however it is often mixed with stimulant piperazine derivatives such as [[benzylpiperazine]] (BZP) for a combined effect.

 
MeOPP has been found ''in vitro'' to [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] and induce the [[releasing agent|release]] of the [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s. This is a mechanism of action shared with drugs of abuse such as [[amphetamines]], and MeOPP produces somewhat similar effects although it is much less potent and is thought to have relatively insignificant abuse potential.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nagai | first1 = F | last2 = Nonaka | first2 = R | last3 = Satoh Hisashi | first3 = Kamimura K | year = 2006 | title = The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain | url = | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 559| issue = | pages = 132–137| doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075 | pmid=17223101}}</ref> Piperazine derivatives such as [[trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine]] (TFMPP) have also been shown to exert a major part of their mechanism of action as nonselective [[serotonin receptor agonist]]s, and MeOPP has also been demonstrated to act in this way.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maurer | first1 = HH | last2 = Kraemer | first2 = T | last3 = Springer | first3 = D | last4 = Staack | first4 = RF | date = Apr 2004 | title = Chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and hepatic metabolism of designer drugs of the amphetamine (ecstasy), piperazine, and pyrrolidinophenone types: a synopsis | url = | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 127–31 | doi=10.1097/00007691-200404000-00007 | pmid=15228152}}</ref>
