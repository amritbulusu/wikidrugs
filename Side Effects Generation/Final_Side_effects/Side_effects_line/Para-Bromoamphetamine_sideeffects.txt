'''''para''-Bromoamphetamine''' ('''PBA'''), also known as '''4-bromoamphetamine''' ('''4-BA'''), is an [[amphetamine]] derivative which acts as a [[serotonin]]-[[norepinephrine]]-[[dopamine]] [[releasing agent]] (SNDRA) and produces [[stimulant]] effects.

 
Like most other ''[[Arene substitution patterns|para]]''-[[Substitution reaction|substituted]] [[amphetamine]]s, PBA can be [[neurotoxic]] and may deplete the brain of 5-hydroxyindoles for at least a week.<ref name=haloampcomparison>{{Cite journal | last1 = Fuller | first1 = R.
