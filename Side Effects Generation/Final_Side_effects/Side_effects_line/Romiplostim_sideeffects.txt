==Side-effects==

 
Romiplostim's effect is to stimulate the patient's [[megakaryocyte]]s to produce platelets at a more rapid than normal rate, thus overwhelming the [[immune system]]'s ability to destroy them. As doing so involves changes to the [[bone marrow]] chemistry, a number of potentially serious [[adverse drug reaction|side-effects]] may develop, including death, [[myalgia]], joint and extremity discomfort, [[insomnia]], [[thrombocytosis]], which may lead to potentially fatal [[clot]]s, and [[myelofibrosis|bone marrow fibrosis]], the latter which may result in an [[anemia|unsafe decrease]] in the [[red blood count]].
