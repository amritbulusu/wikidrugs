'''2-Fluoroamphetamine''' ('''2-FA''') is a [[stimulant]] drug from the [[amphetamine]] family which has been sold as a [[designer drug]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rösner | first1 = P | last2 = Quednow | first2 = B | last3 = Girreser | first3 = U | last4 = Junge | first4 = T | title = Isomeric fluoro-methoxy-phenylalkylamines: a new series of controlled-substance analogues (designer drugs) | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 148 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 143–56 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15639609 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.05.003 }}</ref> 2-Fluoroamphetamine differs from [[3-Fluoroamphetamine|3-]] and [[4-Fluoroamphetamine|4-fluoroamphetamine]] in the position of the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring, making them [[positional isomer]]s of one another. The replacement of a hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom in certain compounds to facilitate passage through the [[blood–brain barrier]], as is desirable in [[central nervous system]] pharmaceutical agents, is a common practice due to the corresponding increase in [[lipophilicity]] granted by the substitute.<ref name="smartfluorine">{{cite journal |author=B.E.
