Crohn's patients have flares of their disease between periods of disease quiescence.  Severe flares are usually treated with [[Prednisone|steroid]] medications to obtain remission, but steroids have many undesirable side effects, so some gastroenterologists are now advocating the use of infliximab as the first drug to try to get patients into [[remission (medicine)|remission]].  This has been called the top-down approach to treatment.<!--

 
== Adverse effects ==

 
Infliximab has adverse effects, some life-threatening, common to drugs in the class of [[TNF inhibitor|TNF inhibiting]] [[immunosuppressants]] (which also includes etanercept ([[Enbrel]]) and adalimumab ([[Humira]])). Some of the most severe are:

 
Infliximab neutralizes the biological activity of [[TNF alpha|TNF-α]] by binding with high [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] to the soluble (free floating in the blood) and transmembrane (located on the outer membranes of [[T cells]] and similar immune cells) forms of TNF-α, and inhibits or prevents the effective binding of TNF-α with its receptors. Infliximab and [[adalimumab]] (another TNF antagonist) are in the subclass of "anti-TNF antibodies" (they are in the form of naturally occurring antibodies), and are capable of neutralizing all forms (extracellular-, [[transmembrane]]-, and [[Receptor (immunology)|receptor]]-bound) TNF-α.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Choy EH, Panayi GS | title = Cytokine pathways and joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 344 | issue = 12 | pages = 907–16 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11259725 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200103223441207 }}</ref> Etanercept, a third TNF antagonist, is in a different subclass (receptor-construct fusion protein), and, because of its modified form, cannot neutralize receptor-bound TNF-α.<ref>Etanercept product labeling</ref> Additionally, the anti-TNF antibodies [[adalimumab]] and infliximab have the capability of [[lysing]] cells involved in the inflammatory process, whereas the receptor fusion protein apparently lacks this capability.<ref>Etanercept, Adalimumab and Infliximab product labeling</ref> Although the clinical significance of these differences have not been absolutely proven, [[etanercept]], has been shown to perform worse than placebo for Crohn's disease. These differences may account for the differential actions of these drugs in both efficacy and side effects.
