'''Bucolome''' ('''Paramidine''') is a [[barbiturate]] derivative. Unlike most barbiturates it does not have any significant [[sedative]] or [[hypnotic]] effects, but instead acts as an [[analgesic]] and [[antiinflammatory]]. It also acts as a [[CYP2C9]] inhibitor and reduces the metabolism of several commonly used drugs, which makes it useful for potentiating or extending the duration of action of those drugs, or reducing the production of unwanted metabolites.<ref>Takamura N, Maruyama T, Chosa E, Kawai K, Tsutsumi Y, Uryu Y, Yamasaki K, Deguchi T, Otagiri M.
