Andarine is an orally active [[partial agonist]] for [[androgen receptor]]s. It is less potent in both anabolic and androgenic effects than other SARMs. In an animal model of benign prostatic hypertrophy, andarine was shown to reduce prostate weight with similar efficacy to [[finasteride]], but without producing any reduction in muscle mass or anti-androgenic side effects.<ref>G{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao W, Kearbey JD, Nair VA, Chung K, Parlow AF, Miller DD, Dalton JT | title = Comparison of the pharmacological effects of a novel selective androgen receptor modulator, the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride, and the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide in intact rats: new approach for benign prostate hyperplasia | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 145 | issue = 12 | pages = 5420–8 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15308613 | pmc = 2098692 | doi = 10.1210/en.2004-0627 }}</ref> This suggests that it is able to competitively block binding of [[dihydrotestosterone]] to its receptor targets in the prostate gland, but its partial agonist effects at androgen receptors prevent the side effects associated with the [[Antiandrogen|anti-androgenic]] drugs traditionally used for treatment of BPH.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao W, Kim J, Dalton JT | title = Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nonsteroidal androgen receptor ligands | journal = Pharmaceutical Research | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 1641–58 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16841196 | pmc = 2072875 | doi = 10.1007/s11095-006-9024-3 }}</ref>
