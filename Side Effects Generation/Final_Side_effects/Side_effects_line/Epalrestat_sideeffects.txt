Aldose reductase is the key enzyme in the polyol pathway whose enhanced activity is the basis of diabetic neuropathy. Aldose reductase inhibitors (ARI) target this enzyme. Out of the many ARIs developed, ranirestat and fidarestat are in the trial stage. Others have been discarded due to unacceptable adverse effects or weak efficacy. Epalrestat is the only ARI commercially available.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hotta|first1=N|last2=Akanuma|first2=Y|last3=Kawamori|first3=R|last4=Matsuoka|first4=K|last5=Oka|first5=Y|last6=Shichiri|first6=M|title=Long-Term Clinical Effects of Epalrestat, an|journal=Diabetes Care|date=July 2006|volume=29|issue=7|pages=1538–44|doi=10.2337/dc05-2370|pmid=16801576|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/7/1538.long|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> It is easily absorbed into the neural tissue<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Terashima|first1=H|last2=Hama|first2=K|last3=Yamamoto|first3=R|last4=Tsuboshima|first4=M|last5=Kikkawa|first5=R|last6=Hatanaka|first6=I|title=Effects of a new aldose reductase inhibitor on various tissues in vitro.|journal=J Pharmacol Exp Ther|date=1984|volume=229|pages=226–30}}</ref> and inhibits the enzyme with minimum side effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hotta|first1=N|last2=Sakamoto|first2=N|last3=Shigeta|first3=Y|last4=Kikkawa|first4=G|last5=Goto|first5=Y|last6=Diabetic Neuropathy Study|title=Clinical investigation of epalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor, on diabetic neuropathy in Japan: multicenter study.|journal=J Diabetes Complications|date=1996|volume=10|pages=168–72|doi=10.1016/1056-8727(96)00113-4}}</ref>

 
It has been proven in animal experiments that there is an improvement in sorbitol levels and Na+/K+ ATPase activity leading to improved nerve conduction velocity. Diabetic rats treated with epalrestat showed improvement in morphological abnormalities of nerves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hotta|first1=N|last2=Sugimura|first2=K|last3=Kakuta|first3=H|last4=Fukasawa|first4=H|last5=Kimura|first5=M|last6=Koh|first6=N|title=Effects of a fructose rich diet and an aldose reductase inhibitor on the development of diabetic neuropathy in streptozotocin-treated rats.|date=1988|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers BV|location=Amsterdam|page=511|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> 

 
In a placebo controlled double blind trial of 196 patients, it was proved that Epalrestat in a dose of 150&nbsp;mg/day improved the effects of diabetic neuropathy like upper limb spontaneous pain, motor nerve conduction velocity, thresholds of vibratory sensation and autonomic nerve function as compared to a placebo. These effects were significantly better in those with poorer control of diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goto|first1=Y|last2=Hotta|first2=N|last3=Shigeta|first3=Y|last4=Sakamoto|first4=N|last5=Kikkawa|first5=R|title=Effects of an aldose reductase inhibitor, epalrestat, on diabetic neuropathy.
