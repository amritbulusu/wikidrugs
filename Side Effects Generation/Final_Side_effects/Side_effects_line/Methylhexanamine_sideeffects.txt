Methylhexanamine is an indirect [[sympathomimetic drug]] that [[Vasoconstriction|constricts blood vessels]] and thus has effects on the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs. It also causes [[bronchodilation]], inhibits [[peristalsis]] in the intestines, and has [[diuretic]] effects.<ref name=RegRev>{{cite journal|last=Venhuis|first=Bastiaan J.|author2=De Kaste, Dries|title=Scientific opinion on the regulatory status of 1,3-Dimethylamylamine (DMAA)|journal=European Journal of Food Research & Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 93–100 | year = 2012|url=http://www.sciencedomain.org/abstract.php?iid=155&id=1&aid=703#.UuVae2Qo5GE}}</ref>{{rp|95}} Most studies have been done on pharmacological effects when the drug is inhaled; our understanding of what methylhexanamine does when taken orally are mostly based on extrapolating from the activities of similar compounds.<ref name=RegRev/>{{rp|97}} A 2013 review concluded that: "Pharmacological effects after oral intake can be expected on the lungs (bronchodilation) and the nasal mucosa following a single oral dose of about 4–15&nbsp;mg. Pharmacological effects on the heart can be expected following a single oral dose of about 50–75&nbsp;mg. Pharmacological effects on the blood pressure can be expected after a single oral dose of about 100&nbsp;mg. Because of the long half-life, there is a risk that repeated doses within 24–36 hours could lead to steadily stronger pharmacological effects (build-up)."<ref name=RegRev/>{{rp|98}}
