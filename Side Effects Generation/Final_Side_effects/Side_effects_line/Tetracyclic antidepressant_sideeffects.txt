* [[Loxapine]] (Adasuve, Loxitane) – a [[typical antipsychotic]] that produces amoxapine as a major [[metabolite]] and is said to have antidepressant effects, but it is not usually regarded as a TeCA

 
* [[Mazindol]] (Mazanor, Sanorex) – a [[monoamine reuptake inhibitor]] used as an [[appetite suppressant]] and with potential antidepressant effects, but not classified as a TeCA

 
TeCAs have diverse [[pharmacology]] and differ from TCAs in a number of ways. With the exception of amoxapine, TeCAs do not [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]]. However, aside from mirtazapine, they do inhibit the reuptake of [[norepinephrine]]. TeCAs block the [[serotonin]] [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s similarly to TCAs. Besides mirtazapine, they also block the [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]]. Conversely, whereas TCAs have relatively low [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]], mianserin and mirtazapine potently antagonize this receptor, and this action is thought to be involved in their antidepressant effects. TeCAs block the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]] similarly to the TCAs, but tend to be even stronger [[antihistamine]]s than TCAs. On the other hand, in contrast to almost all TCAs, TeCAs have only low affinity for the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, and for this reason, are associated with few or no [[anticholinergic]] [[side effect]]s. Mianserin and mirtazapine are far less [[toxicity|toxic]] than TCAs in [[overdose]].
