| title = Relationship between the Serotonergic Activity and Reinforcing Effects of a Series of Amphetamine Analogs

 
In animal studies, 4-MA was shown to have the lowest rate of self-administration out of a range of similar drugs tested (the others being [[3-methylamphetamine]], [[4-fluoroamphetamine]], and [[3-fluoroamphetamine]]), likely as a result of having the highest potency for releasing serotonin relative to dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wee | first1 = S | last2 = Anderson | first2 = KG | last3 = Baumann | first3 = MH | last4 = Rothman | first4 = RB | last5 = Blough | first5 = BE | last6 = Woolverton | first6 = WL | title = Relationship between the serotonergic activity and reinforcing effects of a series of amphetamine analogs. | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 313 | issue = 2 | pages = 848–54 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15677348 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.104.080101 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumann | first1 = MH | last2 = Clark | first2 = RD | last3 = Woolverton | first3 = WL | last4 = Wee | first4 = S | last5 = Blough | first5 = BE | last6 = Rothman | first6 = RB. |date=Apr 2011 | title = In vivo effects of amphetamine analogs reveal evidence for serotonergic inhibition of mesolimbic dopamine transmission in the rat | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 337 | issue = 1| pages = 218–25 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.110.176271 | pmid = 21228061 | pmc=3063744}}</ref>
