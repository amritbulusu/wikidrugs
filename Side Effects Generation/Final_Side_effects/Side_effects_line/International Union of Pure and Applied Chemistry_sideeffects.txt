''Metal Speciation and Bioavailability in Aquatic Systems, Series on Analytical and Physical Chemistry of Environmental Systems Vol. 3'' is a book about the effect of [[trace metal]]s on aquatic life.<ref name="Metal Speciation and Bioavailability in Aquatic Systems, Series on Analytical and Physical Chemistry of Environmental Systems Vol. 3 review">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0471958301 Metal Speciation and Bioavailability in Aquatic Systems]. Series on Analytical and Physical Chemistry of Environmental Systems Vol. 3. Review on Amazon. Retrieved 15 April 2010</ref> This book is considered a specialty book for researchers interested in observing the effect of trace metals in the water supply. This book includes techniques to assess how [[bioassays]] can be used to evaluate how an [[organism]] is affected by trace metals. Also, ''Metal Speciation and Bioavailability in Aquatic Systems, Series on Analytical and Physical Chemistry of Environmental Systems Vol. 3'' looks at the limitations of the use of bioassays to observe the effects of trace metals on organisms.
