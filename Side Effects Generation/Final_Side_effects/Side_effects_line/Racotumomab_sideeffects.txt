Racotumomab is an [[anti-idiotypic]] mouse [[monoclonal antibody]] that mimics NGc gangliosides, thus triggering an immune response against the tumor antigen NGcGM3. Therefore, rather than being a passive antibody therapy, Racotumomab acts as a therapeutic vaccine. In melanoma, breast, and lung cancer patients, Racotumomab was able to elicit a specific immune response that recognized and directly killed tumor cells expressing the neoantigen by a mechanism of oncotic necrosis.<ref>Hernández, A.M., Rodríguez, N., González,  J.E., Reyes, E., Rondón, T., Griñán, T., et al. (2011). Anti-NeuGcGM3 antibodies actively elicited by idiotypic vaccination in non-small cell lung cáncer patients induce tumor cell death by an oncosis-like mechanism. J. Immunol. 186, 3735–3744.</ref> The specific expression of NGcGM3 in malignant cells reduces the potential risk of an immune cross-reactivity that could cause serious adverse effects.
