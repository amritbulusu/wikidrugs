Lasmiditan is a [[serotonin receptor agonist]] that, like the unsuccessful [[LY-334,370]], selectively binds to the [[5-HT1F receptor|5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor]] subtype. A number of [[triptan]]s have been shown to act on this subtype as well, but only after their affinity for [[5-HT1B receptor|5-HT<sub>1B</sub>]] and [[5-HT1D receptor|5-HT<sub>1D</sub>]] has been made responsible for their anti-migraine activity. The lack of affinity for these receptors might result in fewer side effects related to [[vasoconstriction]] compared to triptans in susceptible patients, such as those with [[ischemic heart disease]], [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] or after a [[myocardial infarction]],<ref name="Prous" /> although a 1998 review has found such side-effects to rarely occur in patients taking triptans.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dahlöf | first1 = CG | last2 = Mathew | first2 = N | title = Cardiovascular safety of 5HT1B/1D agonists--is there a cause for concern? | journal = Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 539–45 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9827245| doi=10.1046/j.1468-2982.1998.1808539.x}}</ref><ref name="Mutschler" />
