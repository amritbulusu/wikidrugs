===Adverse effects===

 
[[Adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) are rare when it is administered correctly. Most ADRs relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, however [[allergy|allergic]] reactions can rarely occur.

 
Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of ropivacaine mainly result in [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and [[cardiovascular]] effects – CNS effects usually occur at lower [[blood plasma]] concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. CNS effects may include CNS excitation (nervousness, tingling around the mouth, [[tinnitus]], tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, [[seizure]]s followed by depression (drowsiness, loss of consciousness), [[respiratory depression]] and [[apnea]]). Cardiovascular effects include [[hypotension]], [[bradycardia]], [[arrhythmia]]s, and/or [[cardiac arrest]] – some of which may be due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxemia]] secondary to respiratory depression.<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor.
