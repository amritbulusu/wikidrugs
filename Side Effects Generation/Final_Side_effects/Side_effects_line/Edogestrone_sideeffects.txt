'''Edogestrone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (developmental code name '''PH-218'''), or '''edogesterone''', also known as '''17α-acetoxy-3,3-ethylenedioxy-6-methylpregn-5-en-20-one''', is a [[steroid]]al [[progestin]] and [[antiandrogen]] of the [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]] group that was synthesized in 1964 but was never marketed.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.
