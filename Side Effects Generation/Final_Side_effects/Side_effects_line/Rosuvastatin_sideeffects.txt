===Effects on cholesterol levels===

 
The effects of rosuvastatin on LDL cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.<ref name="Jones-2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones PH, Davidson MH, Stein EA, Bays HE, McKenney JM, Miller E, Cain VA, Blasetto JW | title=Comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across doses (STELLAR Trial) | journal=Am J Cardiol | year=2003 | volume=92 | issue=2 | pages=152–60 | pmid=12860216 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(03)00530-7}}</ref>

 
Meta-analysis showed that rosuvastatin is able to modestly increase levels of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL cholesterol]] as well, as with other statins.<ref name=" pmid = 18553127 ">{{cite journal | author = McTaggart F | title = Effects of statins on high-density lipoproteins: a potential contribution to cardiovascular benefit. | journal = Cardiovasc Drugs Ther| volume = 22 | issue = 4|date=Aug 2008 | pmid = 18553127 | pages = 321–38 | doi=10.1007/s10557-008-6113-z | pmc=2493531}}</ref> A 2014 Cochrane review determined there was good evidence for rosuvastatin lowering non-HDL levels linearly with dose.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Lipid-lowering efficacy of rosuvastatin.|date = Nov 2014|journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev.|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010254.pub2|pmid = 25415541|access-date = |volume=11 |pages=CD010254}}</ref>  HDL increases by 7% with no dose effect noted.

 
==Side effects and contraindications==

 
Side effects are uncommon. The following side effects should be reported to the prescribing doctor if they persist or get worse:<ref name=MedLine>{{cite web|title=Rosuvastatin|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a603033.html|work=MedlinePlus|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=1 December 2012|date=15 June 2012}}</ref>

 
The following rare side effects are more serious. Like all statins, rosuvastatin can possibly cause [[myopathy]], [[rhabdomyolysis]]. Stop taking rosuvastatin and contact the prescribing doctor if any of these occur:<ref name=MedLine/><ref name=RxList>{{cite web|title=Crestor|url=http://www.rxlist.com/crestor-drug/consumer-side-effects-precautions.htm|publisher=RxList|accessdate=1 December 2012|date=14 November 2012}}</ref>

 
Putative beneficial effects of rosuvastatin therapy on chronic heart failure may be negated by increases in collagen turnover markers as well as a reduction in plasma [[Coenzyme Q10|coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>]] levels in patients with chronic heart failure.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ashton E, Windebank E, Skiba M, etal |title=Why did high-dose rosuvastatin not improve cardiac remodeling in chronic heart failure?
