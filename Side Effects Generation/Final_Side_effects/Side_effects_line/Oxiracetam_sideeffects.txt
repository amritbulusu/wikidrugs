| title = CNS pharmacology and clinical therapeutic effects of oxiracetam

 
The proven effects of the drug are limited to beneficial effects that lead to higher scores in tests for logical performance, attention, concentration, memory and spatial orientation. These tests were performed on patients with mild to moderate dementia and ADHD, and the doses were 800â€“2400&nbsp;mg orally twice a day for one to six months. Improvement has also been seen in patients with exogenic post-concussion syndrome, organic brain syndromes and other dementias. According to V. Gallai ''et al'', oxiracetam is more effective than piracetam for this purpose.<ref name="Gouliaev"/>
