'''Romifidine''' is a [[medication|drug]] that is used in [[veterinary medicine]] as a sedative mainly in large animals such as horses,<ref>Spadavecchia C, Arendt-Nielsen L, Andersen OK, Spadavecchia L, Schatzmann U.

Romifidine acts as an [[agonist]] at the α<sub>2</sub> [[adrenergic receptor]] subtype. Side effects can include [[bradycardia]] and [[respiratory depression]]. It is often used alongside other sedative or analgesic drugs such as [[ketamine]] or [[butorphanol]].<ref>Corletto F, Raisis AA, Brearley JC.
