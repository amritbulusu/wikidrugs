'''Ciclacillin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''cyclacillin''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), trade names '''Cyclapen''', '''Cyclapen-W''', '''Vastcillin''', and others, is an [[aminopenicillin]] [[antibiotic]]. Its spectrum of activity is similar to that of [[ampicillin]], although it is less susceptible to [[beta-lactamase]]s than ampicillin and has much higher [[bioavailability]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Warren GH |title=Cyclacillin: microbiological and pharmacological properties and use in chemotherapy of infection - a critical appraisal |journal=Chemotherapy |volume=22 |issue=3–4 |pages=154–82 |year=1976 |pmid=773605 |doi= 10.1159/000221924|url=}}</ref> A large [[randomized]], [[double-blind]] [[clinical trial]] published in 1978 also showed that ciclacillin is associated with [[statistical significance|significantly]] fewer and milder [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] than ampicillin;<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gold JA, Hegarty CP, Deitch MW, Walker BR |title=Double-blind clinical trials of oral cyclacillin and ampicillin |journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|Antimicrob Agents Chemother]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=55–8 |date=January 1979 |pmid=371540 |pmc=352600 |doi= 10.1128/aac.15.1.55|url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=371540}}</ref> later studies seemed to confirm this improved tolerability, at least in children.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McLinn SE, Goldberg F, Kramer R, Saltstein E, Bomze JP, Deitch MW |title=Double-blind multicenter comparison of cyclacillin and amoxicillin for the treatment of acute otitis media |journal=J Pediatr |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=617–21 |date=October 1982 |pmid=6750067 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-3476(82)80724-5|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McLinn SE, Kaplan J, West N |title=Multicenter comparison of cyclacillin and amoxicillin in the treatment of acute streptococcal pharyngitis |journal=Clin Ther |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=299–304 |year=1983 |pmid=6342785 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
