'''Pridopidine''' ('''Huntexil''', formerly '''ACR16''', also '''ASP2314''') is an experimental drug candidate belonging to a class of agents known as dopidines, which act as dopaminergic stabilizers in the [[central nervous system]]. These compounds may counteract the effects of excessive or insufficient dopaminergic transmission,<ref name="seeman"/><ref name="rung1"/> and are therefore under investigation for application in neurological and psychiatric disorders characterized by altered dopaminergic transmission, such as [[Huntington's disease]] (HD).

 
Pridopidine is in late-stage development by [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries]] who acquired the rights to the product from its original developer [[NeuroSearch]] in 2012. In April 2010, NeuroSearch announced results from the largest European [[phases of clinical research|phase 3]] study in HD carried out to date (MermaiHD). The MermaiHD study examined the effects of pridopidine in patients with HD and the results showed after six months of treatment, pridopidine improved total motor symptoms, although the primary endpoint of the study was not met. Pridopidine was well tolerated and had an [[adverse event]] profile similar to [[placebo]].<ref name="neuro1"/>

 
Dopidines, a new class of pharmaceutical compounds, act as dopaminergic stabilizers, enhancing or counteracting dopaminergic effects in the central nervous system.<ref name="seeman"/><ref name="rung1"/>  They have a dual [[mechanism of action]], displaying functional [[Receptor antagonist|antagonism]] of subcortical [[dopamine receptor|dopamine type 2 (D<sub>2</sub>) receptors]], as well as strengthening of [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[glutamate]] and dopamine transmission.<ref name="waters"/> Dopidines are, therefore, able to regulate both hypoactive and hyperactive functioning in areas of the brain that receive dopaminergic input (i.e. cortical and subcortical regions). This potential ability to restore the cortical–subcortical circuitry to normal suggests dopidines may have the potential to improve symptoms associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including HD.

 
''[[In vitro]]'' studies demonstrate pridopidine exerts its effects by functional antagonism of D<sub>2</sub> receptors. However, pridopidine possesses a number of characteristics<ref name="seeman"/><ref name="rung1"/><ref name="waters"/><ref name="dyhring"/>   that differentiate it from traditional D<sub>2</sub> [[receptor antagonists]] (agents that block receptor responses).

 
The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of pridopidine on a specific subset of HD motor symptoms defined in the modified motor score (mMS).<ref  name="tedroff"/> The mMS comprises 10 items relating to voluntary motor function from the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score (UHDRS—TMS).<ref  name="tedroff"/> Other study endpoints included the UHDRS—TMS, submotor items, cognitive function, behaviour and symptoms of depression and anxiety.

 
In both studies, the effects on the UHDRS–TMS and the mMS were driven by significant improvements in motor symptoms such as gait and balance, and hand movements, deemed by the authors to be "clinically relevant". However, the magnitude of the improvements was small. Pridopdiine demonstrated a favourable tolerability and safety profile, including no observations of treatment-related disadvantages in terms of worsening of other disease signs or symptoms.<ref name="neuro3"/><ref name="neuro4"/>
