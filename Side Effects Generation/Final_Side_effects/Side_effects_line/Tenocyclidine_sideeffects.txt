TCP acts primarily as an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]] which blocks the activity of the NMDA receptor, however its increased psychostimulant effects compared to PCP suggests it also has relatively greater activity as a [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (DRI). Due to its similarity in effects to PCP, TCP was placed into the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons|Schedule I]] list of illegal drugs in the 1970s, although it was only briefly used in the 1970s and 1980s and is now little known.
