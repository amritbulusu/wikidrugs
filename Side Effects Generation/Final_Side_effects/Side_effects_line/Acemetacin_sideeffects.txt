== Adverse effects ==

 
Common side effects (in about 1–10% of patients) include gastrointestinal problems typical of NSAIDs, such as [[nausea]], diarrhoea, stomach pain, and peptic ulcer; central nervous effects like headache and dizziness; and skin reactions. Gastrointestinal tolerability is better than that of the related drug [[indometacin]]. Severe allergic reactions and haematopoietic disorders occur in fewer than 0.01% of patients.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

 
* other NSAIDs, [[corticosteroid]]s: increased frequency of side effects, especially peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding

 
Acemetacin acts as an inhibitor of [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX), producing the anti-inflammatory and [[analgetic]] (pain relieving) effects. In the body, it is partly metabolized to indometacin, which also acts as a COX inhibitor. The same mechanism is responsible for the [[antipyretic]] and [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] effects, which are however not clinically used, as well as for the typical NSAID adverse effects.<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Dinnendahl">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor1=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U |publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|date=2003|edition=18|volume=1|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

 
An advantage of acemetacin is that it reduces gastric damage as compared to indometacin, possibly because acemetacin has less effect on the increase of [[leukotriene B4]] synthesis and [[tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF) expression, leading to less induction of [[leukocyte]]-endothelial adherence.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17876306|pmc=2078220|year=2007|author1=Chávez-Piña|first1=A.
