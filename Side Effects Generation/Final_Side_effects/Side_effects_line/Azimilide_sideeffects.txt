The action of azimilide is directed to the different currents present in atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. It principally blocks I<sub>Kr</sub>, and I<sub>Ks</sub>, with much weaker effects on I<sub>Na</sub>, I<sub>Ca</sub>, I<sub>NCX</sub> and I<sub>K.Ach</sub>. The I<sub>Kr</sub>(rapid)and I<sub>Ks</sub> (slow) are inward rectifier potassium currents, responsible for repolarizing cardiac myocytes towards the end of the cardiac action potential. A somewhat higher concentration of azimilide is needed to block the  IKs current. Both blockages result in an increase of the QT interval and a prolongation of atrial and ventricular refractory periods.

 
Azimilide has been studied for its anti-arrhythmic effects: its converts and maintains sinus rhythm in patients with atrial arrhythmias; and it reduces the frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillators.  Azimilide's most important adverse effect is [[torsades de pointes]], which is a form of [[ventricular tachycardia]].
