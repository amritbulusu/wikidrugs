'''Tolibut''', also known as '''3-(''p''-tolyl)-4-aminobutyric acid''' (or '''β-(4-methylphenyl)-GABA'''), is [[drug]] that was developed in [[Russia]]. It is an [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[γ-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) (that is, a [[GABA analogue]]) and is the 4-methyl analogue of [[phenibut]], and is also an analogue of [[baclofen]] where the 4-chloro substitution has been replaced with a 4-methyl substition. Tolibut has been described as possessing [[analgesic]], [[tranquilizer|tranquilizing]], and [[neuroprotective]] properties. It is not fully clear as to whether the drug was ever approved or used medically in Russia, though it may have been.<ref name="TyurenkovBorodkina2012">{{cite journal|last1=Tyurenkov|first1=I.
