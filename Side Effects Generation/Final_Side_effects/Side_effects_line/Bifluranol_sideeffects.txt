In spite of the fact that it is widely referred to as an antiandrogen in the literature, bifluranol is actually a pure estrogen and does not significantly bind to the [[androgen receptor]] or directly [[receptor antagonist|antagonize]] the action of [[androgen]]s.<ref name="Dekanski1980" /> It exerts functional antiandrogen effects by binding to and activating the [[estrogen receptor]] in the [[pituitary gland]], consequently suppressing the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (and hence acting as an [[antigonadotropin]]) and thereby reducing [[gonad]]al androgen production and systemic androgen levels.<ref name="Dekanski1980" /> Bifluranol has also been found to act as a [[CYP17A1|17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]], though with less [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]] than [[ketoconazole]], and this action may contribute to its efficacy in benign prostatic hyperplasia by further helping to lower androgen levels.<ref name="BarrieRowlands1989">{{cite journal | first1=S.E. | last1=Barrie | title=Inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase/C17-C20 lyase by bifluranol and its analogues | last2=Rowlands | first2=M.G. | last3=Foster | first3=A.B. | last4=Jarman | first4=M. | journal=Journal of Steroid Biochemistry | year=1989 | volume=33 | issue=6 | pages=1191–1195 | issn=0022-4731 | doi=10.1016/0022-4731(89)90429-9 | pmid=2559252}}</ref><ref name="JarmanJohn Smith1998">{{cite journal | first1=Michael | last1=Jarman | title=Inhibitors of enzymes of androgen biosynthesis: cytochrome P450<sub>17α</sub> and 5α-steroid reductase | last2=John Smith | first2=H. | last3=J.
