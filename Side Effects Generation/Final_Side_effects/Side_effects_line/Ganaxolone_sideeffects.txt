Ganaxolone is being investigated for potential medical use in the treatment of [[epilepsy]]. It is well tolerated in human trials, with the most commonly reported side effects being [[somnolence]] (sleepiness), [[dizziness]], and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name=":7">{{cite journal | vauthors = Monaghan EP, Navalta LA, Shum L, Ashbrook DW, Lee DA | title = Initial human experience with ganaxolone, a neuroactive steroid with antiepileptic activity | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 38 | issue = 9 | pages = 1026–31 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9579942 | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1997.tb01486.x}}</ref> Trials in adults with [[Partial seizure|focal onset seizures]] and in children with [[infantile spasms]] have recently been completed.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nohria V, Giller E | title = Ganaxolone | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–5 | date = Jan 2007 | pmid = 17199022 | doi = 10.1016/j.nurt.2006.11.003 }}</ref><ref name=":5">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pieribone VA, Tsai J, Soufflet C, Rey E, Shaw K, Giller E, Dulac O | title = Clinical evaluation of ganaxolone in pediatric and adolescent patients with refractory epilepsy | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 48 | issue = 10 | pages = 1870–4 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17634060 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01182.x }}</ref> There are ongoing studies in patients with focal onset seizures, [[Epilepsy-intellectual disability in females|PCDH19 pediatric epilepsy]], and behaviors in [[Fragile X syndrome]].<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" />

 
Ganaxolone is thought to modulate both [[synapse|synaptic]] and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to normalize over-excited [[neuron]]s.<ref name=":0" /> Ganaxolone's activation of the extrasynaptic receptor is an additional mechanism that provides stabilizing effects that potentially differentiates it from other drugs that increase GABA signaling.<ref name=":0" />
