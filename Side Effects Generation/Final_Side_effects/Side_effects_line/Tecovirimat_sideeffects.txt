'''Tecovirimat''' ('''ST-246''') is an [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] with activity against [[orthopoxviruses]] such as [[smallpox]] and is currently undergoing clinical trials. It was previously owned by [[Viropharma]] and discovered in collaboration with scientists at [[USAMRIID]].  It is currently owned and is synthesized by [[Siga Technologies]], a drug development company in the [[biodefense]] arena. It works by blocking cellular transmission of the virus, thus preventing the disease. Tecovirimat has been effective in laboratory testing, with no serious side effects reported to date. Despite not yet having FDA approval for medical use, tecovirimat is stockpiled in the US [[Strategic National Stockpile]] as a defense against a smallpox outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004108| pmid = 24789223| title = Are We There Yet?
