Pazinaclone has a very similar pharmacological profile to the [[benzodiazepine]]s including sedative and anxiolytic properties, but with less [[amnestic]] effects,<ref>Wada T, Fukuda N. Effect of a new anxiolytic, DN-2327, on learning and memory in rats. Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior. 1992 Mar;41(3):573-9.</ref> and at low doses it is a relatively selective anxiolytic, with sedative effects only appearing at higher doses.<ref>Suzuki M, Uchiumi M, Murasaki M. A comparative study of the psychological effects of DN-2327, a partial benzodiazepine agonist, and alprazolam. Psychopharmacology. 1995 Oct;121(4):442-50.</ref>

 
Pazinaclone produces its sedative and anxiolytic effects by acting as a [[partial agonist]] at [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] benzodiazepine receptors, although pazinaclone is more subtype-selective than most benzodiazepines.<ref>Atack JR. The benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors as a target for the development of novel anxiolytics. Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs. 2005 May;14(5):601-18.</ref>
