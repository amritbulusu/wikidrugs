In 2015, oxaprozin was one of twenty NSAIDs included in a clinical trial to compare the efficacy of NSAIDs in the short-term treatment of [[ankylosing spondylitis]] (AS). The NSAIDs were compared by completing randomized controlled trials of NSAIDs in patients with active AS. Efficacy reported at 2â€“12 weeks and adverse effects were examined. Efficacy was measured by change in pain score and change in the duration of morning stiffness.  A total of 26 trials with a total of 3410 participants were completed (58% of the trials had fewer than 50 participants). While all 20 NSAIDs were found to reduce more pain than the placebo, 15 were found to be significantly better. In regards to the decrease of morning stiffness and the likelihood of adverse events, there was no significant difference between NSAIDs. It was concluded that [[etoricoxib]] was more effective in reducing pain of AS, however due to small studies and insufficient evidence, no one NSAID could be determined to be the most effective treatment of AS.  After etoricoxib, patients taking oxaprozin experienced the least amount of pain with fewer adverse effects than naproxen.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comparative efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in ankylosing spondylitis: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of clinical trials|last = Wang|first = Runsheng|date = 6 Aug 2015|journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|doi = 10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-207677|pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>
