'''Apimostinel''' (former developmental code name '''NRX-1074''') is a novel [[antidepressant]], acting as a selective [[partial agonist]] of an [[allosteric site]] of the [[glycine]] site of the [[NMDA receptor]] complex, which is under investigation by [[Naurex]] (recently acquired by [[Allergan]] for $560 million in late 2015) for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="MEDRS  review">{{cite journal | author = Hayley S, Litteljohn D | title = Neuroplasticity and the next wave of antidepressant strategies | journal = Front Cell Neurosci | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 218 | date = 2013 | pmid = 24312008 | pmc = 3834236 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2013.00218 | quote = Despite the mounting evidence indicating that ketamine has rapid and robust antidepressant properties (and notwithstanding the earlier mentioned preliminary clinical data indicating that long-term, low-dose ketamine may be both tolerable and effective; e.g., Messer et al., 2010), concerns over ketamine’s psychotomimetic effects have spurred intensive efforts to develop safer and more tolerable glutamate-based antidepressants. At the vanguard of this movement are the “next generation” NMDA receptor antagonists. Included here are the aminoadamantanes, memantine and amantadine (Sani et al., 2012); the NR2B-selective antagonists, traxoprodil (CP-101,606; Preskorn et al., 2008) and MK-0657 (Ibrahim et al., 2012a); and the low-affinity NMDA channel blocker AZD6765 (Zarate et al., 2013). The NMDA receptor glycine-site functional partial agonist, GLYX-13, and its orally bioavailable and presumed more potent analog, NRX-1074, have also garnered the recent attention of researchers and clinicians (Burgdorf et al., 2013; Dolgin, 2013), as have several modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors (e.g., the mGluR7 allosteric agonist AMN082; Bradley et al., 2012) and select α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor potentiators (e.g., Org 26576; Nations et al., 2012).}}</ref><ref name="PRNewswire2010">{{cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/naurexs-novel-antidepressant-glyx-13-recognized-as-one-of-windhovers-top-10-neuroscience-projects-to-watch-101866728.html | author = PR Newswire | title = Naurex's Novel Antidepressant GLYX-13 Recognized as One of Windhover's Top 10 Neuroscience Projects to Watch | year = 2010}}</ref><ref name="PRNewswire2014">{{cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/naurex-reports-positive-top-line-phase-2b-results-for-novel-antidepressant-glyx-13-and-advances-nrx-1074-into-phase-2-depression-study-258089291.html | author = PR Newswire | title = Naurex Reports Positive Top-Line Phase 2b Results for Novel Antidepressant GLYX-13 and Advances NRX-1074 into Phase 2 Depression Study | year = 2014}}</ref><ref name="pmid24410564">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dang YH, Ma XC, Zhang JC, etal | title = Targeting of NMDA Receptors in the Treatment of Major Depression | journal = Curr.

Its [[mechanism of action]] and effects are similar to those of [[rapastinel]] (GLYX-13), which is under development as an [[adjunctive therapy]] for [[treatment-resistant depression]] also by Naurex. However, apimostinel is 100-fold more potent by weight and, whereas rapastinel must be administered via [[intravenous injection]], is orally-active.<ref name="PRNewswire2014" /> Apimostinel is intended by Naurex as an improved, follow-up drug to rapastinel. Similarly to rapastinel, apimostinel is an [[amide|amidated]] [[tetrapeptide]], and has almost an identical [[chemical structure]] to rapastinel, but has been [[molecular modification|structurally modified]] via the addition of a [[benzyl group]]. The drug has shown rapid [[antidepressant]] effects in [[animal model|pre-clinical model]]s of [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="PRNewswire2014" /> In addition, similarly to rapastinel, it is well-tolerated and lacks the [[schizophrenia]]-like [[psychotomimetic]] effects of other [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s such as [[ketamine]].<ref name="PRNewswire2014" />
