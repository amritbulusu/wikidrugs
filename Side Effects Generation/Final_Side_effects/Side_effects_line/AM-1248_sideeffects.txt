'''AM-1248''' is a drug that acts as a moderately potent [[agonist]] for both the [[cannabinoid receptor]]s [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cannabinoid receptor 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]], but with some dispute between sources over its exact potency and selectivity.<!-- although note Ki values often cannot be compared directly between literature sources if the assay conditions are different --> Replacing the 3-(1-naphthoyl) group found in many indole derived cannabinoid ligands, with an [[adamantane|adamant]][[ketone|oyl]] group, generally confers significant CB<sub>2</sub> selectivity,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Frost |first1= J.
