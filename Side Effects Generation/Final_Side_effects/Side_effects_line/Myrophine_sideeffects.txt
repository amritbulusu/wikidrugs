Myrophine is substituted with a 3-[[benzyl]] group and a 6-[[Myristic acid|myristyl]] chain. It is metabolised to form [[benzylmorphine]] and then further to morphine, and so is a long-acting [[prodrug]] for morphine, but with a slow onset of effects. It is weaker than morphine as an [[analgesic]] but longer-lasting in effects, and was thought to have more [[local anesthetic]] effect than morphine, though with a somewhat greater tendency to cause [[histamine]] reactions like itching and rash. In addiction studies conducted in human subjects in the 1950's, myrophine did not substitute for morphine in withdrawal, did not produce notable morphine-like effects, and did not produce addiction or dependence regardless of dose or how it was administered. Consequently, it was thought to be useful in treating pain in addicts who were being detoxified from other opioid drugs.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1957/Vol17/Vol17-No4-5/bulletin_1957_17%284-5%29_569-863.pdf Eddy NB, Halbach H, Braenden OJ.
