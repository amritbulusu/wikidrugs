'''Azaperone''' is a [[pyridinylpiperazine]] and [[butyrophenone]] [[neuroleptic]] [[drug]] with [[sedative]] and [[antiemetic]] effects, which is used mainly as a [[tranquilizer]] in [[veterinary]] medicine. It is uncommonly used in humans as an [[antipsychotic]] drug. 

 
Azaperone acts primarily as a [[dopamine]] [[antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonist]] but also has some [[histamine|antihistaminic]] and [[choline|anticholinergic]] properties as seen with similar drugs such as [[haloperidol]]. Azaperone may cause [[hypotension]] and while it has minimal effects on respiration in pigs, high doses in humans can cause [[respiratory depression]].
