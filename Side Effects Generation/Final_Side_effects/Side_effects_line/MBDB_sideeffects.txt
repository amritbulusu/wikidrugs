MBDB was first synthesized by [[pharmacologist]] and [[medicinal chemist]] [[David E. Nichols]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and later tested by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and described in his book, ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story]]''. MBDB's dosage, according to ''PiHKAL'', is 180–210&nbsp;mg; the proper dosage relative to body mass seems unknown. Its duration is 4–6 hours, with noticeable after-effects lasting for 1–3 hours.

 
MBDB was initially developed as a non-psychedelic entactogen. It has lower effects on the [[dopamine]] system in comparison to other entactogens such as [[MDMA]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} MBDB causes many mild, MDMA-like effects, such as lowering of social barriers and inhibitions, pronounced sense of [[empathy]] and [[compassion]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] lift, and mild [[euphoria]] are all present.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} MBDB tends to produce less euphoria, psychedelia, and stimulation in comparison.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

 
:''Although MBDB is both structurally and pharmacologically similar to MDMA, the limited available data indicate that its stimulant and euphoriant effects are less pronounced than those of MDMA. There have been no reports of adverse or toxic effects of MBDB in humans. Law enforcement data on illicit trafficking of MBDB in Europe suggest that its availability and abuse may now be declining after reaching a peak during the latter half of the 1990s. For these reasons, the Committee did not consider the abuse liability of MBDB would constitute a significant risk to public health, thereby warranting its placement under international control. Scheduling of MBDB was therefore not recommended.''
