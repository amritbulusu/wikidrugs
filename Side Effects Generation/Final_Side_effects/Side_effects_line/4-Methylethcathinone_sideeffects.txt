4-MEC is a synthetic stimulant with empathogenic effects that is chemically similar to [[methcathinone]]. It became available online in 2010 and has been sold as replacement for 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone). It has an extremely short history of human use. As of 2011, it is most often found as a powder (either represented as 4-methylethcathinone or included in powder products that don't specify their active ingredients) and has appeared in some samples of "NRG-2", although it has also been found in tablet form.

 
Some users have injected the drug intravenously. This requires heating the water/4-MEC solution in order for 4-MEC to dissolve. Injecting 4-MEC appears to be rough on veins and is sometimes accompanied by a burning sensation; for this reason 4-MEC should be diluted as much as possible. Intravenous dosages are comparable to oral ones, although more care should be given to safety (with regard to possibility of overdose and long-term effects).<ref name="pmid20687197">{{ cite journal |author1=Brandt, S.
