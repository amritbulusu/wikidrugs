'''AB-CHMINACA''' is an [[indazole]]-based [[synthetic cannabinoid]]. It is a potent [[agonist]] of the [[CB1 receptor|CB<sub>1</sub> receptor]] (''K''<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.78&nbsp;nM) and [[CB2 receptor|CB<sub>2</sub> receptor]] (''K''<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.45&nbsp;nM) and fully substitutes for [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC]] in rat discrimination studies, while being 16x more potent.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2015/06/23/jpet.115.225326.short | title=AB-CHMINACA, AB-PINACA, and FUBIMINA: Affinity and Potency of Novel Synthetic Cannabinoids in Producing Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-Like Effects in Mice | author=Jenny L Wiley | author10=Brian F Thomas | date=September 2015 | author2=Julie A Marusich | author3=Timothy W Lefever | author4=Kateland R Antonazzo | author5=Michael T Wallgren | author6=Ricardo A Cortes | author7=Purvi R Patel | author8=Megan Grabenauer | author9=Katherine N Moore | journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | doi=10.1124/jpet.115.225326 | last-author-amp=yes | volume=354 | issue=3 | pages=328–339 | pmc=4538877 | pmid=26105953}}</ref><ref>[https://www.caymanchem.com/app/template/Product.vm/catalog/15434 AB-CHMINACA], Cayman Chemicals</ref> Continuing the trend seen in other cannabinoids of this generation, it contains a [[valine]] amino acid amide residue as part of its structure, where older cannabinoids contained a [[naphthyl]] or [[adamantane]] residue.
