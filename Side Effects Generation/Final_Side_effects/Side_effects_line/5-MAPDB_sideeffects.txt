'''5-MAPDB''' ('''1-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-2-amine''') is a chemical compound which might be an [[entactogenic]] drug. It is structurally related to drugs like [[5-APDB]] and [[5-MAPB]], which have similar effects to MDMA and have been used as recreational drugs. 5-MAPDB has been studied to determine its pharmacological activity, and was found to be a relatively [[selective serotonin releaser]], though with weaker actions as a releaser of other monoamines and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor family agonist,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rickli | first1 = A | last2 = Kopf | first2 = S | last3 = Hoener | first3 = MC | last4 = Liechti | first4 = ME | date = Jul 2015 | title = Pharmacological profile of novel psychoactive benzofurans | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 172 | issue = 13| pages = 3412–25 | doi = 10.1111/bph.13128 | pmid = 25765500 | pmc=4500375}}</ref> similar to older compounds such as [[5-APDB]].<ref name="pmid8246240">{{cite journal | author = Monte AP | author2 = Marona-Lewicka D | author3 = Cozzi NV | author4 = Nichols DE | title = Synthesis and pharmacological examination of benzofuran, indan, and tetralin analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 23 | pages = 3700–6 |date=November 1993 | pmid = 8246240 | doi = 10.1021/jm00075a027| url = }}</ref>

 
5-MAPDB was banned in the UK in June 2013 as a [[temporary class drug]] along with 9 other related compounds, despite having never been sold as a street drug itself. This was due to concerns that it would have similar effects to drugs such as 5-APB that had been widely sold already, and 5-MAPDB might therefore be likely to become used recreationally also, if it were not banned preemptively.<ref name='ACMD report'>{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title = Temporary class drug order report on 5-6APB and NBOMe compounds | accessdate = 2013-07-11 | date = 4 Jun 2013 | publisher = UK Home Office}}</ref>
