Malathion is of low toxicity; however, absorption or ingestion into the human body readily results in its metabolism to [[malaoxon]], which is substantially more toxic.<ref name=REL/>  In studies of the effects of long-term exposure to oral ingestion of malaoxon in rats, malaoxon has been shown to be 61 times more toxic than malathion.<ref name=REL>{{cite journal |url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/REDs/malathion_red.pdf |title=Reregistration  Eligibility Decision for Malathion |journal=US Environmental Protection Agency - Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances EPA 738-R-06-030   journal |author=Edwards D  |pages=9 |year=2006}}</ref>  It is cleared from the body quickly, in three to five days.<ref name="Maugh II">{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/16/science/la-sci-pesticides-20100517 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Thomas H. | last=Maugh II | title=Study links pesticide to ADHD in children | date=16 May 2010}}</ref>  

 
According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] there is currently no reliable information on adverse health effects of chronic exposure to malathion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg154.html |title=US Department of Health and Human Services: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry - Medical Management Guidelines for Malathion |accessdate=2008-04-02 |work=}}</ref> Acute exposure to extremely high levels of malathion will cause body-wide symptoms whose intensity will be dependent on the severity of exposure. Symptoms include skin and eye irritation, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, excessive sweating, seizures and even death. Most symptoms tend to resolve within several weeks.  Malathion present in untreated water is converted to malaoxon during the chlorination phase of water treatment, so malathion should not be used in waters that may be used as a source for drinking water, or any upstream waters.
