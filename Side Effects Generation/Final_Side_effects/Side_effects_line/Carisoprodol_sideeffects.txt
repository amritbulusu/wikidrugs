'''Carisoprodol''', marketed under the brand name '''Soma''' among others, is a prescription drug marketed since 1959. It is a centrally acting skeletal [[muscle relaxant]] of the [[carbamate]] class and produces all the effects associated with [[barbiturate]]s. It is a [[prodrug]]<ref>Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Somerset, New Jersey is the U.S. subsidiary of Meda AB of Solna, Sweden {{Cite web |url = http://www.medpointepharma.com/index.html/ |title = Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. |accessdate = 22 June 2010 }}</ref> and is both [[Structural analog|structurally]] and [[pharmacologically]] related to [[meprobamate]]. The major metabolic pathway of carisoprodol involves its conversion to meprobamate.<ref name="accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |title = SOMA® COMPOUND |url = https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/012365s038lbl.pdf |website = accessdata.fda.gov |publisher = Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. |accessdate = 16 April 2017 |pages = 5–17 |date = October 2009 }}</ref>

 
== Side effects ==

 
The usual dose of 350&nbsp;mg is unlikely to engender prominent side effects other than [[somnolence]], and mild to significant [[euphoria]] or [[dysphoria]], but the euphoria is generally short lived. The medication is well tolerated and without adverse effects in the majority of patients for whom it is indicated. In some patients, however, and/or early in therapy, carisoprodol can have the full spectrum of sedative side effects and can impair the patient's ability to operate a firearm, motor vehicles, and other machinery of various types, especially when taken with medications containing alcohol, in which case an alternative medication would be considered. The intensity of the side effects of carisoprodol tends to lessen as therapy continues, as is the case with many other drugs.

 
Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid for elderly people.<ref>[http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf NCQA’s HEDIS Measure: Use of High Risk Medications in the Elderly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201113909/http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |date=1 February 2010 }}</ref>

 
Psychological dependence has also been linked to carisoprodol use although this is much less severe than with meprobamate itself (presumably due to the slower onset of effects). Psychological dependence is more common in those who abuse carisoprodol and those who have a history of drug abuse (particularly sedatives and/or alcohol). It may reach clinical significance before physiological tolerance and dependence have occurred and (as with benzodiazepines) has been demonstrated to persist to varying degrees of severity for months or years after discontinuation.

 
Discontinuation of carisoprodol, as with all GABA-ergics, can result in persistent cognitive changes which persist for weeks, months, or – rarely – even years including greatly increased anxiety and depression, [[social withdrawal]], hair-trigger agitation/aggression, chronic [[insomnia]], new or aggravated (often illogical) [[phobias]], reduced IQ, short term and long term memory loss, and dozens of other sequelae.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Persistence of cognitive effects after withdrawal from long-term Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology |author1 = Melinda J Barker |author2 = Kenneth M Greenwood |author3 = Martin Jackson |author4 = Simon F Crowe |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887617703000969 |doi = 10.1016/S0887-6177(03)00096-9 |volume = 19 |issue = 3 |journal = Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology |pages = 437–454 |pmid = 15033227 |date = April 2004 }}</ref> The effects, severity, and duration appear to be slightly dose-dependent but are mainly determined by the patients pattern of use (taken as prescribed, taken in bulk doses, mixed with other drugs, a combination of the above, etc.), genetic predisposition to drug abuse, and a history of substance abuse all increase the patients risk of persistent discontinuation syndrome symptoms.

 
Recreational users of carisoprodol usually seek its potentially heavy sedating, relaxant, and [[anxiolytic]] effects.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate = 29 April 2011 |url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/carisoprodol.htm |title = DEA Drugs & Chemicals of Concern "Carisoprodol" |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110417095759/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/carisoprodol.htm |archivedate = 17 April 2011 |df = }}</ref> Also, because of its potentiating effects on [[narcotic]]s, it is often abused in conjunction with many [[opioid]] drugs. Also it is not detected on standard [[drug test]]ing screens.

Carisoprodol produces the same enzyme-inducing effects as barbiturates and may be used to potentiate pro-drug opioids, most commonly codeine and hydrocodone, by increasing the amount of pro-drug converted into the active metabolites (morphine and hydromorphone, respectively). This mechanism, in conjunction with the combined euphoria, sedation, and anxiolytic effects of the two drugs makes the practice incredibly dangerous and unintentional overdoses are not uncommon. The combination of hydrocodone and carisoprodol is referred to in some harm-reduction forums as a "Las Vegas cocktail".<ref name="narconon.org">{{cite web |title = Effects of Soma Abuse |url = http://www.narconon.org/drug-abuse/soma-effects.html |website = narconon.org |accessdate = 16 April 2017 }}</ref> Many overdoses have resulted from recreational users combining these drugs to combine their individual effects without being aware of the enzyme-induction induced potentiation.{{mcn|date=July 2015}}

 
Carisoprodol has a rapid, 30-minute onset of action, with the aforementioned effects lasting about two to six hours. It is metabolized in the liver via the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]] [[isozyme]] [[CYP2C19]], excreted by the kidneys and has about an eight-hour half-life. A considerable proportion of carisoprodol is metabolized to [[meprobamate]], which is a known drug of abuse and dependence; this could account for the abuse potential of carisoprodol (meprobamate levels reach higher peak plasma levels than carisoprodol itself following administration). Meprobamate is believed to play a significant role in the effects of carisoprodol and meprobamates long half-life results in bioaccumulation following extended periods of carisoprodol administration.

 
As of November 2007, carisoprodol (Somadril, Somadril comp.) has been taken off the market in Sweden due to problems with dependence and side effects. The agency overseeing pharmaceuticals considered other drugs used with the same indications as carisoprodol to have the same or better effects without the risks of the drug.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate = 9 May 2009 |url = http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/Tpl/NewsPage____6712.aspx |title = Marknadsföringen av Somadril och Somadril comp rekommenderas upphöra tillfälligt |date = 16 November 2007 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

 
* In September 2013, carisoprodol has been taken off the market in Indonesia due to problems with diversion, dependence and side effects.
