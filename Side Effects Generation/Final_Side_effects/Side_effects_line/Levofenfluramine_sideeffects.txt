[[Levonorfenfluramine]], an active metabolite of levofenfluramine, is also a fairly potent serotonin releasing agent (with a potency of approximately 1/2 that of norfenfluramine and 1/6th that of dexfenfluramine) and, similarly to dexnorfenfluramine, is a 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonist, as well as a somewhat less potent [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (about 1/2 that of its efficacy as a serotonin releaser).<ref name="pmid11104741" /><ref name="pmid11888573" /><ref name="pmid17017961" /> As such, likely contributes significantly to the [[biological activity]]—though not necessarily appetite suppressant effects—of not only levofenfluramine but of racemic fenfluramine as well. In contrast to levonorfenfluramine, levofenfluramine is virtually inactive as a reuptake inhibitor or releaser of [[norepinephrine]],<ref name="pmid17017961" /> and neither compound has any effect on [[dopamine]] reuptake or release.<ref name="pmid17017961" />
