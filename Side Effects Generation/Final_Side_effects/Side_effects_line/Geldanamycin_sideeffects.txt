This effect is mediated via HSP90. Despite its potent antitumor potential, geldanamycin presents several major drawbacks as a drug candidate such as [[hepatotoxicity]], further, Jilani ''et al''. reported that geldanamycin induces the [[apoptosis]] of [[erythrocytes]] under physiological concentrations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = | first1 = | last2 = | first2 = | year = 2013 | title = Geldanamycin-Induced Phosphatidylserine Translocation in the Erythrocyte Membrane | journal = Cell Physiol Biochem | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 1600â€“1609 | publisher = | jstor = | doi = 10.1159/000356596 | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356596 | format = | accessdate = }}</ref> These side effects have led to the development of geldanamycin analogues, in particular analogues containing a derivatisation at the 17 position:
