JDTic is a long-acting ("inactivating") [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the KOR, and is highly selective for the KOR over the [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptor]] (MOR), [[delta opioid receptor|δ-opioid receptor]] (DOR), and [[nociceptin receptor]] (NOP).<ref name="pmid11495579" /><ref name="pmid25635572" /> It has a very long duration of action, with effects in animals seen for up to several weeks after administration of a single dose,<ref>{{ cite journal |vauthors=Carroll FI, Thomas JB, Dykstra LA, Granger AL, Allen RM, Howard JL, Pollard GT, Aceto MD, Harris LS | title = Pharmacological Properties of JDTic: A Novel κ-Opioid Receptor Antagonist | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | year = 2004 | volume = 501 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 111–119 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.08.028 | pmid = 15464069 }}</ref> although its binding to the KOR is not technically "irreversible" and its long-acting effects are instead caused by altered activity of [[c-Jun N-terminal kinases]].<ref>{{ cite journal |vauthors=Bruchas MR, Yang T, Schreiber S, Defino M, Kwan SC, Li S, Chavkin C | title = Long-Acting κ Opioid Antagonists Disrupt Receptor Signaling and Produce Noncompetitive Effects by Activating c-Jun N-terminal Kinase | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | year = 2007 | volume = 282 | issue = 41 | pages = 29803–29811 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M705540200 | pmid = 17702750 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/282/41/29803.full.pdf | format = pdf | pmc=2096775}}</ref>
