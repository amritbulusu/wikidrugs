'''MDAI''' ('''5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane''') is a [[drug]] developed in the 1990s by a team led by [[David E. Nichols]] at [[Purdue University]]. It acts as a non-[[neurotoxic]] and highly [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[selective serotonin releasing agent|serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA) ''[[in vitro]]'' and produces [[entactogen]] effects in humans.

 
=== Effects ===

 
The family of drugs typified by [[MDMA]] produce their effects through multiple mechanisms of action in the body, and consequently produce three distinct cues which animals can be trained to respond to: a stimulant cue typified by drugs such as [[methamphetamine]], a psychedelic cue typified by drugs such as [[LSD]] and [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]], and an "entactogen-like" cue which is produced by drugs such as MDAI and [[MBDB]]. These drugs cause drug-appropriate responses in animals trained to recognize the effects of MDMA, but do not produce responses in animals trained selectively to respond to stimulants or hallucinogens. Because these compounds selectively release serotonin in the brain but have little effect on dopamine or noradrenaline levels, they can produce empathogenic effects but without any stimulant action, instead being somewhat sedating.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 2886126|year = 1987|author1 = Steele|first1 = T.

MDAI and other similar drugs have been widely used in scientific research, as they are able to replicate many of the effects of MDMA, but without causing the [[neurotoxicity]] which may be associated with MDMA and some related drugs. No tests have been performed on cardiovascular toxicity.<ref name="nichols MDAI"/><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 1826785 | volume=38 | title=5-Iodo-2-aminoindan, a nonneurotoxic analogue of p-iodoamphetamine | date=January 1991 | journal=Pharmacol.
