'''Velneperit''' ('''S-2367''') is a drug developed by [[Shionogi]], which acts as a potent and selective [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] for the [[Neuropeptide Y]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[Neuropeptide Y receptor Y5|Y<sub>5</sub>]]. It has [[anorectic]] effects and was developed as a possible treatment for [[obesity]], but was discontinued from further development after disappointing results in Phase II clinical trials. However it was still considered a successful proof of concept of the potential of Y<sub>5</sub> receptor antagonists as possible anti-obesity agents in future.<ref>Yukioka H.
