One of Richardson-Merrell's best-known incidents revolved around its efforts to introduce [[thalidomide]] into the US market in the 1950s and 1960s under the brand name "Kevadon". The drug was already highly popular in Europe as a [[sedative]] and [[antiemetic]] for elderly patients. Although neither tested nor approved for use during pregnancy, its effectiveness and absence of significant side-effects led many physicians to prescribe it to pregnant women.  Richardson-Merrell submitted their [[new drug application]] (NDA) to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in June, 1960. During the application process, Richardson-Merrell asked the FDA for quick approval of the drug, and distributed 2.5 million tablets of thalidomide to 1,200 American doctors with the understanding that the drug was under investigation, a preemptive marketing strategy that was permissible at the time under existing regulations.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web |title=About the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm091393.htm |date=2009-06-18 |work=[[US Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> Nearly 20,000 patients received the drug. Reviewing [[pharmacologist]] [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], who had joined the FDA just a month before the application's arrival, repeatedly denied the company's requests for permission to market the drug, citing an insufficient number of controlled studies to establish risks.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bren, Linda |title=Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History |url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html  |date=Marchâ€“April 2001 |work=[[US Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=27 July 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113102840/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html |archivedate = 13 January 2008}}</ref> When studies revealed that 10,000 children worldwide had been born with severe birth defects from the drug, Merrell withdrew its application and recalled the remaining unconsumed tablets from doctors offices around the country. Ultimately, 17 children in the United States were born with defects. For correctly denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>[http://www.medic8.com/medicines/Thalidomide.html Thalidomide - medic8.com - Retrieved August 25, 2008]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
