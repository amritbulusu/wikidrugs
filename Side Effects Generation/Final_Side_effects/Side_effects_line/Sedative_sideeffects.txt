At higher doses it may result in slurred speech, staggering [[gait (human)|gait]], poor judgment, and slow, uncertain [[reflex]]es. Doses of sedatives such as [[benzodiazepines]], when used as a [[hypnotic]] to induce [[sleep]], tend to be higher than amounts used to relieve anxiety, whereas only low doses are needed to provide a peaceful effect.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Montenegro M, Veiga H, Deslandes A, etal |title=[Neuromodulatory effects of caffeine and bromazepam on visual event-related potential (P300): a comparative study.] |journal=Arq Neuropsiquiatr |volume=63 |issue=2B |pages=410–5 |date=June 2005 |pmid=16059590 |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2005000300009  |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-282X2005000300009&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en }}</ref>

 
Advances in pharmacology have permitted more specific targeting of receptors, and greater selectivity of agents, which necessitates greater precision when describing these agents and their effects:

 
There are also serious [[paradoxical reactions]] that may occur in conjunction with the use of sedatives that lead to unexpected results in some individuals.  Malcolm Lader at the Institute of Psychiatry in London estimates the incidence of these adverse reactions at about 5%, even in short-term use of the drugs.   The paradoxical reactions may consist of [[depression (mood)|depression]], with or without suicidal tendencies, [[phobias]], aggressiveness, [[violent]] behavior and symptoms sometimes misdiagnosed as [[psychosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/paradox.htm|title=benzo.org.uk - Benzodiazepines: Paradoxical Reactions and Long-Term Side-Effects|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>

 
The long-term use of benzodiazepines may have a similar effect on the brain as [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and are also implicated in [[Mood disorder#Substance-induced|depression]], [[Anxiety#Substance-induced|anxiety]], posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mania, psychosis, [[Insomnia#Substance-induced Sleep Disorder|sleep disorders]], sexual dysfunction, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders (including benzodiazepine-induced persisting dementia which persists even after the medications are stopped).<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition|last = American Psychiatric Association|first = |publisher = American Psychiatric Association|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Arlington, VA|pages = }}</ref> As with alcohol, the effects of benzodiazepine on neurochemistry, such as decreased levels of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]], are believed to be responsible for their effects on mood and anxiety.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Collier|first1 = Judith|last2 = Longmore|first2 = Murray|editor1-first = Peter|editor1-last = Scally|title = Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialties|edition = 6|year = 2003|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0-19-852518-9|page = 366|chapter = 4}}</ref><ref name="ashman">{{cite web |author = Professor Heather Ashton|year = 2002|url = http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha03.htm|title = Benzodiazepines: How They Work and How to Withdraw}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lydiard RB, Laraia MT, Ballenger JC, Howell EF |title = Emergence of depressive symptoms in patients receiving alprazolam for panic disorder|journal = Am J Psychiatry|volume = 144|issue = 5|pages = 664–5|date = May 1987|pmid = 3578580|doi = 10.1176/ajp.144.5.664|url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3578580|ref = harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Nathan RG, Robinson D, Cherek DR, Davison S, Sebastian S, Hack M|date = 1 January 1985|title = Long-term benzodiazepine use and depression|journal = Am J Psychiatry|volume = 142|issue = 1|pages = 144–5|publisher = American Journal of Psychiatry|pmid = 2857068|url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/142/1/144a|ref = harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Addiction: Part I.

[[Lorazepam]] is one such pharmacological agent that can cause [[anterograde amnesia]].  [[Intensive care unit]] patients who receive higher doses over longer periods, typically via [[Intravenous therapy|IV drip]], are more likely to experience such side effects.
