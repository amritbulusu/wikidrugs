'''DiPT''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|p|t|iː}} or '''''N,N''-diisopropyltryptamine''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ˌ|aɪ|s|oʊ-|ˌ|p|r|oʊ|p|ᵻ|l|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|p|t|əm|iː|n}} is a [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drug]] of the [[tryptamine]] family that has a unique effect. While the majority of hallucinogens affect the visual sense, DiPT is primarily aural. It has been suggested that DiPT may have value to researchers of [[neurology]] due to its complex audio distorting effects.

 
===General effects===

 
Although DiPT's effects are primarily aural, some users have reported that at higher doses they noticed a lack of coordination or balance, confusion, and some users have reported minor visual distortions. Aside from these, the most prevalent non-auditory effect is inner ear pressure (which has been painful in some instances, for example when combined with MDMA).  Unlike other psychedelics, users' [[set and setting]] doesn't seem to influence what is experienced. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
