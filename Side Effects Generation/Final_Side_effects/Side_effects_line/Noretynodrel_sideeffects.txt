Whereas norethisterone has virtually no affinity for the [[estrogen receptor]]s (ERs), noretynodrel shows some, albeit very weak affinity for both the [[ERα]] and the [[ERβ]] (in terms of [[relative binding affinity]], 0.7% and 0.22% of that of [[estradiol]], respectively).<ref name="pmid12475720" /><ref name="pmid9048584">{{cite journal |vauthors = Kuiper GG, Carlsson B, Grandien K, Enmark E, Häggblad J, Nilsson S, Gustafsson JA |title= Comparison of the ligand binding specificity and transcript tissue distribution of estrogen receptors alpha and beta |journal= Endocrinology |volume= 138 |issue= 3 |pages= 863–70 |year= 1997 |pmid= 9048584 |doi= 10.1210/endo.138.3.4979 |url= }}</ref> The estrogenic activity of 3α- and 3β-hydroxynoretynodrel has never been assessed.<ref name="pmid22210085" /> However, while tibolone shows similar affinity for the ERs as noretynodrel, the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone have several-fold increased affinity for the ERs.<ref name="pmid22210085" /><ref name="pmid12475720" /> As such, the 3α- and 3β-hydroxylated metabolites of noretynodrel may also show increased estrogenic activity, and this may account for the known estrogenic effects of noretynodrel.<ref name="pmid22210085" /><ref name="pmid12475720" /> The Δ<sup>4</sup>-isomer of tibolone, similarly to norethisterone, is virtually devoid of affinity for the ERs.<ref name="pmid12475720" /> Neither tibolone nor its metabolites are aromatized, whereas trestolone is readily aromatized similarly to testosterone and 19-nortestosterone, and for these reasons, it is unlikely that noretynodrel or its metabolites are aromatized either.<ref name="de GooyerOppers-Tiemissen2003">{{cite journal |last1=de Gooyer|first1=Marcel E. |last2= Oppers-Tiemissen|first2=Hendrika M. |last3= Leysen |first3=Dirk |last4=Verheul |first4=Herman A.M. |last5= Kloosterboer |first5= Helenius J. |title= Tibolone is not converted by human aromatase to 7α-methyl-17α-ethynylestradiol (7α-MEE): |journal= Steroids |volume=68 |issue=3 |year=2003 |pages= 235–243 |issn= 0039-128X |doi= 10.1016/S0039-128X(02)00184-8 }}</ref> As such, aromatization likely does not play a role in the estrogenic activity of tibolone or noretynodrel.<ref name="de GooyerOppers-Tiemissen2003" /> However, controversy on this matter exists, and other researchers have suggested that tibolone and noretynodrel may be aromatized in small amounts to highly potent estrogens ([[ethinylestradiol]] and its 7α-methyl derivative, respectively).<ref name="KuhlWiegratz2009">{{cite journal |last1=Kuhl |first1=H. |last2= Wiegratz |first2=I. |title= Can 19-nortestosterone derivatives be aromatized in the liver of adult humans?
