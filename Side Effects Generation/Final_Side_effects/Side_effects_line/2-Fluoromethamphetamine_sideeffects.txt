It is often compared by its users in anecdotal reports to [[Lisdexamfetamine]] (Vyvanse) in regards to 2-FMA's dosage, duration, and general effects profile. What is unique to 2-FMA is that even though it is chemically related to [[Methamphetamine]], it does not share the same effects profile and is more comparable to [[Dextroamphetamine]] or Lisdexamfetamine <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=104939|title=Erowid Experience Vaults: 2-Fluoromethamphetamine (2-FMA)  - A Clean Productivity Stimulant - 104939|website=www.erowid.org|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref>. Compared against most pharmaceutical amphetamine formulations, it produces noticeably fewer physical side-effects, such as minimal nausea, negligible effects on anxiety, and lack of uncomfortable off-set of effects ('comedown).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA#Subjective_effects|title=2-FMA|work=PsychonautWiki|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}</ref>
