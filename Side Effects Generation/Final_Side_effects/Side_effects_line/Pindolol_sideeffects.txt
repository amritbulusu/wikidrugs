Similar to propranolol with an extra contraindication for hyperthyroidism. In patients with thyrotoxicosis, possible deleterious effects from long-term use of pindolol have not been adequately appraised. Beta-blockade may mask the clinical signs of continuing hyperthyroidism or complications, and give a false impression of improvement. Therefore, abrupt withdrawal of pindolol may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including thyroid storm.<ref>http://www.rxmed.com/b.main/b2.pharmaceutical/b2.1.monographs/CPS-%20Monographs/CPS-%20%28General%20Monographs-%20V%29/VISKEN.html</ref>

 
Pindolol is a [[binding selectivity|non-selective]] [[beta blocker]] or [[β-adrenergic receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] with [[partial agonist]] activity and also possesses [[Beta blocker#Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity|intrinsic sympathomimetic activity]]. This means that pindolol, particularly in high doses, exerts effects like [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) or [[isoprenaline]] (increased pulse rate, increased blood pressure, bronchodilation), but these effects are limited. Pindolol also shows [[membrane-stabilizing effect]]s like [[quinidine]], possibly accounting for its antiarrhythmic effects. It also acts as a [[serotonin]] [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] weak [[partial agonist]] ([[intrinsic activity]] = 20–25%) or functional [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].<ref name="pmid16475955">{{cite journal | vauthors = Artigas F, Adell A, Celada P | title = Pindolol augmentation of antidepressant response | journal = Curr Drug Targets | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–47 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16475955 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

 
Pindolol is rapidly and well absorbed from the GI tract. It undergoes some first-pass-metabolization leading to an oral bioavailability of 50-95%. Patients with uremia may have a reduced bioavailability. Food does not alter the bioavailability, but may increase the resorption. Following an oral single dose of 20&nbsp;mg peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1-2 hours. The effect of pindolol on pulse rate (lowering) is evident after 3 hours. Despite the rather short halflife of 3-4 hours, hemodynamic effects persist for 24 hours after administration. Plasma halflives are increased to 3-11.5 hours in patients with renal impairment, to 7-15 hours in elderly patients, and from 2.5-30 hours in patients with liver cirrhosis. Approximately 2/3 of pindolol is metabolized in the liver giving hydroxylates, which are found in the urine as gluconurides and ethereal sulfates. The remaining 1/3 of pindolol is excreted in urine in unchanged form.

 
Pindolol has been investigated as an [[adjunct therapy|add-on drug]] to [[antidepressant]] therapy with SSRIs like [[fluoxetine]] in the treatment of [[depression (mood)|depression]] since 1994.<ref name="pmid25689398" /> The rationale behind this strategy has its basis in the fact that pindolol is an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor.<ref name="pmid23757185">{{cite journal | vauthors = Celada P, Bortolozzi A, Artigas F | title = Serotonin 5-HT1A receptors as targets for agents to treat psychiatric disorders: rationale and current status of research | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 703–16 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23757185 | doi = 10.1007/s40263-013-0071-0 | url = }}</ref> [[Presynaptic]] and [[somatodendritic]] 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors act as [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]] [[autoreceptor]]s, inhibit [[serotonin]] [[neurotransmitter release|release]], and are pro-depressive in their action.<ref name="pmid23757185" /> This is in contrast to postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, which mediate antidepressant effects.<ref name="pmid23757185" /> By blocking 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors at doses that are [[binding selectivity|selective]] for them over postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, pindolol may be able to disinhibit serotonin release and thereby improve the antidepressant effects of SSRIs.<ref name="pmid23757185" /> The results of augmentation therapy with pindolol have been encouraging in early studies of low quality.<ref name="pmid9635544">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blier P, Bergeron R | title = The use of pindolol to potentiate antidepressant medication | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 59 Suppl 5 | issue = | pages = 16–23; discussion 24–5 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9635544 | doi = | url = }}</ref> However, a 2015 [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] of five [[randomized controlled trial]]s found no overall significant benefit.<ref name="pmid25689398">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Zhou X, Zhu D, Chen J, Qin B, Zhang Y, Wang X, Yang D, Meng H, Luo Q, Xie P | title = Is pindolol augmentation effective in depressed patients resistant to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors?
