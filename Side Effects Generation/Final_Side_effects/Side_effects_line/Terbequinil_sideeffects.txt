'''Terbequinil''' ('''SR-25776''') is a [[stimulant]] and [[nootropic]] drug which acts as a partial [[inverse agonist]] at benzodiazepine sites on the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]. In human trials it was found to partially reverse the [[sedative]] and [[amnestic]] effects of the hypnotic drug [[triazolam]] with only slight effects when administered by itself.<ref>Warot D, Danjou P, Douillet P, Keane P, Puech AJ. Cognitive impairments induced by triazolam in healthy volunteers: antagonism by a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptor. ''Therapie''. 1994 Jan-Feb;49(1):23-6. {{PMID|8091361}}</ref>
