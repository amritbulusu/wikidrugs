The [[LD50]] (oral, rat) is 59&nbsp;mg/kg, indicating that the compound is relatively toxic. It is not [[mutagen]]ic nor [[teratogen]]ic according to Ullmann's Encyclopaedia,<ref name=Ullmann/> but "embryotoxic and produces some teratogenic effects" according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer.<ref name=IARC>{{cite journal |title= Hexachlorophene |journal= International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - Summaries & Evaluations |volume= 20 |pages= 241 |origyear= 1979 |year= 1998 |publisher= IPCS Inchem |url= http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol20/hexachlorophene.html}}</ref> [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] (TCDD) is always a contaminant in this compounds production. Several accidents releasing many kilograms of TCDD have been reported. The reaction between 2,4,5-[[trichlorophenol]] and Formaldehyde is exothermic, if this reaction goes without adequate cooling, TCDD becomes a major byproduct/contaminant. Examples of TCDD disaster due to Hexachlorophene production: [[Seveso disaster]], [[Times Beach, Missouri]], Etc.
