The generic name cisatracurium was conceived by scientists at Burroughs Wellcome Co. (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) by combining the name "atracurium" with "cis" [hence ''cis''atracurium] because the molecule is one of the three ''cis''-''cis'' isomers comprising the ten isomers of the parent, [[atracurium]].<ref name = Stenlake1984 />  Atracurium itself was invented at Strathclyde University and licensed to [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]], [[Research Triangle Park, NC]], for further development and subsequent marketing as Tracrium. As the secondary pharmacology of atracurium was being developed, it became clear that the primary clinical disadvantage of atracurium was likely to be its propensity to elicit histamine release. To address this issue, a program was initiated to investigate the individual isomer constituents of atracurium to identify and isolate the isomer(s) associated with the undesirable histamine effects as well as identify the isomer that might possibly retain the desirable properties without the histamine release. Thus, in 1989, D A Hill and G L Turner, PhD (both chemists at Burroughs Wellcome Co., Dartford, UK) first synthesized cisatracurium as an individual isomer molecule. The pharmacological research of cisatracurium and the other individual isomers<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199607000-00023 | vauthors = Wastila WB, Maehr RB, Turner GL, Hill DA, Savarese JJ | title = Comparative pharmacology of cisatracurium (51W89), atracurium, and five isomers in cats | journal = Anesthesiol |date=Jul 1996 | volume = 85 | issue = 1  | pages = 169–177 | pmid = 8694363}}</ref> was then developed further primarily by R. Brandt Maehr and William B. Wastila, PhD (both of whom were pharmacologists within the Division of Pharmacology at Burroughs Wellcome Co.) in collaboration with John J. Savarese MD (who at the time was an anesthesiologist in the Dept. of Anesthesia, [[Harvard Medical School]] at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Boston]], MA). Thereafter, the entire clinical development of [[cisatracurium]] was completed in a record short period from 1992 to 1994: the team of scientists was led by J. Neal Weakly PhD, Martha M. Abou-Donia PhD, and Steve Quessy PhD, in the Division of Clinical Neurosciences at [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]], [[Research Triangle Park]], NC.  By the time of its approval for human use, in 1995, by the US Food and Drug Administration, [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]] had merged with [[Glaxo Inc.]], and cisatracurium was approved to be marketed as Nimbex by [[GlaxoWellcome Inc.]] The trade name "Nimbex" was derived from inserting an "i" to the original proposal "Nmb''ex''," which stood for '''ex'''cellent '''N'''euro'''m'''uscular '''b'''locker.

Cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination as a primary route of chemodegradation: consequently one of the metabolites from this process is [[laudanosine]], a tertiary amino alkaloid reported to be a modest CNS stimulant with epileptogenic activity<ref name = Standaert>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000542-198512000-00002 | author = Standaert FG | title = Magic bullets, science, and medicine | journal = Anesthesiol | volume = 63 | pages = 577–578 |date=Dec 1985 | pmid = 2932980 | issue = 6}}</ref> and cardiovascular effects such as [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and a [[bradycardia|slowed heart rate]].<ref name = Fodale>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fodale V, Santamaria LB | title = Laudanosine, an atracurium and cisatracurium metabolite | journal = Eur J Anaesthesiol | volume = 19| pages = 466–473 |date=Jul 2002| pmid = 12113608 | issue = 7 | doi=10.1017/s0265021502000777}}</ref> As a tertiary amine, Laudanosine is unionised and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. Presently, there is little evidence that laudanosine accumulation and related toxicity will likely ever be seen with the doses of cisatracurium that are administered in clinical practice especially given that the plasma concentrations of laudanosine generated are lower with cisatracurium than those seen with atracurium.<ref name = Fodale />
