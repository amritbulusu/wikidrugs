Tolterodine, although it acts on all types of receptors, has fewer side effects than [[oxybutynin]] (M<sub>3</sub> and M<sub>1</sub> selective, but more so in the parotid than in the bladder) as tolterodine targets the bladder more than other areas of the body. This means that less drug needs to be given daily (due to efficient targeting of the bladder) and so there are fewer side effects.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
