Chlordiazepoxide has a medium to long [[half-life]] but its active metabolite has a very long half-life.

The research into the safety of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is limited and it is recommended that use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. If chlordiazepoxide is used during pregnancy the risks can be reduced via using the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time possible. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided during the [[first trimester]] of pregnancy. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are considered to be among the safer benzodiazepines to use during pregnancy in comparison to other benzodiazepines. Possible adverse effects from benzodiazepine use during pregnancy include, [[abortion]], [[malformation]], [[intrauterine growth retardation]], functional deficits, [[carcinogenesis]] and [[mutagenesis]]. Caution is also advised during [[breast feeding]] as chlordiazepoxide passes into breast milk.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Iqbal | first1 = MM. | last2 = Aneja | first2 = A. | last3 = Fremont | first3 = WP. | title = Effects of chlordiazepoxide (Librium) during pregnancy and lactation. | journal = Conn Med | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 259–62 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12802839 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.53.1.39 | last1 = Iqbal | first1 = MM. | last2 = Sobhan | first2 = T. | last3 = Ryals | first3 = T. | title = Effects of commonly used benzodiazepines on the fetus, the neonate, and the nursing infant. | journal = Psychiatr Serv | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–49 |date=Jan 2002 | pmid = 11773648 }}</ref>

Chlordiazepoxide in laboratory mice studies impairs latent learning.  Benzodiazepines impair learning and memory via their action on benzodiazepine receptors, which causes a dysfunction in the cholinergic neuronal system in mice.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nabeshima T |author2=Tohyama K|author3=Ichihara K|author4=Kameyama T. |date=November 1990 | title = Effects of benzodiazepines on passive avoidance response and latent learning in mice: relationship to benzodiazepine receptors and the cholinergic neuronal system | journal = J Pharmacol Exp Ther. | volume = 255 | issue = 2 | pages = 789&ndash;94 | pmid = 2173758 }}</ref> It was later found that scopolamine impairment in learning was caused by an increase in benzodiazapine/GABA activity (and that benzodiazepines were not associated with the cholinergic system).<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=1316618 |title=Assessment of a cholinergic contribution to chlordiazepoxide-induced deficits of place learning in the Morris water maze |date=2012-10-19 |volume=41 |issue=3 |journal=Pharmacol.

Chlordiazepoxide acts on [[benzodiazepine]] allosteric sites that are part of the  GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor/ion-channel complex and this results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter [[GABA]] to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor thereby producing inhibitory effects on the [[central nervous system]] and body similar to the effects of other [[benzodiazepines]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Skerritt JH |author2=Johnston GA. | date =  May 6, 1983 |  title = Enhancement of GABA binding by benzodiazepines and related anxiolytics | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 89 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 193&ndash;8 | pmid = 6135616 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(83)90494-6 }}</ref> Chlordiazepoxide is [[anticonvulsant]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Life Sci | date =  February 25, 1985 |  volume = 36| issue = 8| pages = 737&ndash;44| title = Effect of GABA agonists on the neurotoxicity and anticonvulsant activity of benzodiazepines| author = Chweh AY|author2=Swinyard EA|author3=Wolf HH|author4=Kupferberg HJ| pmid = 2983169| doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(85)90193-6}}</ref>

 
There is preferential storage of chlordiazepoxide in some organs including the heart of the neonate. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate. The withdrawal of chlordiazepoxide during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as chlordiazepoxide rapidly crosses the placenta and also is excreted in breast milk.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olive G |author2=Dreux C. |date=January 1977 | title = Pharmacologic bases of use of benzodiazepines in peréinatal medicine | journal = Arch Fr Pediatr | volume = 34 | pages = 74&ndash;89 | pmid = 851373 | issue = 1 }}</ref>  Chlordiazepoxide also decreases prolactin release in rats.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grandison L |year=1982 |title=Suppression of prolactin secretion by benzodiazepines in vivo |journal=Neuroendocrinology |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=369&ndash;73 |pmid=6979001 |doi=10.1159/000123330}}</ref> Benzodiazepines act via [[micromolar]] benzodiazepine binding sites as [[Ca2+]] channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive Calcium uptake in animal nerve terminal preparations.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |date=May 1984 | volume = 81 | issue = 10 | pages = 3118&ndash;22 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/81/10/3118.pdf |format=PDF| type = PDF | title = Micromolar-affinity benzodiazepine receptors regulate voltage-sensitive calcium channels in nerve terminal preparations | author = Taft WC |author2=DeLorenzo RJ | pmid = 6328498 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.81.10.3118 | pmc = 345232}}</ref> Chlordiazepoxide inhibits [[acetylcholine]] release in mouse hippocampal synaptosomes in vivo.

Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine drug. The half-life of Chlordiazepoxide is 5 – 30 hours but has an active benzodiazepine metabolite (desmethyldiazepam), which has a half-life of 36 – 200 hours.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bcnc.org.uk/equivalence.html | title = Benzodiazepine equivalency table | accessdate = September 23, 2007 | author = Ashton CH. |date=April 2007 }}</ref> The half-life of chlordiazepoxide increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration. Delayed body clearance of the long half-life active metabolite also occurs in those over 60 years of age, which further prolongs the effects of the drugs with additional accumulation after repeated dosing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vozeh S. | date =  November 21, 1981 |  title = [Pharmacokinetic of benzodiazepines in old age] | journal = Schweiz Med Wochenschr. | volume = 111 | issue = 47 | pages = 1789&ndash;93 | pmid = 6118950 }}</ref>

 
Chlordiazepoxide (initially called ''methaminodiazepoxide'') was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesised in the mid-1950s. Chlordiazepoxide was synthesised from work on a chemical dye, quinazolone-3-oxides. It was discovered by accident when in 1957 tests revealed that the compound had [[hypnotic]], [[anxiolytic]] and [[muscle relaxant]] effects. Three years later chlordiazepoxide was marketed as a therapeutic benzodiazepine medication under the brand name Librium. Following chlordiazepoxide, in 1963 [[diazepam]] hit the market under the brand name Valium - and was followed by many further benzodiazepine compounds over the subsequent years and decades.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.etfrc.com/benzos1.htm|title=The Complete Story of the Benzodiazepines|last=Cooper|first=Jack R|date=January 15, 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-510399-8|edition=seventh|location=USA|pages=|author2=Floyd E.

In 1959 it was used by over 2,000 physicians and more than 20,000 patients. It was described as "chemically and clinically different from any of the tranquilizers, psychic energizers or other psychotherapeutic drugs now available." During studies, chlordiazepoxide induced muscle relaxation and a quieting effect on laboratory animals like mice, [[rat]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[dog]]s. Fear and aggression were eliminated in much smaller doses than those necessary to produce hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is similar to [[phenobarbital]] in its [[anticonvulsant]] properties. However, it lacks the hypnotic effects of [[barbiturates]]. Animal tests were conducted in the [[Franklin Park Zoo|Boston Zoo]] and the [[San Diego Zoo]]. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for acute and chronic alcoholism, and various [[psychoses]] and [[neuroses]] were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a majority of the patients, [[anxiety]], [[Stress (biology)|tension]], and motor excitement were "effectively reduced." The most positive results were observed among [[alcoholic]] patients. It was reported that [[ulcer]]s and [[Dermatology|dermatologic]] problems, both of which involving emotional factors, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide.<ref>{{cite news | authorlink = New York Times | author=New York Times | title = Help For Mental Ills (Reports on Tests of Synthetic Drug Say The Results are Positive) | publisher = New York Times | location = USA | page = E9 | date = 28 February 1960 }}</ref>
