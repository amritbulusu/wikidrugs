'''LY-2183240''' is a drug which acts both as a potent inhibitor of the [[reuptake]] of the [[endocannabinoid]] [[anandamide]] and as an inhibitor of [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] (FAAH), the primary [[enzyme]] responsible for degrading anandamide. This leads to markedly elevated anandamide levels in the brain, and LY-2183240 has been shown to produce both [[analgesic]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects in animal models.<ref>Dickason-Chesterfield AK, Kidd SR, Moore SA, Schaus JM, Liu B, Nomikos GG, Felder CC.
