In the phase II study of 12 boys, dystrophin production was increased in 72% of the participants. It is questioned whether increasing the dose — which is feasible due to the lower toxicity of eteplirsen compared to [[drisapersen]] — would benefit the non-responders and whether this could result in any increased side effects.  A phase III study has begun in the USA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02255552 |title=Confirmatory Study of Eteplirsen in DMD Patients (PROMOVI) |author=Sarepta Therapeutics |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=US Government, NIH |accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

 
This study demonstrated the potential of this approach for increasing the levels of dystrophin in the short term. The trial’s principal aim was to work out the appropriate dosages of the drug, therefore the drug’s safety profile and effects will need to be confirmed in larger, longer-term studies, particularly as patients would need to take it for the rest of their lives (or until a better treatment is available).<ref name=Cirak2011>{{cite journal |last1=Cirak |first1=Sebahattin |last2=Arechavala-Gomeza |first2=Virginia |last3=Guglieri |first3=Michela |last4=Feng |first4=Lucy |last5=Torelli |first5=Silvia |last6=Anthony |first6=Karen |last7=Abbs |first7=Stephen |last8=Garralda |first8=Maria Elena |last9=Bourke |first9=John |last10=Wells |first10=Dominic J |last11=Dickson |first11=George |last12=Wood |first12=Matthew JA |last13=Wilton |first13=Steve D |last14=Straub |first14=Volker |last15=Kole |first15=Ryszard |last16=Shrewsbury |first16=Stephen B |last17=Sewry |first17=Caroline |last18=Morgan |first18=Jennifer E |last19=Bushby |first19=Kate |last20=Muntoni |first20=Francesco |title=Exon skipping and dystrophin restoration in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy after systemic phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer treatment: an open-label, phase 2, dose-escalation study |journal=The Lancet |volume=378 |issue=9791 |pages=595–605 |year=2011 |pmid=21784508 |pmc=3156980 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60756-3 |laysummary=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/07July/Pages/research-new-drug-muscular-dystrophy.aspx |laysource=NHS Choices |laydate=July 25, 2011 }}</ref>

 
==Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and potential side effects==

 
* Clinical safety data shows that there has been no adverse effects from treatment with Eteplirsen-based off the doses administered in several trials.
