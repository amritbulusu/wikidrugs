'''Enprostil''' is a synthetic [[prostaglandin]] designed to resemble [[dinoprostone]]. Enprostil was found to be a highly potent inhibitor of gastric HCl secretion.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3095537 |year=1986 |last1=Roszkowski |first1=AP |last2=Garay |first2=GL |last3=Baker |first3=S |last4=Schuler |first4=M |last5=Carter |first5=H |title=Gastric antisecretory and antiulcer properties of enprostil, (+/−)-11 alpha, 15 alpha-dihydroxy-16-phenoxy-17,18,19,20-tetranor-9-oxoprosta-4,5,13(t)-trienoic acid methyl ester |volume=239 |issue=2 |pages=382–9 |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics}}</ref> It is an analog of [[prostaglandin E2]] but unlike this prostaglandin, which binds to and activates all four cellular [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] viz., [[Prostaglandin EP1 receptor|EP1]], [[Prostaglandin EP2 receptor|EP2]], [[Prostaglandin EP3 receptor|EP3]], and [[Prostaglandin EP4 receptor|EP4]] receptors, enprostil is a more selective [[receptor agonist]] in that it binds to and activates primarily the EP3 receptor.<ref name="pmid27940058">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreno JJ | title = Eicosanoid receptors: Targets for the treatment of disrupted intestinal epithelial homeostasis | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 796 | issue = | pages = 7–19 | year = 2017 | pmid = 27940058 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.12.004 | url = }}</ref> Consequently, enprostil is expected to have a narrower range of actions that may avoid some of the unwanted side-effects and toxicities of prostaglandin E2.
