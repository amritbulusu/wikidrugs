'''JWH-149''' is a synthetic cannabimimetic that was discovered by John W. Huffman. It is the N-pentyl analog of [[JWH-148]]. It is a potent but only moderately selective ligand for the [[Cannabinoid receptor 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]]  receptor, with a binding affinity of ''K''<sub>i</sub> = 0.73 ± 0.03 nM at this subtype, and more than 6 times selectivity over the CB<sub>1</sub> subtype.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.bmc.2004.09.050 |pmid= 15582455 |year= 2005 |last= Huffman |first= J.|title= Structure-activity relationships for 1-alkyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indoles at the cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors: steric and electronic effects of naphthoyl substituents.
