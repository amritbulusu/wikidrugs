==Side-effects and withdrawal from market==

 
On April 7, 2005, Pfizer withdrew Bextra from the U.S. market on recommendation by the FDA, citing an increased risk of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]] and also the risk of a serious, sometimes fatal, skin reaction. This was a result of recent attention to prescription [[NSAIDs]], such as [[Merck & Co.|Merck's]] [[Rofecoxib|Vioxx]]. Other reported side-effects were [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and [[Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome]].

 
In a large study published in [[The Journal of the American Medical Association]] in 2006, valdecoxib appeared less adverse for renal (kidney) disease and heart arrhythmia compared to Vioxx, however elevated renal risks were slightly suggested.<ref name="JAMA">{{cite journal |url=http://www.cox2drugreview.org |title=Adverse Effects of Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors on Renal and Arrhythmia Events: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials |journal=JAMA |date=2006 |last1=Zhang |first1=J J. |last2=Ding |first2=E.
