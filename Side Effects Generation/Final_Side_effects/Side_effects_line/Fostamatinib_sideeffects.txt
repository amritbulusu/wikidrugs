The investigation of fostamatinib began with studies involving the treatment of mouse models with cytopenia. Mice were used to measure the effectiveness of R788, a small molecule prodrug of the biologically active R406, a Syk inhibitor. In animal models, treatment with R406/R788 was shown to be safe and effective in reducing inflammation and joint damage in immune-mediated rheumatoid arthritis. The models responded favorably to treatment so the study progressed to Phase 2 trials involving humans. Human studies have shown that R788 has good oral bioavailability, biologic activity, is well tolerated, and does not exhibit collagen or ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In NCT00706342, 16 adults with chronic ITP were entered into an open-label, single-arm cohort dose-escalation trials beginning with 75&nbsp;mg and rising to 175&nbsp;mg twice a day. The dose was increased until a persistent response was evident, toxicity was reached, or 175&nbsp;mg twice a day was met. 8 patients achieved persistent responses with platelet counts greater than 50,000&nbsp;mm<sup>3</sup>/L on more than 67% of their visits. 3 of these patients had not persistently responded to thrombopoietic agents. 4 others had nonsustained responses. Mean peak platelet count exceeded 100,000&nbsp;mm<sup>3</sup>/L in these 12 patients. Toxicity was evidenced primarily in GI-related side effects, notable diarrhea, urgency, and vomiting. 2 patients developed transaminitis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00706342|title=Pilot Study of Fostamatinib Disodium/R935788 for the Treatment of Adult Refractory Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref>

 
Fostamatinib as a treatment for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is in Phase II trials, which will conclude at the end of 2016. IgAN is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with inflammation in the kidneys that reduces their ability to successfully filter blood. There are currently no disease-targeted therapies for IgAN. Participants are currently being recruited from the US, Austria, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the UK. Patients must be between 18 and 70 years old, have renal biopsy findings consistent with IgA nephropathy, have been treated with an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and/or an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) for at least 90 days at the maximum approved dose, have a proteinuria > 1 gm/day at diagnosis of IgA nephropathy and a level > 0.5 gm/day at the second screening visit, and a blood pressure controlled to â‰¤ 1302/80 with angiotensin blockade. Eligible candidates cannot have recently used cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, Rituximab, or > 15&nbsp;mg/day of prednisone or any other corticosteroid equivalent. The study investigates whether fostamatinib is a safe and effective treatment for IgAN. It is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, ascending-dose, placebo-controlled clinical study. Primary outcome measures include the mean change in proteinuria as measured by spot urine protein/creatinine ratio (sPCR). Effects were evaluated for 100&nbsp;mg, 150&nbsp;mg, and placebo formulations taken twice daily by mouth for 24 weeks. The study began in October 2014 and is expected to complete by June 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02112838|title=Safety and Efficacy Study of Fostamatinib to Treat Immunoglobin A (IgA) Nephropathy - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref>
