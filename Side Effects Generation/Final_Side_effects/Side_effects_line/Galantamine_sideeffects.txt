The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and international health authorities have published an alert of galantamine based on data from two studies during the treatment for [[Mild cognitive impairment| mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]]; higher mortality rates were seen in drug-treated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm126138.pdf|title=FDA ALERT: Galantamine hydrobromide (marketed as Razadyne, formerly Reminyl) - Healthcare Professional Sheet|date=May 2005|work=Postmarket Drug Safety Information for Patients and Providers|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm152595.htm|title=Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products > Reminyl (galantamine hydrobromide)|date=March 2005|work=# MedWatch The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> On April 27, 2006, FDA approved labeling changes concerning all form of galantamine preparations (liquid, regular tablets, and extended release tablets) warning of the risk of [[bradycardia]] (slow resting heart rate), and sometimes atrioventricular block, especially in predisposed persons.

Galantamine is a potent [[Allosteric modulator|allosteric]] potentiating [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] of human [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] (nAChRs) [[Α4β2 nicotinic receptor|α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub>]], [[Α3β4 nicotinic receptor|α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>4</sub>]], and [[α6β4|α<sub>6</sub>β<sub>4</sub>]], and chicken/mouse nAChRs [[Α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|α<sub>7</sub>]]/[[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]] in certain areas of the brain.<ref name="nicotinic receptor">{{cite journal |first1=Marek |last1=Samochocki |first2=Anja |last2=Höffle |first3=Andreas |last3=Fehrenbacher |first4=Ruth |last4=Jostock |first5=Jürgen |last5=Ludwig |first6=Claudia |last6=Christner |first7=Martin |last7=Radina |first8=Marion |last8=Zerlin |first9=Christoph |last9=Ullmer |first10=Edna F.

Galantamine's effects on nAChRs and complementary acetylcholinesterase inhibition make up a dual mechanism of action. It is hypothesized that this action might relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's.

 
Since galantamine in metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, inhibiting either of these [[isoenzymes]] will increase the cholinergic effects of galantamine.<ref name="springer" /> Inhibiting these enzymes may lead to adverse effects.<ref name="springer" /> It was found that [[paroxetine]], an inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the [[bioavailability]] of galantamine by 40%.<ref name="springer" /> The CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and [[erythromycin]] increased the [[bioavailability]] of galantamine by 30% and 12%, respectively.<ref name="springer" />

 
The toxicity of [[organophosphate]]s results primarily from their action as irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.<ref name = "organo" /> Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase causes an increase in acetylcholine, as the enzyme is no longer available to catalyze its breakdown.<ref name = "organo" /> In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine accumulation can cause an overstimulation of muscarinic receptors followed by a desensitization of nicotinic receptors.<ref name = "organo" /> This leads to severe skeletal muscle fasciculations (involuntary contractions).<ref name = "organo" /> The effects on the central nervous system include [[anxiety]], restlessness, [[confusion]], [[ataxia]], [[tremor]]s, [[seizures]], cardiorespiratory paralysis, and [[coma]].<ref name = "organo" /> As a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine has the potential to serve as an effective organophosphate poisoning treatment by preventing irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition.<ref name = "organo" /> Additionally, galantamine has [[anticonvulsant]] properties which may make it even more desirable as an antidote.<ref name = "organo" />

 
Galantamine may have some limited use in reducing the side-effects of anesthetics [[ketalar]] and [[diazepam]]. In one study, a control group of patients were given [[ketalar]] and [[diazepam]] and underwent [[anesthesia]] and surgery.<ref name="anesth">{{cite journal|author=Chakalova E, Marinova M, Srebreva M, Anastasov D, Ploskov K.|title=Attempt to eliminate residual somnolence and disorientation with nivaline after anesthesia with ketalar and diazepam for minor obstetrical and gynecologic surgery|journal=Akush Ginekol (Sofiia)|date=1987|volume=26|issue=3|pages=28–31|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3631427|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> The experimental group was given [[ketalar]], [[diazepam]], and nivalin (of which the active ingredient is galantamine).<ref name="anesth" /> The degree of drowsiness and disorientation of the two groups was then assessed 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after surgery.<ref name="anesth" /> The group that had taken nivalin were found to be more alert 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the surgery.<ref name="anesth" />
