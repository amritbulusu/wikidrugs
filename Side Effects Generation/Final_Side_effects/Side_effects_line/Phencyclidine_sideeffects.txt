The reinforcing properties of PCP and ketamine are mediated by the binding of these drugs to specific sites in the channel of the NMDA glutamate receptor, where they act as noncompetitive antagonists.

'''Phencyclidine''' ('''PCP'''), also known as '''angel dust''' among other names,<ref>US Department of Justice, National Drug Intelligence Center. [http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs4/4440/ PCP Fast Facts]</ref> is a [[dissociative drug]]. PCP was brought to market in the 1950s as an [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] [[pharmaceutical drug]] but was taken off the market in 1965 due to the high prevalence of [[dissociative]] [[hallucinogen]]ic side effects. Moreover, the discovery of [[ketamine]] by [[Parke-Davis]] researchers was thought to represent a better-tolerated alternative for use as an anesthetic [[medication]]. Since then a number of synthetic derivatives of PCP have been sold as dissociative drugs for recreational and non-medical use.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris H, Wallach J | title = From PCP to MXE: a comprehensive review of the non-medical use of dissociative drugs | journal = Drug Testing and Analysis | volume = 6 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 614–32 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24678061 | doi = 10.1002/dta.1620 }}</ref>

 
In [[chemistry|chemical]] structure, PCP is a member of the [[arylcyclohexylamine]] [[chemical classification|class]], and, in [[pharmacology]], it is a member of the family of [[dissociative anesthetic]]s. PCP works primarily as an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]. As an [[addictive drug]], PCP is associated with compulsive abuse.<ref name="NHM-PCP and ketamine" /><ref name="Morris" /><ref>Drugs and Behavior, 4th Edition, McKim, William A., {{ISBN|0-13-083146-8}}</ref><ref>Kapur, S. and P.

===Effects===

 
Behavioral effects can vary by dosage. Low doses produce a numbness in the extremities and intoxication, characterized by staggering, unsteady gait, slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and loss of balance. Moderate doses (5–10&nbsp;mg intranasal, or 0.01–0.02&nbsp;mg/kg intramuscular or intravenous) will produce [[analgesia]] and anesthesia. High doses may lead to [[convulsions]].<ref name="Diaz">Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996.</ref> The drug is often illegally produced under poorly-controlled conditions; this means that users may be unaware of the actual dose they are taking.<ref name="Neuroscience for Kids">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/pcp.html|title=Neuroscience for Kids – PCP| last= Chudler| first= Eric H.|accessdate=2011-01-26|work=Neuroscience for Kids}}</ref>

 
Psychological effects include severe changes in [[body image]], [[Ego death|loss of ego boundaries]], [[paranoia]], and [[depersonalization]]. Hallucinations, [[euphoria]], and [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal impulses]] are also reported, as well as occasional aggressive behavior.<ref name=Inciardi />{{rp|48–49}}<ref name="Diaz" /> Like many other drugs, PCP has been known to alter mood states in an unpredictable fashion, causing some individuals to become detached, and others to become animated.

Fewer than 30 different analogues of PCP were reported as being used on the street during the 1970s and 1980s, mainly in the USA.<ref name="Morris" /> The best known of these are [[rolicyclidine]] (PCPy or 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine); [[eticyclidine]] (PCE or ''N''-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine); and [[tenocyclidine]] (TCP or 1-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)piperidine).<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/pcp/pcp_index.html PCP synthesis and effects]</ref> Only of a few of these compounds were widely used.<ref name="Morris" />

 
The generalized structural motif required for PCP-like activity is derived from structure-activity relationship studies of PCP derivatives, and summarized in the illustration (right). All of these derivatives are likely to share some of their psychoactive effects with PCP itself, although a range of potencies and varying mixtures of anesthetic, dissociative and stimulant effects are known, depending on the particular drug and its substituents. In some countries such as the USA, Australia, and New Zealand, all of these compounds would be considered [[Federal Analog Act|controlled substance analogues]] of PCP, and are hence illegal drugs if sold for human consumption, even though many of them have never been made or tested.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Itzhak Y, Kalir A, Weissman BA, Cohen S | title = New analgesic drugs derived from phencyclidine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 496–9 | date = May 1981 | pmid = 7241506 | doi = 10.1021/jm00137a004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudieu I, Vignon J, Chicheportiche M, Kamenka JM, Trouiller G, Chicheportiche R | title = Role of the aromatic group in the inhibition of phencyclidine binding and dopamine uptake by PCP analogs | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 699–705 | date = Mar 1989 | pmid = 2544905 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(89)90020-8 }}</ref>{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}

 
It is commonly mistakenly reported that PCP was first synthesized in 1926.<ref>[http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/pcp.pdf Development of PCP], 2006, CESAR (Center for Substance Abuse Research)</ref> This early synthesis, in fact, refers to the PCP [[Reaction intermediate|intermediate]] PCC.<ref name="Morris" /> PCP was actually discovered by Victor Maddox, a chemist at [[Parke-Davis]] in Michigan, while investigating synthetic analgesic agents. Although unexpected, PCP was identified as potentially interesting, and as such, was submitted for pharmacological testing. The promising results of these pharmacological investigations led to the rapid development of PCP. It was approved for use as an investigational drug under the brand names Sernyl and Sernylan in the 1950s as an anesthetic, but because of its long [[biological half-life|terminal half-life]] and adverse [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]], such as hallucinations, [[mania]], [[delirium]], and [[disorientation]], it was removed from the market in 1965 and limited to veterinary use.<ref name="Morris" /><ref name=LowinsonEtAl2005>{{cite book |year=2005 |author=Zukin, Stephen R |author2=Sloboda, Zili |author3=Javitt, Daniel C |chapter=Phencyclidine (PCP) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C&pg=PA324&dq=Phencyclidine+history&hl=en&ei=lVH3TLLzJYrWvQOW-PCdDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Phencyclidine%20history&f=false|editor=Lowinson, Joyce H |editor2=Ruiz, Pedro |editor3=Millman, Robert B |editor3-link=Robert Millman |display-editors = 3 |editor4=Langrod, John G |title=Substance Abuse: A Comprehensive Textbook |edition=4th |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=0-7817-3474-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=substance+comprehensive+textbook#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Drug Use and Abuse |last=Maisto |first=Stephen A. |author2=Mark Galizio |author3=Gerard Joseph Connors |year=2004 |publisher=Thompson Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-508517-4 }}</ref>
