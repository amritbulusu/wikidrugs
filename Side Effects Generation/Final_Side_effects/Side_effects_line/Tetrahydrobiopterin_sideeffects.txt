== Adverse effects ==

 
The most common [[adverse effects]], observed in more than 10% of patients, include headache and a running or obstructed nose. Diarrhea and vomiting are also relatively common, seen in at least 1% of patients.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|date=1 March 2017|language=German|at=Kuvan 100 mg-Tabletten}}</ref>

 
Other than PKU studies, tetrahydrobiopterin has participated in clinical trials studying other approaches to solving conditions resultant from a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin.  These include [[autism]], [[ADHD]], [[hypertension]], [[endothelial dysfunction]], and [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=kuvan&pg=2 ClinicalTrials.gov: Search results for Kuvan]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/biomarin-initiates-phase-3b-study-evaluate-effects-kuvan-neurophychiatric-symptoms-su|title=BioMarin Initiates Phase 3b Study to Evaluate the Effects of Kuvan on Neurophychiatric Symptoms in Subjects with PKU|date=17 August 2010|publisher=BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc}}</ref> Experimental studies suggest that tetrahydrobiopterin regulates deficient production of nitric oxide in cardiovascular disease states, and contributes to the response to inflammation and injury, for example in pain due to nerve injury. A 2015 BioMarin-funded study of PKU patients found that those who responded to tetrahydrobiopterin also showed a reduction of ADHD symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ymgme.2014.11.011 |pmid=25533024 |title=A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of sapropterin to treat ADHD symptoms and executive function impairment in children and adults with sapropterin-responsive phenylketonuria |journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=415–24 |year=2015 |last1=Burton |first1=B. |last2=Grant |first2=M. |last3=Feigenbaum |first3=A. |last4=Singh |first4=R. |last5=Hendren |first5=R. |last6=Siriwardena |first6=K. |last7=Phillips |first7=J. |last8=Sanchez-Valle |first8=A. |last9=Waisbren |first9=S. |last10=Gillis |first10=J. |last11=Prasad |first11=S. |last12=Merilainen |first12=M. |last13=Lang |first13=W. |last14=Zhang |first14=C. |last15=Yu |first15=S. |last16=Stahl |first16=S. }}</ref>

 
In 1997, a small pilot study was published on the efficacy of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) on relieving the symptoms of autism, which concluded that it "might be useful for a subgroup of children with autism" and that double-blind trials are needed, as are trials which measure outcomes over a longer period of time.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.1997.tb07437.x |pmid=9236697 |title=Possible effects of tetrahydrobiopterin treatment in six children with autism - clinical and positron emission tomography data: A pilot study |journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=313–8 |year=2008 |last1=Fernell |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Watanabe |first2=Yasuyoshi |last3=Adolfsson |first3=Ingrid |last4=Tani |first4=Yoshihiro |last5=Bergström |first5=Mats |last6=Phd |first6=Per Hartvig |last7=Md |first7=Anders Lilja |last8=Phd. |first8=Anne-Liis von Knorring MD. |last9=Phd. |first9=Christopher Gillberg MD. |last10=Phd. |first10=Bengt Lángström }}</ref> In 2010, [[Richard E.
