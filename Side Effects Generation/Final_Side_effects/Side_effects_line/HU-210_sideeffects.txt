The (+) [[enantiomer]] of HU-210 has almost all of the cannabinoid activity, with the (−) enantiomer [[HU-211]] being inactive as a [[cannabinoid]] but instead acting as an [[NMDA antagonist]] having [[neuroprotective]] effects.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Howlett | first1 = A.| last2 = Champion | first2 = T.| last3 = Wilken | first3 = G.| last4 = Mechoulam | first4 = R.| title = Stereochemical effects of 11-OH-Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol-dimethylheptyl to inhibit adenylate cyclase and bind to the cannabinoid receptor| journal = Neuropharmacology| volume = 29| issue = 2| pages = 161–5| year = 1990| pmid = 2158635| doi = 10.1016/0028-3908(90)90056-W}}</ref><ref name="pmid14534855">{{cite journal |author=Darlington CL |title=Dexanabinol: a novel cannabinoid with neuroprotective properties |journal=IDrugs : the Investigational Drugs Journal |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=976–9 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14534855 }}</ref>

 
HU-210 promotes [[cell proliferation|proliferation]], but not [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], of cultured embryonic [[hippocampal]] [[Neural stem cell|neural stem]] and [[progenitor cell]]s likely via a sequential activation of [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB<sub>1</sub> receptors]], [[G proteins|G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins]], and [[MAPK/ERK pathway|ERK signaling]]. It was also indicated by this increased [[neural]] growth to entail [[antianxiety]] and [[antidepressant]] effects.<ref name="pmid16224541">{{Cite journal |author= Jiang, W.|title= Cannabinoids promote embryonic and adult hippocampus neurogenesis and produce anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects |journal= The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume= 115 |issue= 11 |pages= 3104–3116 |year= 2005 |pmid= 16224541 |doi= 10.1172/JCI25509 |pmc= 1253627 |display-authors=etal}}

 
HU-210 is a potent [[analgesic]] with many of the same effects as natural THC.
