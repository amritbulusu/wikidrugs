In several [[clinical trial]]s, clocapramine has been compared to other [[neuroleptic]] agents. Against [[haloperidol]], though there was no significant difference in efficacy at the end of the study, clocapramine tended to be superior in alleviating [[motor retardation]], [[alogia]], and [[thought disorder]], and also produced fewer [[side effect]]s.<ref name="pmid4076529">{{cite journal | author = Yamagami S | title = A crossover study of clocapramine and haloperidol in chronic schizophrenia | journal = The Journal of International Medical Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 301–10 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4076529 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Against [[sulpiride]], clocapramine demonstrated more favorable effects in the treatment of both [[Schizophrenia#Positive and negative symptoms|positive]] and [[Schizophrenia#Positive and negative symptoms|negative]] [[symptom]]s, including motor retardation, [[delusion]]s, [[hallucination]]s, and [[social isolation]], though it produced more side effects.<ref name="pmid3246215">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamagami S, Kiriike N, Kawaguchi K | title = A single-blind study of clocapramine and sulpiride in hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients | journal = Drugs under Experimental and Clinical Research | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 707–13 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3246215 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Against [[timiperone]], clocapramine showed lower efficacy against both positive and negative symptoms and produced more side effects such as [[dyskinesia]], [[insomnia]], [[constipation]], and [[nausea]].<ref name="pmid6139317">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakazawa T, Ohara K, Sawa Y | title = Comparison of efficacy of timiperone, a new butyrophenone derivative, and clocapramine in schizophrenia: a multiclinic double-blind study | journal = The Journal of International Medical Research | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 247–58 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6139317 | doi = | url = |display-authors=etal}}</ref>
