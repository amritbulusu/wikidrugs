Sulfadimethoxine, like all sulfonamides, diffuses easily when it is in its unionized, [[Lipid soluble|lipid-soluble]] form, and easily reaches many tissues. The relative amounts are determined by both its [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] and by the [[pH]] of each tissue. Therefore, levels tend to be higher in less acidic tissue and body fluids or in diseased tissues having high concentrations of [[leucocytes]].<ref name="stowe">{{Cite book | editor-last=Jones | editor-first=LM | last=Stowe | first=CM | title=Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics | chapter=Chapter 33: The Sulfonamides | location=Ames, Iowa | date=1965 | publisher=Iowa State University Press}}</ref><ref name="dailymed" /><ref name="merck" /> Its ability to bind to [[plasma proteins]] is very high, leading sulfadimethoxine to maintain higher blood levels than most other long-acting sulfonamides. Comparatively low doses can give rapid and sustained therapeutic blood levels.<ref name="dailymed" /> Most animals for which sulfadimethoxine is marketed [[acetylate]] sulfadimethoxine in the [[liver]] to form acetylsulfadimethoxine, which is secreted in the [[bile]]. Dogs are the exception – since they are unable acetylate sulfanamides, they excrete sulfadimethoxine mostly unchanged in the urine (their inability to transform sulfadimethoxine also makes them more susceptible to negative side effects).<ref name="plumb">{{Cite book | last=Plumb | first=Donald C. | title=Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook | location= Ames, Iowa | date=2011 | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | isbn=9780470959640 | pages=951, 954}}</ref><ref name="saunders">{{Cite book | last=Papich | first=Mark G. | title=Saunders handbook of veterinary drugs | location=St. Louis, Mo | date=2007 | edition=2nd ed | publisher=Saunders/Elsevier | isbn=9781416028888}}</ref><ref name="bridges">{{Cite journal | last1=Bridges | first1=J.
