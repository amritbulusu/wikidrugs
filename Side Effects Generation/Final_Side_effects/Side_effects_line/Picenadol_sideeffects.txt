It is unusual in that one [[enantiomer]] is a pure [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] [[agonist]], while the other is an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]].<ref>Leander JD, Zimmerman DM. Effects of picenadol and its agonist and antagonist isomers on schedule-controlled behavior. ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics''. 1983 Dec;227(3):671-5.</ref> The (3R,4R) isomer is the agonist, while (3S,4S) is antagonist.<ref>Froimowitz M, Cody V. Absolute configurations and conformations of the opioid agonist and antagonist enantiomers of picenadol. ''Chirality''. 1995;7(7):518-25.</ref> This means that the racemic mix of the two enantiomers is a mixed agonist-antagonist, with relatively low [[Drug abuse|abuse potential]], and little of the [[Kappa opioid receptor|κ-opioid]] activity that tends to cause problems with other opioid mixed agonist-antagonists such as [[pentazocine]].<ref>Zimmerman DM, Smits SE, Hynes MD, Cantrell BE, Leander JD, Mendelsohn LG, Nickander R.
