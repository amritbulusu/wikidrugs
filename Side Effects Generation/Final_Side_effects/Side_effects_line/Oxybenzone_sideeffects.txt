At low temperatures, however, it is possible to observe both the [[phosphorescence]] and the triplet-triplet absorption spectrum. At 175 K the triplet lifetime is 24 ns. The short lifetime has been attributed to a fast intramolecular hydrogen transfer between the oxygen of the C=O and the OH.<ref name="Chrétien">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00644.x |title=Reducing Adverse Effects from UV Sunscreens by Zeolite Encapsulation: Comparison of Oxybenzone in Solution and in Zeolites |year=2010 |last1=ChréTien |first1=Michelle N. |last2=Heafey |first2=Eve |last3=Scaiano |first3=Juan C. |journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology |volume=86 |pages=153–61 |pmid=19930122 |issue=1}}</ref>

Despite its photoprotective qualities, much controversy surrounds oxybenzone because of its possible hormonal and photoallergenic effects, leading many countries to regulate its use.
