Colesevelam is one of the [[Bile acid sequestrant|bile-acid sequestrants]], which along with niacin and the statins, are the three main types of cholesterol-lowering agents. The statins are considered the first-line agents. This is because of the larger body of evidence supporting statins' ability to prevent cardiovascular disease, as well as the prominent side effects from the other two types, including bloating and constipation (bile-acid sequestrants) and skin flushing (niacin). These side effects often lead to low patient compliance.<ref>Principles and Practice of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2000, ed. Becker, chapter 163</ref>

 
Colesevelam is part of a class of drugs known as bile acid sequestrants. Colesevelam hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in '''Welchol''', is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol 7-Î±-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged.<ref>RxList: [http://www.rxlist.com/welchol-drug.htm Welchol]</ref>

 
== Side effects ==

 
The background incidence of flatulence and diarrhea was in patients in the same controlled clinical trials, the placebo were higher. Only constipation and dyspepsia were shown to occur in a higher percentage of patients who received Cholestagel, compared to the placebo reported. Side effects were generally mild or moderate in severity.  In the application of colesevelam in combination with statins, no unexpected frequent side effects occurred.<ref name="fi">[http://www.genzyme.de/prod/pdf-prod/de_pdf_pt_chol_fachinfo.pdf Consumer information for cholestagel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719031609/http://www.genzyme.de/prod/pdf-prod/de_pdf_pt_chol_fachinfo.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}, March 2009 {{de icon}}</ref>
