3-MeO-PCP was first synthesized in 1979 to investigate the [[structure–activity relationship]]s of [[phencyclidine]] (PCP) [[chemical derivative|derivative]]s. The effects of 3-MeO-PCP in humans were not described until 1999 when a chemist using the pseudonym John Q. Beagle wrote that 3-MeO-PCP was qualitatively similar to PCP with comparable [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]].<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal|first1=H.|last1=Morris|first2=J.|last2=Wallach|title=From PCP to MXE: a comprehensive review of the non-medical use of dissociative drugs|journal=Drug Testing and Analysis|year=2014|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1620/abstract||doi=10.1002/dta.1620|volume=6|pages=614–632|pmid=24678061}}</ref> 3-MeO-PCP was preceded by the less potent dissociative [[4-MeO-PCP]] and first became available as a research chemical in 2011.<ref name="Morris"/>
