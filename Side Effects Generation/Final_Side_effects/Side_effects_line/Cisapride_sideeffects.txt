'''Cisapride''' is a [[gastroprokinetic agent]], a [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] that increases [[motility]] in the upper [[gastrointestinal tract]]. It acts directly as a [[serotonin]] [[5-HT4 receptor|5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]] and indirectly as a [[parasympathomimetic]]. Stimulation of the serotonin receptors increases [[acetylcholine]] release in the [[enteric nervous system]]. It has been sold under the trade names '''Prepulsid''' (Janssen-Ortho) and '''Propulsid''' (in the United States). It was discovered by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1980.  In many countries, it has been either withdrawn from the market or had its indications limited because of side-effects.

 
The commercial preparations of this drug are the [[racemic]] mixture of both [[enantiomer]]s of the compound. The (+) enantiomer itself<!-- what is the absolute configuration? --> has the major pharmacologic effects and does not induce many of the detrimental side-effects of the mixture.<ref>{{US patent reference |number = 5955478 |y=  1999 |m= Sep |d= 21 | inventor = Nancy M.
