As zopiclone is [[sedative|sedating]], it is marketed as a sleeping pill. It works by causing a depression or tranquilization of the central nervous system.  After prolonged use, the body can become accustomed to the effects of zopiclone. When the dose is then reduced or the drug is abruptly stopped, withdrawal symptoms may result. These can include a range of symptoms similar to those of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]]. Although withdrawal from therapeutic doses of zopiclone and its isomers (i.e. [[eszopiclone]]) do not typically present with convulsions and are therefore not considered life-threatening, patients may experience such significant agitation or anxiety that they seek emergency medical attention.

 
Zopiclone is known colloquially as a "[[Z-drug]]". Other Z-drugs include [[zaleplon]] (Sonata) and [[zolpidem]] (Ambien and AmbienCR) and were initially thought to be less addictive or habit-forming than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat in the last few years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. Zopiclone is recommended to be taken on a short-term basis, usually a week or less.<ref>http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/TA077publicinfoenglish.pdf</ref> Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised, and caution must be taken when the compound is used in conjunction with antidepressants, sedatives or other drugs affecting the central nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2744064 |url= |year=1989 |author=Van, Der, Kleijn, E |title=Effects of zopiclone and temazepam on sleep, behaviour and mood during the day |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=247–251 |issn=0031-6970 |journal=European journal of clinical pharmacology |doi=10.1007/BF00558155 }}</ref>

 
An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that considerable evidence of the effectiveness and lasting benefits of nondrug treatments for insomnia exist. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, such as zopiclone, offer few if any advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents such as the [[Melatonin receptor agonist]]s may be more suitable and effective for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and is discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as [[Developmental disability|cognitive impairment]] ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs remains to be determined.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother |date=June 2006 | volume = 4 | issue = 2 |pages = 168–192 | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | author = Bain KT | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006}}</ref>

Zopiclone is in the [[cyclopyrrolone]] family of drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include [[suriclone]]. Zopiclone, although molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a [[full agonist]], which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to produce zopiclone's pharmacological properties.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Blanchard JC |author2=Julou L.  |date=March 1983 | title = Suriclone: a new cyclopyrrolone derivative recognizing receptors labeled by benzodiazepines in rat hippocampus and cerebellum | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 601–607 | pmid = 6298365  | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.1983.tb08023.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=6135616|date=May 1983|author1=Skerritt, Jh |author2=Johnston, Ga |title=Enhancement of GABA binding by benzodiazepines and related anxiolytics.|volume=89|issue=3-4|pages=193–198|issn=0014-2999|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|url=|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(83)90494-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2905900 |date=September 1988 |author1=De, Deyn, Pp |author2=Macdonald, Rl |title=Effects of non-sedative anxiolytic drugs on responses to GABA and on diazepam-induced enhancement of these responses on mouse neurones in cell culture |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=109–120 |issn=0007-1188 |pmc=1854132 |journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]] |doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1988.tb16554.x}}</ref> In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties, it also has some [[barbiturate]]-like properties.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Julou L |author2=Bardone MC |author3=Blanchard JC |author4=Garret C |author5=Stutzmann JM.  | year = 1983 | title = Pharmacological studies on zopiclone | journal = Pharmacology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 46–58 | pmid = 6142468| doi = 10.1159/000137911 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Blanchard JC |author2=Boireau A |author3=Julou L.  | year = 1983 | title = Brain receptors and zopiclone | journal = Pharmacology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 59–69 | pmid = 6322210| doi = 10.1159/000137912 }}</ref>

 
After oral administration, zopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a bioavailability around 75–80%. Time to peak plasma concentration is 1–2 hours. High-fat meal preceding zopiclone administration does not change absorption (as measured by [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]]), but reduces peak plasma levels and delays its occurrence, thus may delay the onset of therapeutic effects.

The eszopiclone/zopiclone difference is in the dosage&mdash;the strongest eszopiclone derivative dosage contains 3&nbsp;mg of the therapeutic stereoisomer, whereas the highest zopiclone dosage (7.5&nbsp;mg) contains 3.75&nbsp;mg of the active stereoisomer. The two agents have not yet been studied in head-to-head clinical trials to determine the existence of any potential clinical differences (efficacy, side effects, developing dependence on the drug, safety, etc.).

 
Zopiclone has the potential for misuse and dosage escalation, drug abuse, and drug dependence. It is abused orally and sometimes intravenously, and often combined with alcohol to achieve a combined sedative hypnotic—alcohol euphoria. Patients abusing the drug are also at risk of dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be seen after long-term use of normal doses even after a gradual reduction regimen. The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties recommends zopiclone prescriptions not exceed 7 to 10 days, owing to concerns of addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cimolai N |title=Zopiclone: is it a pharmacologic agent for abuse? |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=12 |pages=2124–2129 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18077750 |pmc=2231551 |doi= }}</ref> Two types of drug misuse can occur: either recreational misuse, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW |title=Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=31–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16336040 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoffmann F, Pfannkuche M, Glaeske G |title=[High usage of zolpidem and zopiclone.

Zopiclone and other sedative hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range and often in combination with other alcohol, illegal, or [[prescription drug]]s of abuse, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jones AW |author2=Holmgren A |author3=Kugelberg FC.  |date=April 2007 | title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–260 | pmid = 17417081 | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31803d3c04}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bramness JG, Skurtveit S, Mørland J |title=[Detection of zopiclone in many drivers&mdash;a sign of misuse or abuse] |language=Norwegian |journal=Tidsskrift for Den Norske Laegeforening |volume=119 |issue=19 |pages=2820–2821 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10494203 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Zopiclone, which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons.
