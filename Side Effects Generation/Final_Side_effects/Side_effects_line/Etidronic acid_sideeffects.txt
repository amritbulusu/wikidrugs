Etidronic acid is a [[chelating agent]] and may be added to bind or, to some extent, counter the effects of substances, such as [[calcium]], [[iron]] or other [[metal ion]]s, which may be discharged as a component of grey wastewater and could conceivably contaminate groundwater supplies. As a phosphonate it has [[corrosion]] inhibiting properties on unnalloyed [[steel]]. Etidronic acid also acts to retard rancidification and oxidation of fatty acids.

 
HEDP and its salts are added to [[detergent]]s and other cleaning agents to prevent the effects of [[hard water]]. It is also used in [[peroxide]] bleaching to prevent degradation of peroxides by [[transition metals]].
