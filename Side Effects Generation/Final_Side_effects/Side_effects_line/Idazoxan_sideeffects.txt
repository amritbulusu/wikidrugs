'''Idazoxan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[drug]] which is used in [[scientific research]]. It acts as both a selective [[alpha-2 receptor|α2]] [[adrenergic receptor]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]], and an antagonist for the [[imidazoline receptor]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bousquet | first1 = P | last2 = Bruban | first2 = V | last3 = Schann | first3 = S | last4 = Greney | first4 = H | last5 = Ehrhardt | first5 = JD | last6 = Dontenwill | first6 = M | last7 = Feldman | first7 = J | title = Participation of imidazoline receptors and alpha(2-)-adrenoceptors in the central hypotensive effects of imidazoline-like drugs | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 881 | pages = 272–8 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10415925 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09369.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = RW | last2 = Harris | first2 = J | title = RX 821002 as a tool for physiological investigation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors | journal = CNS Drug Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–92 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12177687 | doi=10.1111/j.1527-3458.2002.tb00222.x}}</ref> Idazoxan has been under investigation as an [[antidepressant]], but it did not reach the market as such. More recently, it is under investigation as an adjunctive treatment in [[schizophrenia]]. Due to its alpha-2 receptor antagonism it is capable of enhancing therapeutic effects of [[antipsychotics]], possibly by enhancing [[dopamine]] [[neurotransmission]] in the [[prefrontal cortex]] of the brain, a brain area thought to be involved in the [[pathogenesis]] of schizophrenia.
