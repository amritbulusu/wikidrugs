'''Dexloxiglumide''' is a drug which acts as a [[cholecystokinin antagonist]], selective for the [[Cholecystokinin A receptor|CCK<sub>A</sub>]] subtype. It inhibits gastrointestinal motility and reduces gastric secretions, and despite older selective CCK<sub>A</sub> antagonists such as [[lorglumide]] and [[devazepide]] having had only limited success in trials and ultimately never making it into clinical use, dexloxiglumide is being investigated as a potential treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal problems including [[irritable bowel syndrome]],<ref>Cremonini F, Camilleri M, McKinzie S, Carlson P, Camilleri CE, Burton D, Thomforde G, Urrutia R, Zinsmeister AR.
