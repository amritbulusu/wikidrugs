'''Veliparib''' ('''ABT-888''')<ref>[http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/13/9/2728.full "ABT-888, an Orally Active Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor that Potentiates DNA-Damaging Agents in Preclinical Tumor Models"] May 2007</ref> is a potential anti-cancer drug acting as a [[PARP inhibitor]]. It kills cancer cells by blocking a protein called PARP, thereby preventing the repair of DNA or genetic damage in cancer cells and possibly making them more susceptible to anticancer treatments. Veliparib may make whole brain radiation treatment work more effectively against brain metastases from NSCLC. It has been shown to potentiate the effects of many chemotherapeutics, and as such has been part of many combination clinical trials.<ref name=adis/>
