Pseudoephedrine is a [[sympathomimetic]] [[amine]]. Its principal mechanism of action relies on its direct action on the [[adrenergic receptor]] system.<ref name="American Medical Association, AMA Department of Drugs 1977 627">{{cite book|last=American Medical Association, AMA Department of Drugs|title=AMA Drug Evaluations|date=1977|publisher=PSG Publishing Co., Inc.|page=627}}</ref><ref name="Thomson/Micromedex 2007 2452">{{cite book|last=Thomson/Micromedex|title=Drug Information for the Health Care Professional, Volume 1,|date=2007|location=Greenwood Village, CO.|page=2452}}</ref>  The [[vasoconstriction]] that pseudoephedrine produces is believed to be principally an α-adrenergic receptor response.<ref name='drew'>{{cite journal | pmc = 1429447 | year = 1978 | last1 = Drew | first1 = CD | last2 = Knight | first2 = GT | last3 = Hughes | first3 = DT | last4 = Bush | first4 = M | title = Comparison of the effects of D-(−)-ephedrine and L-(+)-pseudoephedrine on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in man | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 221–225 | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1978.tb04588.x | pmid=687500}}</ref>

 
Pseudoephedrine is a [[stimulant]], but it is well known for shrinking swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a [[decongestant]]. It reduces tissue [[hyperemia]], [[edema]], and [[nasal congestion]] commonly associated with [[common cold|colds]] or [[allergy|allergies]]. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] secretions, and opening of obstructed [[Eustachian tube]]s. The same [[vasoconstriction]] action can also result in [[hypertension]], which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine.

 
Pseudoephedrine can be used either as oral or as [[topical decongestant]]. However, due to its stimulating qualities, the topical nasal preparation is more likely to cause adverse effects, including [[urinary retention]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auanet.org/education/urinary-incontinence.cfm|title=American Urological Association - Medical Student Curriculum - Urinary Incontinence|publisher=American Urological Association|accessdate=2015-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishjournalpediatrics.org/?fullTextId=481&lang=eng |title=Acute urinary retention due to pseudoephedrine hydrochloride in a 3-year-old child |publisher=The Turkish Journal of Pediatrics |accessdate=2015-08-12}}</ref> According to one study, pseudoephedrine may show effectiveness as an [[antitussive]] drug (suppression of [[Cough medicine|cough]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kiyoshi Minamizawa | url = http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jphs/102/1/102_136/_article | title = Effect of d-Pseudoephedrine on Cough Reflex and Its Mode of Action in Guinea Pigs | journal = Journal of Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 102  | year = 2006 | issue = 1 | pages = 136–142 | doi = 10.1254/jphs.FP0060526 | pmid = 16974066  | displayauthors = etal  }}</ref>

 
===Adverse effects===

 
The antihypertensive effects of [[methyldopa]], [[mecamylamine]], [[reserpine]] and [[veratrum alkaloids]] may be reduced by sympathomimetics. [[Beta-adrenergic antagonist]]s may also interact with sympathomimetics. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with [[digitalis]]. [[Antacids]] increase the rate of pseudoephedrine absorption, while [[kaolin]] decreases it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
