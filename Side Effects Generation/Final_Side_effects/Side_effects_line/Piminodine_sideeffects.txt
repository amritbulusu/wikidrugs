'''Piminodine''' ('''Alvodine''') is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] that is an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[pethidine]] (meperidine).<ref>Sim E, Dimoglo A, Shvets N, Ahsen V. Electronic-topological study of the structure-activity relationships in a series of piperidine morphinomimetics. ''Current Medicinal Chemistry''. 2002 Aug;9(16):1537-45.</ref> It was used in medicine briefly during the 1960s and 70s, but has largely fallen out of clinical use.  It was used particularly for obstetric analgesia and in dental procedures and, like pethidine, could be combined with [[hydroxyzine]] to intensify the effects.  The duration of action is 2 to 4 hours and 7.5 to 10 mg via the subcutaneous route is the most common starting dose, being equal to 80 to 100 mg of pethidine, 40 to 60 mg of [[alphaprodine]] and 10 mg of [[morphine]].  Oral formulations were also available.

 
Piminodine has similar effects to other opioids, and produces analgesia, sedation and euphoria. Side effects can include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]] which can be life-threatening.<ref>Dekornfeld TJ, Lasagna L.
