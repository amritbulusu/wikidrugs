'''Azacitidine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; trade name '''Vidaza''') is a chemical [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[cytidine]], a [[nucleoside]] in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Azacitidine and its deoxy derivative, [[decitabine]] (also known as 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine), are used in the treatment of [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]. Both drugs were first synthesized in [[Czechoslovakia]] as potential [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic agent]]s for cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cihák A.|title=Biological effects of 5-azacytidine in eukaryotes|journal=Oncology|volume=30|issue=5|pages=405–422|year=1974|pmid=4142650|doi=10.1159/000224981}}</ref>

 
Azacitidine can be used ''[[in vitro]]'' to remove [[methyl]] groups from [[DNA]]. This may weaken the effects of gene silencing mechanisms that occur prior to methylation. Certain methylations are believed to secure DNA in a silenced state, and therefore demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and confer relative gene activation.<ref>Whitelaw E. and Garrick D.

Renal toxicity, ranging from elevated serum [[creatinine]] to [[kidney]] failure and death, have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for conditions other than myelodysplastic syndrome. Renal tubular acidosis developed in five patients with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (an unapproved use) treated with azacitidine and [[etoposide]], and patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys, so patients with renal insufficiency should be closely monitored for other side effects, since their levels of azacitidine may progressively increase.<ref name=label/>

 
Azacitidine can also nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, redness at its injection sites, constipation, bruising, petechiae, rigors, weakness, abnormally low potassium levels in the bloodstream, and many other side effects, some of which can be severe or even fatal.<ref name=label/>
