A [[Phases of clinical research#Phase II|Phase II]] study that used an [[intranasal]] formulation of pleconaril failed to show a statistically significant result for either of its two primary efficacy endpoints, percentage of participants with rhinovirus [[PCR]]-positive colds and percentage of participants with asthma exacerbations together with rhinovirus-positive PCR.<ref>National Institutes of Health.
