Delapril is a prodrug; it is converted into two active metabolites, 5-hydroxy delapril diacid and delapril diacid. These metabolites bind completely to and inhibit [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE), hence blocking angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion. The resulting vasodilation prevents the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex is also decreased by Delapril, leading to increases in excretion of sodium and therefore increases water outflow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/delapril#section=Pharmacology-and-Biochemistry|title=DELAPRIL {{!}} C26H32N2O5 - PubChem|last=Pubchem|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-08-28}}</ref>
