Methoxyflurane is an extremely [[Potency (pharmacology)|potent]] and highly [[Lipophilicity|lipid-soluble]] anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is [[Flammability|non-flammable]], has relatively mild [[Hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] effects, and it does not predispose the heart to [[cardiac dysrhythmia|rhythm disturbances]]. It is, however, a significant [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depressant]]. Methoxyflurane has powerful [[analgesic]] (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for [[obstetrics|obstetric]] analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the [[patient-controlled analgesia]] [[infusion pump]]s of today.

 
The [[biodegradation]] of methoxyflurane produces [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] [[fluoride]] and [[dichloroacetic acid]] (DCAA). The combined effects of these two [[Chemical compound|compounds]] may be responsible for the [[toxicity]] of methoxyflurane to some of the major [[Human anatomy#Major organ systems|organs]] of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be [[Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and [[hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic]] (damaging to the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a [[General anaesthetic|general anesthetic]] in the late 1970s.<ref name="Mazze, Richard I.

M pp 843"/> It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of [[Dressing (medical)|wound dressings]] or for [[Casualty movement|transport of injured people]].

 
Each 3&nbsp;milliliter dose lasts approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=Penthrox2009/> Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths and continues for several minutes after stopping inhalation.<ref name=Wellness2010/> The maximum recommended dose is 6&nbsp;milliliters per day or 15&nbsp;milliliters per week because of the risk of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days.<ref name=RADAR2010/> Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects have been reported in the literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6&nbsp;milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation.<ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=Grindlay2009/><ref name=Rossi2008/> Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) [[toxicity]], methoxyflurane is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in patients with pre-existing [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] or [[diabetes mellitus]], and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or [[Enzyme inducer|enzyme-inducing]] drugs.<ref name=Grindlay2009/>

 
;Cardiovascular effects

 
The effects of methoxyflurane on the circulatory system resemble those of diethyl ether.<ref name=Siebecker1961/> In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate [[hypotension|decrease in blood pressure]] with minimal changes in [[heart rate]], and no significant effect on [[blood sugar]], [[epinephrine]], or [[norepinephrine]]. [[Bleeding]] and increased [[arterial blood gas|arterial]] [[partial pressure]] of [[carbon dioxide]] (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine.<ref name=Millar1961/> In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but [[cardiac output]], [[stroke volume]], and [[total peripheral resistance]] are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the [[pulmonary circulation]] is negligible, and it does not predispose the heart to [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]s.<ref name=Wyant1961/><ref name=Artusio1960/><ref name=VANPOZNAK1960-1/><ref name=VANPOZNAK1960-2/>
