Difloxacin has been used concurrently with ectoparasiticides, antiepileptics, anesthetics, antihistamines, and topical anti-inflammatory drugs without adverse effects.  It inhibits the metabolism of theophylline, caffeine, cyclosporine and warfarin.  Azlocillin, cimetidine and probenecid increase blood levels of difloxacin.  Compounds (i.e. sucralfate, antacids, multivitamins) containing di- and trivalent cations (i.e. iron, aluminum, calcium, magnesium and zinc) may substantially interfere with the absorption of quinolones from the intestinal tract resulting in decreased bioavailability.  Therefore, the concurrent oral administration of quinolones with foods, supplements or other preparations containing any of these compounds should be avoided.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":4" />

 
== Adverse effects ==

 
Like other fluoroquinolones, difloxacin causes arthropathy in immature growing animals, particularly dogs.  Otherwise, it is very well tolerated.  The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal effects such as vomiting, diarrhea and anorexia, even in overdose.  Only supportive measures, and not additional treatment, are recommended for management of overdose or toxicity as the reactions are self-limiting.
