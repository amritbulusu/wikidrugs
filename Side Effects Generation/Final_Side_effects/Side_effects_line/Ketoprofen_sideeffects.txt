'''Ketoprofen''', '''(RS)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid''' (chemical formula C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is one of the [[propionic acid]] class of [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAID) with [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]] effects.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kantor, T.

In some countries, the optically pure (''S'')-enantiomer ([[dexketoprofen]]) is available; its [[Tris|trometamol]] salt is said to be particularly rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects.

 
In horses, it is given at a dose of 2.2&nbsp;mg/kg/day. Studies have shown that it does not inhibit [[5-lipoxygenase]] and [[leukotriene B4]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Salman | first1 = JA | last2 = Tilling | first2 = LC | last3 = Monscada | first3 = S | year = 1984 | title = Benoxaprofen does not inhibit formation of leukotriene B4 in a model of acute inflammation | url = | journal = Biochem Pharmacol | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 28–2930 }}</ref> as originally claimed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Betley | first1 = M | last2 = Sutherland | first2 = SF | last3 = Gregoricka | first3 = MJ | last4 = Pollett | first4 = RA | year = 1991 | title = The analgesic effect of ketoprofen for use in treating equine colic as compared to flunixin meglumine | url = | journal = Equine Pract | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 11–16 }}</ref> It is therefore not considered superior to [[phenylbutazone]] as previously believed, although clinical signs of lameness are reduced with its use.<ref>Owens JG, Kamerling SG, Keowen ML.

Ketoprofen, when administered [[intravenously]], is recommended for a maximum of five days of use.  Its analgesic and antipyretic effects begin to occur one to two hours following administration.  The most common dosage is 1&nbsp;mg/ lb, once per day, although this dosage may be lowered for ponies, which are most susceptible to NSAID side effects.  

 
Experiments have found ketoprofen, like [[diclofenac]], is a veterinary drug causing lethal effects in [[red-headed vulture]]s. Vultures feeding on the carcasses of recently treated livestock suffer acute kidney failure within days of exposure.<ref name="Naidoo2009">{{cite journal|vauthors=Naidoo V, Wolter K, Cromarty D, Diekmann M, Duncan N, Meharg AA, Taggart MA, Venter L, Cuthbert R |year=2009|title=Toxicity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to Gyps vultures: a new threat from ketoprofen|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=3|pages=339–341|issn=1744-9561|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0818|pmid=20007163|pmc=2880042}}</ref>
