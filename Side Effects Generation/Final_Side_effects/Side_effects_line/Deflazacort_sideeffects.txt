Deflazacort carries the risks common to all [[corticosteroids]], including [[immune suppression]], decreased [[bone density]], and [[endocrine]] insufficiency. In clinical trials, the most common side effects (>10% above placebo) were [[Cushing's]]-like appearance, weight gain, and increased appetite.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/208684s000,208685s000lbl.pdf</ref>

 
Deflazacort's potency is around 70â€“90% that of [[prednisone]].<ref name="eMC"/>  A 2017 review found its activity of 7.5&nbsp;mg of deflazacort is approximately equivalent to 25&nbsp;mg [[cortisone]], 20&nbsp;mg [[hydrocortisone]], 5&nbsp;mg of [[prednisolone]] or [[prednisone]], 4&nbsp;mg of [[methylprednisolone]] or [[triamcinolone]], or 0.75&nbsp;mg of [[betamethasone]] or [[dexamethasone]].  The review noted that the drug has a high [[therapeutic index]], being used at initial oral doses ranging from 6 to 90&nbsp;mg, and probably requires a 50% higher dose to induce the same demineralizing effect as prednisolone.  Thus it has "a smaller impact on calcium metabolism than any other synthetic corticosteroid, and therefore shows a lower risk of growth rate retardation in children and of osteoporosis" in the elderly, and comparatively small effects on carbohydrate metabolism, sodium retention, and hypokalemia.<ref>{{cite web|pmc=5216559|title=Deflazacort: therapeutic index, relative potency and equivalent doses versus other corticosteroids|author=Luca Parente|journal=BMC Pharmacol Toxicol.|year=2017|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s40360-016-0111-8}}</ref>
