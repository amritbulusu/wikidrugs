'''Perhexiline''' ''(Pexsig)'' is a prophylactic [[antianginal agent]] used primarily in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Perhexiline is thought to act by inhibiting [[mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1]]. This shifts myocardial metabolism from fatty acid to glucose utilisation which results in increased ATP production for the same O<sub>2</sub> consumption and consequently increases myocardial efficiency. Its clinical use has been limited by its narrow [[therapeutic index]] and high inter- and intra-individual [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] variability. It was outlawed in many countries due to its adverse effects on [[poor metaboliser]]s (PM). The product has been reintroduced for patients who have [[contraindication]]s, or have not responded to other treatments for angina.

 
The adverse effects of perhexiline have been seen in more than 60% of recipients in some clinical trials. The most commonly reported adverse effects include headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Plasma perhexiline concentrations as low as 0.6mg/L> are known to cause nausea and dizziness; however, perhexiline is also known to cause [[hepatotoxicity]] and [[peripheral neuropathy]] at plasma concentrations >0.6mg/L.<ref name="ref9">Barclay, M.L., Sawyers, S.M., Begg, E.J., ''et al.''
