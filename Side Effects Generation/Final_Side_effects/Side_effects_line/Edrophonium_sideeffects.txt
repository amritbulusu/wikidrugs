Edrophonium (by the so-called Tensilon test) is used to differentiate [[myasthenia gravis]] from [[cholinergic crisis]] and [[Lambert-Eaton]]. In myasthenia gravis, the body produces [[autoantibodies]] which block, inhibit or destroy [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] in the neuromuscular junction. Edrophonium—an effective [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]—will reduce the muscle weakness by blocking the enzymatic effect of [[acetylcholinesterase]] enzymes, prolonging the presence of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. It binds to a Serine-103 allosteric site, while pyridostigmine and neostigmine bind to the AchE active site for their inhibitory effects.  In a cholinergic crisis, where a person has too much [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|neuromuscular]] stimulation, edrophonium will make the muscle weakness worse by inducing a [[Neuromuscular-blocking drugs#Depolarizing blocking agents|depolarizing block]].
