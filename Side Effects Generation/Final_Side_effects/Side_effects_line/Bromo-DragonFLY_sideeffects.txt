The typical dose of Bromo-DragonFLY is not known, however it has varied from 500 μg to 1&nbsp;mg.<ref name="titleErowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Dosage"/> It has about 300 times the potency of mescaline, or 1/5 the potency of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. It has been sold in the form of [[Blotting paper|blotters]], similar to the distribution method of LSD, which has led to confusion, and reports of mistakenly consuming Bromo-DragonFly. It has a much longer duration of action than LSD and can last for up to 2–3 days<ref name="titleErowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Dosage"/> following a single large dose, with a slow onset of action that can take up to 6 hours before the effects are felt.

 
On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they thought was [[2C-E]], and several others were hospitalized during the same incident. Because they took a dosage appropriate for 2C-E, those who took the drug received, in some cases, 100x the normal dose. Both deaths followed seizures, vomiting blood, and terrifying hallucinations. Several surviving victims are reportedly still suffering from its physical effects.<ref name="Two dead, seven injured after designer drug overdose">[http://www.newson6.com/story/14641463/second-victim-dies-after-taking-designer-drug-in-konawa]</ref>
