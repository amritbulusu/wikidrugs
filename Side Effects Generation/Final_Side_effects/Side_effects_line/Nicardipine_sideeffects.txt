Nicardipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking agent used for the treatment of vascular disorders such as [[Angina pectoris#Stable angina|chronic stable angina]], [[hypertension]], and [[Raynaud's phenomenon]]. It is available in oral and intravenous formulations. Its mechanism of action and clinical effects closely resemble those of [[nifedipine]] and the other dihydropyridines ([[amlodipine]], [[felodipine]]), except that nicardipine is more selective for cerebral and coronary blood vessels. Nicardipine also has a longer half-life than nifedipine. Nicardipine was approved by the FDA in December 1988. The patent for both Cardene and Cardene SR expired in October 1995.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a695032.html Nicardipine at Medline PLus]</ref>
