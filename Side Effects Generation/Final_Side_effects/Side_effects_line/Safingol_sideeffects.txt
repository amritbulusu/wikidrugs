'''Safingol''' is a lyso-[[sphingolipid]] [[protein]] [[kinase]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]. It has the [[molecular formula]] C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>39</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> and is a colorless [[solid]]. [[Medicine|Medicinally]], safingol has demonstrated promising [[anticancer]] potential as a modulator of multi-[[drug resistance]] and as an inducer of [[necrosis]]. The administration of safingol alone has not been shown to exert a significant effect on [[tumor]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[cell growth|growth]].<ref name="Schwartz et al. 1995">Schwartz, G.

Currently in [[Phase I clinical trial]]s, it is believed to be safe to co-administer with [[cisplatin]].<ref name="Ling et al. 2011">Ling, L. U., Tan, K. B., Lin, H., & Chiu, G. N. C. (2011). The role of reactive oxygen species and autophagy in safingol-induced cell death. Cell death & disease, 2(3), e129.

 
The underlying mechanism by which safingol induces cell death is poorly understood. It is believed to exert a variety of inhibitory effects, resulting in a series of [[signal transduction|cascades]] that result in accidental [[necrosis|necrotic]] cell death brought about by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) and mediated by [[autophagy]]. Increased autophagic activity has been associated with increased cellular death, although it is unclear if there is any causative relationship between the two. Because autophagy normally plays a pro-survival role by impeding apoptosis, it is curious that it may play a role in cell death following safingol exposure.

 
Safingol competitively competes with [[phorbol dibutyrate]] at [[protein domain|regulatory domain]]s of the [[protein kinase C]] family, inhibiting the activation of such enzymes as [[PKCβ-I]], [[PKCδ]], and [[PKCε]]. Safingol can also inhibit [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase]] (PI3k), which is a critical component of the [[mTOR]] and [[MAPK/ERK pathway]]s. Furthermore, safingol, like other sphingolipids, has been found to inhibit [[glucose]] uptake. This results in [[oxidative stress]], leading to the generation of ROS that are both time and concentration-dependent. Together, the inhibitory signaling effects (particularly of PKCε and PI3k) and the presence of ROS synergize to induce autophagy.<ref name="Ling et al. 2011" />

 
One potential explanation for safingol’s [[cytotoxicity]] is that high concentrations result in ROS-related molecular and cellular damage that is beyond repair. Therefore, autophagy does not directly contribute to death, but is rather a failed attempt to preserve cell viability. However, not only does this [[hypothesis]] warrants further testing, but safingol has demonstrated unusual regulatory effects on other pathways capable of regulating autophagy.<ref name="Ling et al. 2011" />
