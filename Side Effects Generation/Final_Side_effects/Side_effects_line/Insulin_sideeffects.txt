The human insulin protein is composed of 51 [[amino acid]]s, and has a [[molecular mass]] of 5808 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]. It is a [[protein dimer|dimer]] of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by [[disulfide bond]]s. Insulin's structure varies slightly between [[species]] of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in [[carbohydrate metabolism]] effects) from human insulin because of these variations. [[Pig|Porcine]] insulin is especially close to the [[human]] version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by [[Recombinant DNA#Applications of recombinant DNA technology|recombinant DNA]] technologies.<ref name=recombination>Drug Information Portal NLM – Insulin human USAN http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/</ref><ref name="urlGenentech">{{cite web|url=http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/4160/1978-09-06/first-successful-laboratory-production-o|title=First Successful Laboratory Production of Human Insulin Announced|last=|first=|date=1978-09-06|website=|publisher=Genentech|access-date=|work=News Release|accessdate=2016-09-26}}</ref><ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin">{{cite web | url = http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm | title = Recombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin | author = Tof I  | year = 1994 | work = | publisher = Little Tree Publishing | accessdate = 2009-11-03 }}</ref><ref name="pmid23222785">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aggarwal SR | title = What's fueling the biotech engine-2011 to 2012 | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 1191–7 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23222785 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2437 }}</ref>

 
Within vertebrates, the amino acid sequence of insulin is [[conserved sequence|strongly conserved]]. [[Cow|Bovine]] insulin differs from human in only three [[amino acid]] residues, and [[Pig|porcine]] insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of [[proinsulin]] (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.

 
== Synthesis, physiological effects, and degradation ==

 
* The calcium ion concentration in the cytosol of the beta cells can also, or additionally, be increased through the activation of [[phospholipase|phospholipase C]] resulting from the binding of an extracellular [[ligand]] (hormone or neurotransmitter) to a [[G protein]]-coupled membrane receptor. Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid, [[phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate]], into [[inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate]] and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]]. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) then binds to receptor proteins in the plasma membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). This allows the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the ER via IP3-gated channels, which raises the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions independently of the effects of a high blood glucose concentration. [[Parasympathetic nervous system|Parasympathetic]] stimulation of the pancreatic islets operates via this pathway to increase insulin secretion into the blood.<ref name=stryer1>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

The effects of insulin are initiated by its binding to a receptor present in the cell membrane. The receptor molecule contains an α- and β subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the α-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.<ref name="diabetesincontrol.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/handbook-of-diabetes-4th-edition-excerpt-4-normal-physiology-of-insulin-secretion-and-action/|title=Handbook of Diabetes, 4th Edition, Excerpt #4: Normal Physiology of Insulin Secretion and Action|date=2014-07-28|work=Diabetes In Control.

* '''Induce glycogen synthesis''' – When glucose levels are high, insulin induces the formation of glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a phosphate group in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key for the formation of glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/pancreas/insulin_phys.html|title=Physiologic Effects of Insulin|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref>

Insulin also influences other body functions, such as [[compliance (physiology)#Blood vessels|vascular compliance]] and [[cognition]].

* [[Metabolic syndrome]] – a poorly understood condition first called Syndrome X by [[Gerald Reaven]]. It is currently not clear whether the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for [[Insulin#Physiological effects|insulin response]] in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], type 2 diabetes, and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) to develop.

 
Synthetic insulin can trigger adverse effects, so some people with diabetes rely on animal-source insulin.<ref>http://www.iddt.org/diabetic-commonsense/the-great-debate-natural-animal-or-artificial-human-insulin</ref>

 
Over the next two decades researchers made several attempts to isolate – as a potential treatment – whatever the islets produced. In 1906 [[George Ludwig Zuelzer]] achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but he was unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, E.L. Scott at the [[University of Chicago]] used aqueous pancreatic extracts, and noted "a slight diminution of glycosuria", but was unable to convince his director of his work's value; it was shut down. [[Israel Kleiner (biochemist)|Israel Kleiner]] demonstrated similar effects at [[Rockefeller University]] in 1915, but [[World War I]] interrupted his work and he did not return to it.<ref name="J.

On January 11, 1922, [[Leonard Thompson (diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]], a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the [[Toronto General Hospital]], was given the first injection of insulin.<ref name="pmid8409364">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bliss M | title = Rewriting medical history: Charles Best and the Banting and Best myth | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–74 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8409364 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/48.3.253 }}</ref> However, the extract was so impure, Thompson suffered a severe [[anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], and further injections were canceled. Over the next 12&nbsp;days, Collip worked day and night to improve the ox-pancreas extract, and a second dose was injected on January 23. This was completely successful, not only in having no obvious side-effects but also in completely eliminating the [[glycosuria]] sign of diabetes.
