'''Orvepitant''' ('''GW823296''') is a drug developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] which acts as a selective [[Antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonist]] for the [[Tachykinin receptor 1|NK<sub>1</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].<ref>Di Fabio R, Alvaro G, Braggio S, Carletti R, Gerrard PA, Griffante C, Marchioro C, Pozzan A, Melotto S, Poffe A, Piccoli L, Ratti E, Tranquillini E, Trower M, Spada S, Corsi M. Identification, biological characterization and pharmacophoric analysis of a new potent and selective NK1 receptor antagonist clinical candidate.

It was however considered a successful [[proof of concept]] for NK<sub>1</sub> antagonists as potential antidepressants, and efforts are continuing to find more potent compounds which might be more effective.<ref>Ratti E, Bettica P, Alexander R, Archer G, Carpenter D, Evoniuk G, Gomeni R, Lawson E, Lopez M, Millns H, Rabiner EA, Trist D, Trower M, Zamuner S, Krishnan R, Fava M.
