Studies have shown coluracetam to improve [[learning impairment]] on a single oral dose given to rats which have been exposed to cholinergic [[neurotoxin]]s. Subsequent studies have shown that it may induce long-lasting [[nootropic|procognitive]] effects in [[cholinergic]] neurotoxin-treated rats by changing the [[choline transporter]] regulation system.<ref name="PMID18461272">{{Cite journal | pmid = 18461272 | title = MKC-231, a choline-uptake enhancer: long-lasting cognitive improvement after repeated administration in AF64A-treated rats | doi=10.1007/s00702-008-0053-4 | volume=115 | issue = 7 | date=Jul 2008 | pages=1019–25 | journal=Journal of Neural Transmission| author1 = Bessho | first1 = T | last2 = Takashina | first2 = K | last3 = Eguchi | first3 = J | last4 = Komatsu | first4 = T | last5 = Saito | first5 = K }}</ref>
