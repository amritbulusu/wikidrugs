<small>DL</small>-Methionine is sometimes given as a supplement to dogs; It helps to reduce the chances of stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used.<ref>Grimshaw, Jane (July 25, 2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140629112302/http://www.critters360.com/index.php/methionine-for-dogs-uses-and-side-effects-3841/ Methionine for Dogs uses and Side Effects]. critters360.com</ref>
