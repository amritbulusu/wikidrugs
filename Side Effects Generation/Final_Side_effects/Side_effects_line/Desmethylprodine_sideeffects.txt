Desmethylprodine was first synthesized in 1947 at Hoffman-LaRoche Laboratories by Albert Ziering and John Lee. They found that it produced effects similar to [[morphine]] when administered to rats.<ref>{{Cite journal

In 1976, a 23-year-old graduate student in chemistry named Barry Kidston was searching for a way to make a legal recreational drug. Having read the paper by Ziering and Lee, he deduced that he could make a drug with pethidine's effects without its legal restrictions, since desmethylprodine is a different molecule and had never been addressed by law. Kidston successfully synthesized and used desmethylprodine for several months, after which he suddenly came down with the symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]] and was hospitalized. Physicians were perplexed, since Parkinson's disease would be a great rarity in someone so young, but [[L-dopa]], the standard drug for Parkinson's, relieved his symptoms. L-dopa is a precursor for dopamine, the neurotransmitter whose lack produces Parkinson's symptoms. It was later found that his development of Parkinson's was due to a common impurity in the synthesis of MPPP called [[MPTP|MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)]], a neurotoxin that specifically targets dopamine producing neurons.<ref name=Schwarcz /><ref name=Gibb>Gibb, Barry J.
