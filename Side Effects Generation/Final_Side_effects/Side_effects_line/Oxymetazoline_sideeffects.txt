If accidentally ingested, standard methods to remove unabsorbed drugs should be considered.{{clarify|date=December 2016}} There is no specific antidote for oxymetazoline, although its pharmacological effects may be reversed by α adrenergic antagonists such as [[phentolamine]]. In the event of a possibly life-threatening overdose (such as a [[hypertensive crisis]]), [[benzodiazepines]] should be considered to decrease the likelihood of [[seizures]] and [[convulsions]], as well as reduce anxiety and to lower blood pressure. In children, oxymetazoline may produce profound central nervous system depression due to stimulation of central α<sub>2</sub> receptors and [[imidazoline receptor]]s, much like [[clonidine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

 
Oxymetazoline is a [[sympathomimetic]] that selectively agonizes [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] and, partially, [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]] [[adrenergic receptor]]s.<ref name="adrenomimetic">Westfall Thomas C, Westfall David P, "Chapter 6.

In addition, the local application of the drug also results in vasoconstriction due to its action on endothelial postsynaptic α<sub>2</sub> receptors; systemic application of α<sub>2</sub> agonists, in contrast, causes [[vasodilation]] because of centrally-mediated inhibition of sympathetic tone via presynaptic α<sub>2</sub> receptors.<ref name="alpha">Biaggioni Italo, Robertson David, "Chapter 9.

Imidazolines are sympathomimetic agents, with primary effects on α adrenergic receptors and little if any effect on [[Adrenergic receptor#.CE.B2 receptors|β adrenergic receptors]]. Oxymetazoline is readily absorbed orally. Effects on α receptors from systemically absorbed oxymetazoline hydrochloride may persist for up to 7 hours after a single dose. The elimination half-life in humans is 5–8 hours. It is excreted unchanged both by the kidneys (30%) and in feces (10%).
