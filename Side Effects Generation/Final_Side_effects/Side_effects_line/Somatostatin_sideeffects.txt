Somatostatin released in the [[pyloric antrum]] travels via the portal venous system to the heart, then enters the systemic circulation to reach the locations where it will exert its inhibitory effects. In addition, somatostatin release from delta cells can act in a [[paracrine]] manner.<ref name="isbn9781437717532"/>

 
Somatostatin is produced by [[neuroendocrine]] neurons of the [[ventromedial nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]]. These neurons project to the [[median eminence]], where somatostatin is released from neurosecretory nerve endings into the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypothalamo-hypophysial system]] through neuron axons. Somatostatin is then carried to the [[anterior pituitary gland]], where it inhibits the secretion of [[growth hormone]] from [[somatotrope]] cells. The somatostatin neurons in the periventricular nucleus mediate negative feedback effects of [[growth hormone]] on its own release; the somatostatin neurons respond to high circulating concentrations of [[growth hormone]] and [[somatomedin]]s by increasing the release of somatostatin, so reducing the rate of secretion of [[growth hormone]].

 
In the [[anterior pituitary gland]], the effects of somatostatin are:
