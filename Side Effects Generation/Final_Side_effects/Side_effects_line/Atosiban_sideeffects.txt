A 2014 systematic review by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] showed that while atosiban had fewer side effects than alternative drugs (such as [[ritodrine]]), other beta blockers, calcium channel antagonists, it was no better than [[placebo]] in the major outcomes i.e. pregnancy prolongation or neonatal outcomes. The finding of an increase in infant deaths in one placebo controlled trial warrants caution. Further research is recommended.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Flenady|first=Vicki|last2=Reinebrant|first2=Hanna E.|last3=Liley|first3=Helen G.|last4=Tambimuttu|first4=Eashan G.|last5=Papatsonis|first5=Dimitri N.

Recently published a retrospective study (Saleh SS. ''et al.'', 2013) comparing the efficacy and safety of atosiban and [[nifedipine]] in the suppression of pre-term labour concluded that atosiban and nifedipine are effective in delaying delivery for 7 days or more in women presenting with pre-term labour. A total of 68.3% of women in the atosiban group remained undelivered at 7 days or more, compared with 64.7% in the nifedipine group. They have the same efficacy and associated minor side-effects. However, flushing, palpitation and hypotension were significantly higher in the nifedipine group.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Saleh | first1 = SS | last2 = Al-Ramahi | first2 = MQ | last3 = Al Kazaleh | first3 = FA | date = Jan 2013 | title = Atosiban and nifedipine in the suppression of pre-term labour: a comparative study | url = | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 43–5 | doi = 10.3109/01443615.2012.721822 }}</ref>

 
A randomised controlled study (de Heus R. ''et al.'', 2009) demonstrated for the first time the direct effects of atosiban on fetal movement, heart rate, and blood flow. Tocolysis with either atosiban or nifedipine combined with betamethasone administration have no direct fetal adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = De Heus | first1 = R | last2 = Mulder | first2 = EJ | last3 = Derks | first3 = JB | last4 = Visser | first4 = GH | date = Jun 2009 | title = The effects of thetocolytics atosiban and nifedipine on fetal movements, heart rate and bloodflow | url = | journal = J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. | volume = 22 | issue = 6| pages = 485–90 | doi = 10.1080/14767050802702349 }}</ref>
