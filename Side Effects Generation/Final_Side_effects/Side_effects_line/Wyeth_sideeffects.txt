In 1943, AHP merged with ''Ayerst, McKenna and Harrison, Ltd.'' of Canada. With this merger came [[Premarin]], the world's first conjugated [[estrogen]] medicine, which was a flagship product for AHP until 2002, when preliminary results from the [[Women's Health Initiative]] linked it to a number of negative effects, including increased risk for breast cancer.
