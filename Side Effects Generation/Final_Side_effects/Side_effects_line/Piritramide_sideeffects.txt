'''Piritramide''' ('''R-3365''', trade names '''Dipidolor''', '''Piridolan''', '''Pirium''' and others) is a synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] (narcotic painkiller) that is marketed in certain [[Europe]]an countries including: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Piritramide|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=23 September 2011|editor=Brayfield, A|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/6259-x.htm}}</ref> It comes in free form, is about 0.75x times as potent as [[morphine]] and is given [[parenterally]] (by injection) for the treatment of severe pain.<ref name = MD/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=B|title=A clinical investigation of piritramide in the treatment of postoperative pain.|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|date=December 1971|volume=43|issue=12|pages=1167–71|doi=10.1093/bja/43.12.1167|pmid=4945251}}</ref> Nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression and constipation are believed to be less frequent with piritramide than with [[morphine]] (the gold standard opioid against which other opioids are compared and contrasted), and it produces more rapid-onset analgesia (pain relief) when compared to morphine and [[pethidine]]. After intravenous administration the onset of analgesia is as little as 1–2 minutes, which may be related to its great [[lipophilicity]].<ref name = SPC>{{cite web|title=FACHINFORMATION (Zusammenfassung der Merkmale des Arzneimittels)|trans_title=PROFESSIONAL INFORMATION (Summary of Product Characteristics)|work=Janssen|publisher=Janssen - Cilag Pharma GmbH|format=PDF|url=http://www.janssen-medinfo.at/sites/janssen_medinfo_at/themes/medinfo_at/images/Dipidolor_FI_20131206.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2014|date=November 2013}}</ref> The analgesic and sedative effects of piritramide are believed to be potentiated with phenothiazines and its emetic (nausea/vomiting-inducing) effects are suppressed.<ref name = SPC/> The [[volume of distribution]] is 0.7-1 L/kg after a single dose, 4.7-6 L/kg after steady-state concentrations are achieved and up to 11.1 L/kg after prolonged dosing.<ref name = SPC/>
