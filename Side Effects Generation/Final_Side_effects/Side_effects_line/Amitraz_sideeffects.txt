These can be traced back to the mechanisms of action, which lead to a wide field of effects, including direct [[lethality]], excitant-repellant behavioral effects, and chemosterilization for the target species.<ref name=Hollingworth/> In addition, it generally causes low damage to nontarget species, which is one of the advantages of amitraz. Furthermore, amitraz is especially effective against insects such as [[spider mite]]s and [[tick]]s in their juvenile and resistant forms.<ref name=Hollingworth>Hollingworth, R. M. (1976). Chemistry, biological activity, and uses of formamidine pesticides. Environmental Health Perspectives, 14(April), 57-69</ref>

 
Other animal species &mdash; horses or Chihuahuas, for example &mdash; should not be treated with amitraz because adverse effects may occur.<ref name=Peter/><ref name=Tarallo/>

 
== Adverse effects ==

 
Adverse effects in mammals are caused by amitraz' alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. Symptoms can include low blood pressure and pulse, hypothermia, lethargy, absence of appetite, vomiting, increased blood sugar and digestive problems.<ref name=Peter /><ref name=Tarallo /><ref name=Grossman >Grossman M.R. Amitraz toxicosis associated with ingestion of an acaricide collar in a dog. J Am Vet Med Assoc, 1993, 203(1), 55-7</ref>  Furthermore, skin- or [[mucosa]]-irritations may occur in dogs as a response to an amitraz containing collar. This can lead to itching, eczema, [[alopecia]] or [[conjunctivitis]].<ref name=Peter/><ref name=Grossman/>

 
The toxic effects to humans following on amitraz-uptake include  loss of consciousness, vomiting, respiratory failure, [[miosis]], [[hypothermia]], [[bradycardia]], [[hyperglycemia]] and [[central nervous system depression]].<ref name=Bonsall/>

 
The pharmacological activity of amitraz includes different mechanisms of action leading to toxic effects in humans as well as in animals.

 
Many of these effects and most of the effects on humans are caused by its [[alpha-adrenergic agonist]] activity.<ref name=Bonsall/> Furthermore, amitraz inhibits  [[prostaglandin]] synthesis, interacts with the [[octopamine (neurotransmitter)|octopamine]] receptors of the central nervous system and inhibits  [[monoamine oxidase]]s.<ref name=Bonsall/>

 
Animal studies revealed that damages due to amitraz poisoning can be recovered even after exposure to a potentially [[lethal dose]]. This could mean that amitraz' effects are reversible or at least are recoverable.<ref name=Agin>Agin, H., Calkavur, S., Uzun, H., & Bak, M. (2004). Amitraz poisoning: clinical and laboratory findings. Indian Pediatrics, 41(5), 482-486</ref>

 
Amitraz is a central alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist.<ref name=Ellenhorn /> That means that it selectively stimulates [[alpha adrenergic receptor]]s, which are metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors, that are usually targeted by [[catecholamines]]. Stimulating these receptors is in great extent the reason for the neurotoxic and preconvulsant effects of amitraz.<ref name=Chen>Chen-Izu, Y., Xiao, R. P., Izu, L. T., Cheng, H., Kuschel, M., Spurgeon, H., & Lakatta, E. G. (2000). G(i)-dependent localization of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor signaling to L-type Ca(2+) channels. Biophysical Journal, 79(5), 2547–2556</ref> Xylene present in amitraz formulations additionally induces [[central nervous system depression]].<ref name=Bonsall/>

 
Besides the neurotoxic effects other clinical effects  observed in amitraz poisoning are related to alpha2-adrenergic agonistic activity.<ref name=PubChem24868774/> [[Adrenergic receptors]] are present in many different cells. The activation of these receptors by an [[agonist]] as amitraz generally induces a [[sympathetic response]]. This leads to an increased heart rate, dilation of the pupils, elevation of blood pressure and blood and energy supply focus on skeletal muscles.<ref name=Ellenhorn />

 
Like other formamidines amitraz inhibits the synthesis of [[prostaglandin E2]] from [[arachidonic acid]] by bovine seminal vesicle microsomes.<ref name=Yim>Yim, G. K., Holsapple, M. P., Pfister, W. R., & Hollingworth, R. M. (1978). Prostaglandin synthesis inhibited by formamidine pesticides. Life Sciences, 23(25), 2509–2515</ref>  In a dose of 5 to 80&nbsp;mg/kg body weight, given intraperitoneally to rats, amitraz reduces yeast-onduces fever and antagonizes the carageenin-induced swelling of the hind paw.<ref name=Yim/>  Some of the physiological effects of amitraz probably go back to this aspirin-like activity and occur due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.<ref name=Agin />
