===Radiation side-effects===

 
Several radiopharmaceuticals and radionuclides may be used for this, each giving different information. In the myocardial perfusion scans using Tc-99m, the radiopharmaceuticals <sup>99m</sup>Tc-[[tetrofosmin]] (Myoview, [[GE Healthcare]]) or <sup>99m</sup>Tc-[[sestamibi]] (Cardiolite, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]) are used. Following this, myocardial stress is induced, either by exercise or pharmacologically with [[adenosine]], [[dobutamine]] or [[dipyridamole]](Persantine), which increase the heart rate or by [[regadenoson]](Lexiscan), a vasodilator. ([[Aminophylline]] can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole and regadenoson). Scanning may then be performed with a conventional gamma camera, or with SPECT/CT.
