Although never given a general release, it was trialled and  50mg codeine â‰ˆ 60mg phenampromide. Tests on the 2 isomers showed that all of the analgesic effects were caused by the (S) isomer. In the book <ref>Opioids - R.Lenz et all</ref> a 4-benzyl group added to the piperidine-ring produces a drug some x60 morphine. When overlaid with the most potent isomer of [[3-methylfentanyl]], the 2 compounds overlay perfectly. This is of academic interest only since the synthetic complexity is beyond clandestine drug manufacturers.

 
Phenampromide produces similar effects to other opioids, including [[analgesia]], [[sedation]], [[dizziness]] and [[nausea]].
