'''Pimozide''' (sold under the brand name '''Orap''') is an [[antipsychotic]] [[medication|drug]] of the [[diphenylbutylpiperidine]] class. It was discovered at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1963. It has a high potency compared to [[chlorpromazine]] (ratio 50-70:1). On a weight basis it is even more potent than [[haloperidol]]. It also has special neurologic indications for [[Tourette syndrome]] and resistant [[tics]]. The side effects include [[akathisia]], [[tardive dyskinesia]], and, more rarely, [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] and prolongation of the [[QT interval]].

Similarly to other typical antipsychotics pimozide has a high affinity for the [[Dopamine D2 receptor|Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] and this likely results in its sexual (due to [[Hyperprolactinaemia|prolactin hypersecretion]]) and extrapyramidal side effects as well as its therapeutic efficacy against the positive symptoms of [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="Maudsley">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-470-97948-8 | title = The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry | last1 = Taylor | first1 = D |author2=Paton, C; Shitij, K | year = 2012 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = West Sussex  | pages =  }}</ref>

 
| [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] || 48.4 || This receptor is believed to be responsible for the atypicality of other antipsychotics like [[clozapine]], [[olanzapine]] and [[quetiapine]]. Pimozide's affinity towards this receptor is low compared to its affinity for the D<sub>2</sub> receptor and hence this receptor unlikely contributes to its effects to any meaningful extent.

 
| [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub>]] || 0.5 || Relatively high affinity for this receptor may explain its supposed antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Anti-depressant like Effect of Pimozide in Acute and Chronic Animal  Models of Depression|journal=Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research|volume=45|issue=1|pages=46–53|date=January–March 2011|url=http://www.ijperonline.com/jan_mar_2011/49-56.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

 
| [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M<sub>3</sub>]] || 1,955 || This receptor is believed to be responsible for the interference with glucose [[homeostasis]] seen with some of the [[atypical antipsychotics]] such as [[clozapine]] and [[olanzapine]].<ref name="GG">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-07-162442-8 | title = [[Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] | edition = 12th |author1=Brunton, L |author2=Chabner, B |author3=Knollman, B | year = 2010 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | location = New York }}</ref> Pimozide's low affinity for this receptor likely contributes to the comparatively mild effects on glucose homeostasis.

 
| [[Dopamine D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]] || 0.33 || Likely the receptor responsible for the therapeutic effects against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia of antipsychotics like pimozide as well as the prolactin-elevating and extrapyramidal side effect-generating effects of typical antipsychotics like pimozide.<ref name = GG/>
