'''Dextrorphan''' ('''DXO''') is a [[psychoactive drug]] of the [[morphinan]] class which acts as an [[antitussive]] or [[cough suppressant]] and [[dissociative drug|dissociative]] [[hallucinogen]]. It is the [[dextrorotatory]]-[[stereoisomer]] of [[racemorphan]], the [[Levorotation|levo]]-half being [[levorphanol]]. Dextrorphan is produced by O-demethylation of [[dextromethorphan]] by [[CYP2D6]]. Dextrorphan is an [[NMDA receptor antagonist|NMDA antagonist]] and contributes to the psychoactive effects of dextromethorphan.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zawertailo | first1 = L.

The pharmacology of dextrorphan is similar to that of [[dextromethorphan]] (DXM). However, dextrorphan is much more potent as an NMDA receptor antagonist as well much less active as a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]], but retains DXM's activity as a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]].<ref>{{ cite journal | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/309/2/515.full.pdf | format = pdf | title = Comparison of the Effects of Dextromethorphan, Dextrorphan, and Levorphanol on the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis |author1=Pechnick, R.
