Ropinirole is prescribed for mainly [[Parkinson's disease]], RLS and [[extrapyramidal symptoms]]. It can also reduce the side effects caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Parkinsonism syndrome as well as [[sexual dysfunction]] and [[erectile dysfunction]] caused by either [[SSRI]]s<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00334048}} - "Treating Sexual Dysfunction From SSRI Medication: a Study Comparing Requip CR to Placebo"</ref> or antipsychotics.

 
Ropinirole is metabolized primarily by [[cytochrome P450]] [[CYP1A2]] to form two [[metabolites]]; SK&F-104557 and SK&F-89124, both of which are renally excreted,<ref name="RPL">[http://www.richmondpharmacology.com/downloads/Publications/L3%20MDS%20ESRD%20poster.pdf An open-label, parallel-group, repeat-dose study to investigate the effects of end-stage renal disease and haemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ropinirole] | Authors: Debra J.

At doses greater than 24&nbsp;mg, [[CYP2D6]] may be inhibited, although this has only been tested [[in vitro]].<ref name=TompsonD/>

 
== Side effects ==

 
Ropinirole can cause nausea, dizziness, hallucinations, [[orthostatic hypotension]], and sudden sleep attacks during the daytime. Unusual side effects specific to D<sub>3</sub> agonists such as ropinirole and [[pramipexole]] can include [[hypersexuality]], [[punding]] and [[compulsive gambling]], even in patients without a history of these behaviours.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.4065/84.4.310 |vauthors=Bostwick JM, Hecksel KA, Stevens SR, Bower JH, Ahlskog JE | title= Frequency of new-onset pathologic compulsive gambling or hypersexuality after drug treatment of idiopathic Parkinson disease |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings| volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=310–6 | year=2009 | pmid= 19339647 | pmc=2665974 }}</ref>
