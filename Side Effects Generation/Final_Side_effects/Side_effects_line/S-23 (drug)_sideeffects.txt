'''S-23''' is an investigational [[selective androgen receptor modulator]] (SARM) developed by [[Gtx inc|GTX, Inc]] as a potential [[male contraceptive|male]] [[hormonal contraceptive]]. It binds to the [[androgen receptor]] more strongly than older drugs such as [[andarine]] with a [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|K<sub>i</sub>]] of 1.7&nbsp;nM, and in animal studies it showed both a good ratio of [[anabolic]] to [[androgen]]ic effects, and dose-dependent suppression of [[spermatogenesis]] with spontaneous recovery after cessation of treatment.<ref>Marhefka CA, Gao W, Chung K, Kim J, He Y, Yin D, Bohl C, Dalton JT, Miller DD.
