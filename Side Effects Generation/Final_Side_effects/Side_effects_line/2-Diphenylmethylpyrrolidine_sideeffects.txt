'''2-Diphenylmethylpyrrolidine''' ('''Desoxy-D2PM'''), also known as '''2-benzhydrylpyrrolidine''', is a [[stimulant]] [[psychoactive drug]]. It is the 4-dehydroxylated [[structural analog]] of [[diphenylprolinol]] (D2PM), and is also similar in structure to [[desoxypipradrol]] (2-DPMP), both of which act as [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NDRIs). Like D2PM and 2-DPMP, Desoxy-D2PM is sold as a [[designer drug]] and has been used in the manufacture of [[legal high]]s. It has been marketed under the names '''A3A New Generation''', '''A3A Methano''', and '''Green Powder''', and has been reported to cause hallucinations, violent behavior, dilated pupils, tachycardia, and high blood pressure.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = De Paoli | first1 = G. | last2 = Brandt | first2 = S.
