Latrepirdine is an orally active, small molecule compound that has been shown to inhibit brain cell death in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and [[Huntington's disease]]. Research suggests it may also have cognition-enhancing effects in healthy individuals, in the absence of neurodegenerative disease pathology.<ref name="pmid11462798">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bachurin S, Bukatina E, Lermontova N, Tkachenko S, Afanasiev A, Grigoriev V, Grigorieva I, Ivanov Y, Sablin S, Zefirov N | title = Antihistamine agent Dimebon as a novel neuroprotector and a cognition enhancer | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=June 2001 | volume = 939  | issue = |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03654.x| pages = 425–435 | pmid = 11462798}}</ref> However, because of negative results in human clinical trials, the drug remains unlicensed for any neurodegenerative condition.<ref name=medpagetoday /><ref name=HD/>

 
Latrepirdine attracted renewed interest in 2009 after being shown in small preclinical trials to have positive effects on persons suffering from [[Alzheimer's]] disease. Animal studies showing potential beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease models were shown in Russian research in 2000.<ref name="pmid11022244">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lermontova NN, Lukoyanov NV, Serkova TP, Lukoyanova EA, Bachurin SO | title = Dimebon improves learning in animals with experimental Alzheimer's disease | journal = Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=June 2000 | volume = 129 | issue = 6 | pages = 544–546 | pmid = 11022244 | doi=10.1007/BF02434871}}</ref> Preliminary results from human trials have also been promising.
