=== Neuroprotective effects ===

 
The neuroprotective effects exhibited by citicoline may be due to its preservation of [[cardiolipin]] and [[sphingomyelin]], preservation of [[arachidonic acid]] content of [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], partial restoration of [[phosphatidylcholine]] levels, and stimulation of [[glutathione]] synthesis and [[glutathione reductase]] activity. Citicoline’s effects may also be explained by the reduction of [[phospholipase A2]] activity.<ref name="Adibhatla 2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Adibhatla RM, Hatcher JF, Dempsey RJ | title = Citicoline: neuroprotective mechanisms in cerebral ischemia | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 | date = Jan 2002 | pmid = 11796739 | doi = 10.1046/j.0022-3042.2001.00697.x }}</ref> 

 
The brain prefers to use [[choline]] to synthesize [[acetylcholine]]. This limits the amount of [[choline]] available to synthesize [[phosphatidylcholine]]. When the availability of [[choline]] is low or the need for [[acetylcholine]] increases, phospholipids containing [[choline]] can be catabolized from neuronal membranes. These phospholipids include sphingomyelin and [[phosphatidylcholine]].<ref name="Adibhatla 2002" /> Supplementation with citicoline can increase the amount of [[choline]] available for [[acetylcholine]] synthesis and aid in rebuilding membrane [[phospholipid]] stores after depletion.<ref name="D’Orlando 1995">{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Orlando KJ, Sandage BW | title = Citicoline (CDP-choline): mechanisms of action and effects in ischemic brain injury | journal = Neurological Research | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 281–4 | date = Aug 1995 | pmid = 7477743 }}</ref> 

 
Citicoline lowers increased [[glutamate]] concentrations and raises decreased [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] concentrations induced by [[ischemia]]. Citicoline also increases [[glutamate]] uptake by increasing expression of [[EAAT2]], a [[glutamate transporter]], in vitro in rat astrocytes. It is suggested that the neuroprotective effects of citicoline after a [[stroke]] are due in part to citicoline’s ability to decrease levels of [[glutamate]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurtado O, Moro MA, Cárdenas A, Sánchez V, Fernández-Tomé P, Leza JC, Lorenzo P, Secades JJ, Lozano R, Dávalos A, Castillo J, Lizasoain I | title = Neuroprotection afforded by prior citicoline administration in experimental brain ischemia: effects on glutamate transport | journal = Neurobiology of Disease | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 336–345 | date = Mar 2005 | pmid = 15686962 | doi = 10.1016/j.nbd.2004.10.006 }}</ref>

 
=== Side effects ===

 
Citicoline has a very low toxicity profile in animals and humans. Clinically, doses of 2000&nbsp;mg per day have been observed and approved. Minor transient adverse effects are rare and most commonly include stomach pain and diarrhea.<ref name="Conant 2004" />
