Tafamidis functions by kinetic stabilization of the correctly folded [[tetrameric]] form of the [[transthyretin]] (TTR) protein.<ref>Hammarstrom, P.; Wiseman, R. L.; Powers, E.T.; Kelly, J.W. "Prevention of Transthyretin Amyloid Disease by Changing Protein Misfolding Energetics". ''Science'', 2003, 299, 713-716</ref> In patients with FAP, this protein dissociates in a process that is rate limiting for aggregation including [[amyloid]] fibril formation, causing failure of the autonomic nervous system and/or the peripheral nervous system ([[neurodegeneration]]) initially and later failure of the heart. Kinetic Stabilization of tetrameric transthyretin in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients provides the first pharmacologic evidence that the process of amyloid fibril formation causes this disease, as treatment with tafamidis dramatically slows the process of amyloid fibril formation and the degeneration of post-mitotic tissue. Sixty % of the patients enrolled in the initial clinical trial have the same or an improved neurologic impairment score after six years of taking tafamidis, whereas 30% of the patients progress at a rate ≤ 1/5 of that predicted by the natural history. Importantly, all of the V30M FAP patients remain stage 1 patients after 6 years on tafamidis out of four stages of disease progression.

The process of wild type transthyretin amyloidogenesis also appears to cause [[wild-type transthyretin amyloid]]osis (WTTA), also known as senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), leading to [[cardiomyopathy]] as the prominent phenotype.<ref>Westermark, P., Sletten, K., Johansson, B., and Cornwell, G.G., 3rd (1990). "Fibril in senile systemic amyloidosis is derived from normal transthyretin". ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A'', 87, 2843-2845.</ref> Some mutants of transthyretin — including V122I, which is primarily found in individuals of African descent — are destabilizing, enabling heterotetramer dissociation, monomer misfolding, and subsequent misassembly of transthyretin into a variety of aggregate structures <ref>Sousa, M.M., Cardoso, I., Fernandes, R., Guimaraes, A., and Saraiva, M.J.

''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', 336, 466-473.</ref> While there is clinical evidence from a small number of patients that tafamidis slows the progression of the transthyretin cardiomyopathies,<ref>Maurer, M.S.; Grogan, D.R.; Judge, D.P.; Mundayat, R.; Lombardo, I.; Quyyumi, A.A.; Aarts, J.; Falk, R.H.

Fail.]]'' 2015 8, 519-526.</ref> this has yet to be demonstrated in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Pfizer has enrolled a placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the ability of tafamidis to slow the progression of both [[familial amyloid cardiomyopathy]] and [[Wild-type transthyretin amyloid|senile systemic amyloidosis]]  (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01994889).
