'''Sulprostone''' is an analogue of [[prostaglandin E2]] (PGE<sub>2</sub>) that has [[oxytocic]] activity in assays of rat kidney cells and tissues.<ref name="pmid12829746">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Tamma G, Wiesner B, Furkert J, etal |title=The prostaglandin E2 analogue sulprostone antagonizes vasopressin-induced antidiuresis through activation of Rho |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=116 |issue=Pt 16 |pages=3285–94 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12829746 |doi=10.1242/jcs.00640 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12829746}}</ref> There are four known receptors which mediate various but often different cellular and tissue responses to PGE<sub>2</sub>: [[prostaglandin EP1 receptor]], [[prostaglandin EP2 receptor]], [[prostaglandin EP3 receptor]], and [[prostaglandin EP4 receptor]]. Sulprosotone binds to and activates the [[prostaglandin EP3 receptor]] with far greater efficacy than the other PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors and also has the advantage of being relatively resistant, compared with PGE<sub>2</sub>, to becoming metabolically degraded. It is listed as a comparatively weak [[receptor agonist]] of the prostaglandin EP1 receptor. In all events, this as well as other potent synthetic EP<sub>3</sub> [[receptor antagonist]]s have the realized or potential ability to promote the beneficial effects of prostaglandin EP3 receptor activation.<ref name="pmid27940058">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreno JJ | title = Eicosanoid receptors: Targets for the treatment of disrupted intestinal epithelial homeostasis | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 796 | issue = | pages = 7–19 | year = 2017 | pmid = 27940058 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.12.004 | url = }}</ref>
