Prochlorperazine is thought to exert its [[antipsychotic]] effects by blocking [[dopamine receptor]]s.<ref>Manuchair S. Ebadi, Desk reference of clinical pharmacology. 2007</ref>

 
Prochlorperazine is analogous to [[chlorpromazine]], both of these agents antagonize dopaminergic [[dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s in various pathways of the [[central nervous system]]. This D<sub>2</sub> blockade results in antipsychotic, [[antiemetic]] and other effects. [[Hyperprolactinaemia]] is a side effect of [[dopamine antagonist]]s as blockade of D<sub>2</sub> receptors within the [[tuberoinfundibular pathway]] results in increased plasma levels of [[prolactin]] due to increased secretion by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary.
