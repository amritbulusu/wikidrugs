The approach that lead to [[drug development|development]] of the J147 drug was to screen candidate molecules for [[life extension|anti-aging]] effects, instead of targeting the [[amyloid plaques]]. It is contrary to most other approaches to developing drugs against Alzheimer's disease that target the plaque deposits in the [[brain]].<ref name="NextBigFuture_Experimental_drug">{{cite web |url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2015/11/experimental-drug-targeting-alzheimers.html |title=Experimental drug targeting Alzheimer's disease shows anti-aging effects in animal tests |website=nextbigfuture.com |date=13 November 2015 |author=Brian L.
