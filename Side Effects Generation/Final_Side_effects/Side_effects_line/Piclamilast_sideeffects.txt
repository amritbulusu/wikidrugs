It has been investigated for its applications to the treatment of conditions such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] and [[asthma]]. It is a second generation compound that exhibits structural functionalities of the PDE4 inhibitors [[cilomilast]] and [[roflumilast]]. The structure for piclamilast was first elucidated in a 1995 European patent application.<ref>{{Cite patent|EP|0497564|application}}</ref> The earliest mention of the name "piclamilast" was used in a 1997 publication.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  | year = 1997 | title = Evidence that cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors suppress interleukin-2 release from murine splenocytes by interacting with a 'low-affinity' phosphodiesterase 4 conformer | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pmid = 9208143| pages = 743–750 | url =  

 
== Side effects ==

 
[[Vomiting]] is the most commonly cited [[side effect]] of piclamilast. It has proven difficult to separate the emetic side effects from the therapeutic benefits of several PDE4 inhibitors, including piclamilast.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  | year = 2007 | title = Correlation between emetic effect of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors and their occupation of the high-affinity rolipram binding site in Suncus murinus brain | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 573 | issue = 1–3 | pmid = 17658510| pages = 93–99 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.06.045 | last1 = Hirose | first1 = R. | last2 = Manabe | first2 = H. | last3 = Nonaka | first3 = H. | last4 = Yanagawa | first4 = K. | last5 = Akuta | first5 = K. | last6 = Sato | first6 = S. | last7 = Ohshima | first7 = E. | last8 = Ichimura | first8 = M. }}</ref>
