Tildren is administered intravenously. It is labeled for 0.1&nbsp;mg/kg dosing, once daily for 10 days by slow intravenous injection, which for a 500&nbsp;kg horse works out to be 1 vial per day. However, one study giving all 10 doses at once (1&nbsp;mg/kg IV as a single CRI) was found to have the same pharmacological effects, and is used clinically.<ref>DELGUSTE, C., AMORY, H., GUYONNET, J., THIBAUD, D., GARNERO, P., DETILLEUX, J., LEPAGE, O. M. and DOUCET, M. (2008), Comparative pharmacokinetics of two intravenous administration regimens of tiludronate in healthy adult horses and effects on the bone resorption marker CTX-1. Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 31: 108–116. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2885.2007.00936</ref> It may be given systemically or locally, by [[limb perfusion|regional limb perfusion]]. Although RLP is thought to have certain benefits, including decreased cost and reduced risk of adverse effects, some diseases must be treated systemically, such as osteoarthritis of the vertebral column. Systemic administration is often given by adding a 1&nbsp;mg/kg dose into a 1 liter fluid bag, which is slowly given over 60–90 minutes. Its effects are reported to last 4 months or longer, with a peak effect 6–8 weeks post treatment.<ref name="AAEP">Allen KA, Johns S, Hyman SS, Sislak MD, Davis S, Amory J. How to Diagnose and Treat Back Pain in the Horse. Proc. AAEP. Vol 56: 384-388</ref> The effects of regional limb perfusion has come into question due to in vitro studies showing that high doses given by RLP or intraarticular injection may damage articular cartilage by chondrocyte apoptosis.<ref>Duesterdieck-Zellmer KF, Driscoll N, Ott JF.
