Niaprazine has been shown to [[metabolize]] to the compound [[para-Fluorophenylpiperazine|''p''FPP]] in a similar manner to how [[trazodone]] and [[nefazodone]] metabolize to [[meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine|''m''CPP]].<ref name="pmid6460945">{{cite journal |vauthors=Keane PE, Strolin Benedetti M, Dow J | title = The effect of niaprazine on the turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat brain | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–9 |date=February 1982 | pmid = 6460945 | doi = 10.1016/0028-3908(82)90157-5| url = }}</ref><ref name="isbn0-12-366829-8">{{Cite book | title = International review of neurobiology | year = 1988 | publisher = Academic Press | location = New York  | isbn = 0-12-366829-8 | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Uf_BWXKXW2cC&lpg=PA274&dq=niaprazine&pg=PA274#v=onepage&q}}</ref> It is unclear what role, if any, ''p''FPP plays in the clinical effects of niaprazine.<ref name="pmid2853885" /> However, from animal studies it is known that ''p''FPP, unlike niaprazine, does not produce sedative effects, and instead exerts a behavioral profile indicative of [[serotonergic]] activation.<ref name="pmid6460945" />
