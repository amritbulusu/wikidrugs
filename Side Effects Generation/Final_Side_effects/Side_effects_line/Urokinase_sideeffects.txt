Elevated [[gene expression|expression]] levels of urokinase and several other components of the [[plasminogen activation system]] are found to be correlated with [[tumor]] [[malignancy]]. It is believed that the tissue degradation following plasminogen activation facilitates tissue invasion and, thus, contributes to [[metastasis]]. This makes urokinase an attractive [[drug target]], and, so, [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s have been sought to be used as anticancer agents.<ref name="pmid10738907">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jankun J, Skrzypczak-Jankun E | title = Molecular basis of specific inhibition of urokinase plasminogen activator by amiloride | journal = Cancer Biochem.

Through its interaction with the [[urokinase receptor]], urokinase affects several other aspects of cancer biology such as cell adhesion, migration, and cellular [[mitotic]] pathways.
