Research on idebenone as a potential therapy of [[Alzheimer's disease]] have been inconsistent, but there may be a trend for a slight benefit.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11819153|year=2002|last1=Gutzmann|first1=H|last2=Kühl|first2=KP|last3=Hadler|first3=D|last4=Rapp|first4=MA|title=Safety and efficacy of idebenone versus tacrine in patients with Alzheimer's disease: results of a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter study.|volume=35|issue=1|pages=12–8|doi=10.1055/s-2002-19833|journal=Pharmacopsychiatry}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2165/00003495-199753050-00003|pmid=9129864|year=1997|last1=Parnetti|first1=L|last2=Senin|first2=U|last3=Mecocci|first3=P|title=Cognitive enhancement therapy for Alzheimer's disease.

Preliminary testing has been done in humans and found idebenone to be a safe treatment for Friedreich's ataxia (FA), exhibiting a positive effect on [[cardiac hypertrophy]] and neurological function.<ref name="pmid17826341">{{cite journal |vauthors=Di Prospero NA, Baker A, Jeffries N, Fischbeck KH |title=Neurological effects of high-dose idebenone in patients with Friedreich's ataxia: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=878–86 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17826341 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70220-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474-4422(07)70220-X}}</ref> The latter was only significantly improved in young patients.<ref name="pmid18710357">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tonon C, Lodi R |title=Idebenone in Friedreich's ataxia |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=9 |issue=13 |pages=2327–37 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18710357 |doi=10.1517/14656566.9.13.2327 }}</ref> In a different experiment, a one-year test on eight patients, idebenone reduced the rate of deterioration of cardiac function, but without halting the progression of [[ataxia]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Buyse G, Mertens L, Di Salvo G, etal |title=Idebenone treatment in Friedreich's ataxia: neurological, cardiac, and biochemical monitoring |journal=Neurology |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=1679–81 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12771265 |doi= 10.1212/01.wnl.0000068549.52812.0f|url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12771265}}</ref>

 
In cellular and tissue models, idebenone acts as a transporter in the [[electron transport chain]] of [[mitochondria]] and thus increases the production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) which is the main energy source for cells, and also inhibits [[lipoperoxide]] formation. Positive effects on the energy household of mitochondria has also been observed in animal models.<ref name="CHMP" /><ref name="pmid3410376">{{cite journal |vauthors=Suno M, Nagaoka A |title=[Effect of idebenone and various nootropic drugs on lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenate in the presence of succinate] |language=Japanese |journal=Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=295–9 |date=May 1988 |pmid=3410376 |doi= 10.1254/fpj.91.295|url=}}</ref> Clinical relevance of these findings has not been established.
