The antihypertensive effects of teprotide were first observed by Sergio Ferreira in 1965 <ref>{{cite journal|last=Ferreira|first=Sergio|title=A bradykinin-potentiating factor (bpf) present in the venom of bothrops jararaca|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=February 1965|volume=24|pages=169-169|pmc=1704050|pmid=14302350|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1965.tb02091.x}}</ref>   and it was first isolated by Ferreira ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ferreira|first=Sergio H.|author2=Diana C.
