Levomethorphan is a [[prodrug]] to [[levorphanol]], analogously to DXM acting as a prodrug to [[dextrorphan]] or [[codeine]] behaving as a prodrug to [[morphine]].<ref name="GudinFudin2015">{{cite journal|last1=Gudin|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Fudin|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Nalamachu|first3=Srinivas|title=Levorphanol use: past, present and future|journal=Postgraduate Medicine|volume=128|issue=1|year=2015|pages=46–53|issn=0032-5481|doi=10.1080/00325481.2016.1128308}}</ref> As such, levomethorphan has similar effects to levorphanol but is less potent as it must be demethylated to the active form by [[liver]] [[enzyme]]s before being able to produce its effects.<ref name="GudinFudin2015" /> As a prodrug of levorphanol, levomethorphan functions as a potent [[agonist]] of all three of the [[opioid receptor]]s, [[μ-opioid receptor|μ]], [[κ-opioid receptor|κ]] (κ<sub>1</sub> and κ<sub>3</sub> but notably not κ<sub>2</sub>), and [[δ-opioid receptor|δ]], as an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]], and as a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]].<ref name="GudinFudin2015" /> Via activation of the KOR, levomethorphan can produce [[dysphoria]] and [[psychotomimetic]] effects such as [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] and [[hallucination]]s.<ref name="BrueraPortenoy2009">{{cite book|author1=Eduardo D.
