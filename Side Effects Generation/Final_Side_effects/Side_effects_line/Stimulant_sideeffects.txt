Stimulants in therapeutic doses, such as those given to patients with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], increases ability to focus, vigor, sociability, libido and may elevate mood.  However, in higher doses stimulants may actually decrease the ability to focus, a principle of the [[Yerkes-Dodson Law]].  In higher doses stimulants may also produce euphoria, vigor, and decrease need for sleep.  Many, but not all, stimulants have [[ergogenic]] effects.  Drugs such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine and methylphenidate have well documented ergogenic effects, while drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine have the opposite effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Avois|first1=L|last2=Robinson|first2=N|last3=Saudan|first3=C|last4=Baume|first4=N|last5=Mangin|first5=P|last6=Saugy|first6=M|title=Central nervous system stimulants and sport practice|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|date=7 January 2017|volume=40|issue=Suppl 1|pages=i16–i20|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.027557|pmc=2657493|issn=0306-3674}}</ref>  Neurocognitive enhancing effects of stimulants, specifically [[modafinil]], amphetamine and methylphenidate have been documented in healthy adolescents, and is a commonly cited reason among illicit drug users for use, particularly among college students in the context of studying.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bagot|first1=Kara Simone|last2=Kaminer|first2=Yifrah|title=Efficacy of stimulants for cognitive enhancement in non-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder youth: a systematic review|journal=Addiction |date=1 April 2014|volume=109|issue=4|pages=547–557|pmid=24749160|issn=1360-0443}}</ref>

 
In some cases psychiatric phenomenon may emerge such as [[stimulant psychosis]], [[paranoia]], and [[suicidal ideation]].

Stimulants can have a wide variety of mechanisms.  Many stimulants exert their effects through manipulations of [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmission]].  Monoamines are a class of neurotransmitter relevant in reward, motivation, temperature regulation and pain sensation that include [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]].  Stimulants usually block the reuptake or stimulate the efflux of dopamine and norepinephrine resulting in increased activity of their circuits.  Some stimulants, notably those with [[empathogen]]ic and [[hallucinogen]]ic effects alter serotonergic neurotransmission.  Interference with vesicular storage, activating [[TAAR1]], and reversing the flow of monoamine transporters may play a mechanism in the activity of these drugs.  Adrenergic stimulants, such as ephedrine, may act by directly binding and activating the receptors that norepinephrine and epinephrine normally bind to([[adrenergic receptor]]s), producing sympathomimetic effects.  Some drugs, such as [[MDMA]] and derivatives may decrease regulatory capability by antagonizing regulatory pre-synaptic auto receptors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Docherty|first1=J R|title=Pharmacology of stimulants prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=7 January 2017|volume=154|issue=3|pages=606–622|doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.124|pmc=2439527|issn=0007-1188}}</ref>  Caffeine is a notable exception, as it exerts its effects by antagonizing [[adenosine receptor]]s instead of acting directly on monoamines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Caffeine for the Sustainment of Mental Task Performance: Formulations for Military Operations.|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|location=Washington (DC):|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/|language=en}}</ref>

{{Main article|Methylphenidate}}Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug that is often used in the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy and occasionally to treat obesity in combination with diet restraints and exercise. Its effects at therapeutic doses include increased focus, increased alertness, decreased appetite, decreased need for sleep and decreased impulsivity. Methylphenidate is not usually used recreationally, but when it is used, its effects are very similar to those of amphetamines.

 
Methylphenidate acts a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, by blocking the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) and the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT). Methylphenidate has a higher affinity for the dopamine transporter than for the norepinephrine transporter, and so its effects are mainly due to elevated dopamine levels caused by the inhibited reuptake  of dopamine, however increased norepinephrine levels also contribute to various of the effects caused by the drug.

 
[[Nicotine]] is the active chemical constituent in [[tobacco]], which is available in many forms, including [[cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, [[chewing tobacco]], and [[smoking cessation]] aids such as [[nicotine patch]]es, [[nicotine gum]], and [[electronic cigarette]]s. Nicotine is used widely throughout the world for its stimulating and relaxing effects.  Nicotine exerts its effects through the agonism of [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]], resulting in multiple downstream effects such as increase in activity of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain [[reward system]], as well as the decreased expression of [[monoamine oxidase]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Benowitz|first1=Neal L.|title=Pharmacology of Nicotine: Addiction, Smoking-Induced Disease, and Therapeutics|journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology|date=1 January 2009|volume=49|pages=57–71|doi=10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.48.113006.094742|pmc=2946180|issn=0362-1642}}</ref>  Nicotine is addictive and dependence forming.
