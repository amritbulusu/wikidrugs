'''Tedisamil''' (3,7-dicyclopropylmethyl-9,9-tetramethylene-3,7-diazabicyclo-3,3,1-nonane) is an experimental class III [[antiarrhythmic]] agent currently being investigated for the treatment of [[atrial fibrillation]]. Tedisamil blocks multiple types of potassium channels in the heart resulting in slowed heart rate. While the effects of tedisamil have been demonstrated in both atrial and ventricular muscle, repolarization is prolonged more efficiently in the atria.<ref name=Hohnloser>{{cite journal|last=Hohnloser|first=S.H.|title=Safety and Efficacy of Intravenously Administered Tedisamil for Rapid Conversion of Recent-Onset Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter|journal=Am J Cardiol|year=2004|volume=44|pages=99–104|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2004.03.047|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Tedisamil is administered intravenously and has a [[half-life]] of approximately 8 –13 hours in circulation.<ref name=Hohnloser /> Tedisamil is being developed as an alternative to other antiarrhythmics as incidence of additional arrhythmic events is lower compared to other class III agents.<ref name=Hohnloser /> Tedisamil also has significant anti-ischemic properties and was initially investigated as a potential treatment for angina until its antiarrhythmic effects were discovered.<ref name=Fox>{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=K.M.|title=Antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of tedisamil, a potassium channel blocker|journal=Heart|year=2000|volume=83|pages=167–171|doi=10.1136/heart.83.2.167 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>
