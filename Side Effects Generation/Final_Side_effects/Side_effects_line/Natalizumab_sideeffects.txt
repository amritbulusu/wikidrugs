Natalizumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in people with multiple sclerosis. The studies enrolled individuals with MS who experienced at least one clinical relapse during the prior year and had a Kurtzke [[Expanded Disability Status Scale|EDSS]] score between 0 and 5.  In these trials natalizumab was shown to reduce relapses in individuals with MS by 68% vs. [[placebo]], a margin far greater than had been seen for other approved MS therapies.<ref name = Polman>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Polman CH, O'Connor PW, Havrdova E, etal |title=A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of natalizumab for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis |journal=[[N.
