Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), also known as [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]], is an endogenous peptide hormone which is released in response to various triggers such as [[chronic stress]]. This then triggers the release of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|corticotropin]] (ACTH), another hormone which is involved in the physiological response to stress. Chronic release of CRF and ACTH is believed to be directly or indirectly involved in many of the harmful physiological effects of chronic stress, such as excessive [[glucocorticoid]] release, [[diabetes mellitus]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]], [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and development of [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and consequent cardiovascular problems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1196/annals.1367.021 |pmid=17148743 |title=Potential Uses of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1083 |pages=239â€“51 |year=2006 |last1=Zoumakis |first1=E |last2=Rice |first2=K.
