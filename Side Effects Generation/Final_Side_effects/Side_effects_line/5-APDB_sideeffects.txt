In animal studies, 5-APDB's effects generalize most closely to non-[[stimulant]] MDMA analogues such as [[MBDB]] and [[5-Methyl-6-methoxy-2-aminoindane|MMAI]], while producing no substitution for [[LSD]] or [[amphetamine]].<ref name="pmid8246240"/> ''[[In vitro]]'' studies show that 5-APDB acts as a highly [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA), with [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 130 nM, 7,089 nM, and 3,238 nM for [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]], respectively.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> In contrast, 6-APDB is more balanced on the three [[monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s and acts more similarly to MDA and MDMA.<ref name="pmid8246240"/>
