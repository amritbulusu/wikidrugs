'''Tonazocine''' ('''WIN-42,156''') is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] of the [[benzomorphan]] family which made it to [[clinical trial#Phase II|phase II]] [[clinical trial]]s for the treatment of postoperative pain,<ref name="Chemistry1990">{{cite book | author = American Chemical Society.

Tonazocine is a [[partial agonist]] at both the [[mu-opioid receptor|mu-opioid]] and [[delta-opioid receptor]]s, but acting more like an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] at the former and more like an [[receptor agonist|agonist]] at the latter.<ref name="pmid2860595">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ward SJ, Pierson AK, Michne WF | title = Pharmacological profiles of tonazocine (Win 42156) and zenazocine (Win 42964) | journal = Neuropeptides | volume = 5 | issue = 4-6 | pages = 375–8 |date=February 1985 | pmid = 2860595 | doi = 10.1016/0143-4179(85)90032-0| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0143-4179(85)90032-0}}</ref><ref name="pmid10822062">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hudzik TJ, Howell A, Payza K, Cross AJ | title = Antiparkinson potential of delta-opioid receptor agonists | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 396 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 101–7 |date=May 2000 | pmid = 10822062 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(00)00209-0| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014299900002090}}</ref> It lacks most of the [[side effect]]s of other opioids such as [[adverse effect]]s on the [[cardiovascular system]] and [[respiratory depression]], but it can cause [[sedation]] (although to a lesser degree of typical opioids), and in some patients it may induce [[hallucination]]s (probably via binding to and activating the [[κ-opioid receptor]]).<ref name="Aronson2009">{{cite book |first= Jeffrey K. |last=Aronson |authorlink=Jeffrey Aronson |title= Meyler's Side Effects of Analgesics and Anti-inflammatory Drugs | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2WxotnWiiWkC&pg=PA154 | accessdate = 30 November 2011 | date = 30 November 2009 | publisher = Elsevier | isbn = 978-0-444-53273-2 | page = 154}}</ref>
