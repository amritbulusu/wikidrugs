'''Pirenzepine''' ('''Gastrozepin'''), an [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|M<sub>1</sub>]] selective antagonist, is used in the treatment of [[peptic ulcers]], as it reduces [[gastric acid]] secretion and reduces [[muscle spasm]]. It is in a class of drugs known as [[muscarinic receptor antagonists]] - [[acetylcholine]] being the neurotransmitter of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] which initiates the rest-and-digest state (as opposed to fight-or-flight), resulting in an increase in gastric motility and digestion; whereas pirenzepine would inhibit these actions and cause decreased gastric motility leading to delayed gastric emptying and constipation.<ref name="Stolerman2010">{{cite book|last=Stolerman|first=Ian P.|title=Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoyYobgX0uwC&pg=PA811|accessdate=26 June 2013|date=2 August 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-68698-9|page=811}}</ref> It has no effects on the brain and spinal cord as it cannot diffuse through the [[bloodâ€“brain barrier]].
