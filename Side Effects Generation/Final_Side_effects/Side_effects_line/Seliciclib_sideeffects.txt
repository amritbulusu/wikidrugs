Seliciclib has been found to produce [[apoptosis]] in treated cancerous cells of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers.  Seliciclib has previously undergone [[Clinical trial#Phase II|Phase IIa clinical trials]], in 240 NSCLC patients as a combined dose with existing first- and second-line treatments.<ref name="PhaseIIbNSCLC"/><ref name="ASCOData">{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_May_15/ai_n13718674|title=Cyclacel Reports Interim Seliciclib Phase IIa Data at 2005 ASCO|publisher=Business Wire|date=May 15, 2005}}</ref>  In the current ''APPRAISE'' trial, the research drug is undergoing Phase IIb clinical trial as a monotherapy for NSCLC in third-line patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com//aspxcontent/newsstory.aspx?selected=CYCC&symbol=CYCC&textpath=20060814%5CACQBIZ200608141711BIZWIRE%5FUSPR%5F%5F%5F%5F%5FBW6007%2Ehtm&cdtime=08%2F14%2F2006+5%3A11PM|title=Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals Reports Second Quarter 2006 Financial Results|publisher=Business Wire|date=August 14, 2006}}</ref> The [[adverse effect|side-effects]] reported in Phase I trials of seliciclib for NSCLC were "[[nausea]], vomiting, transient elevations in serum creatinine and liver function parameters and transient [[hypokalemia]]".<ref name="ASCOData"/>

 
Seliciclib has been shown ''in vitro'' to induce [[apoptosis]] in [[neutrophil granulocytes]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rossi AG, Sawatzky DA, Walker A, Ward C, Sheldrake TA, Riley NA, Caldicott A, Martinez-Losa M, Walker TR, Duffin R, Gray M, Crescenzi E, Martin MC, Brady HJ, Savill JS, Dransfield I, Haslett C | title=Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors enhance the resolution of inflammation by promoting inflammatory cell apoptosis | journal=[[Nature Medicine]] | volume=12 | issue=9 | year=2006| pages=1056â€“1064 | pmid=16951685 | doi=10.1038/nm1468}}</ref> If this mechanism turns out to be safe, reliable and efficient ''in vivo'', the drug could improve treatment of chronic inflammation diseases such as [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[arthritis]]. These are usually treated with [[glucocorticoid]]s which often have serious side effects.
