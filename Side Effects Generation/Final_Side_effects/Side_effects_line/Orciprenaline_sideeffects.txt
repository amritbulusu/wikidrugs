'''Orciprenaline''', also known as '''metaproterenol''', is a [[bronchodilator]] used in the treatment of [[asthma]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = DrugBank 3.0: a comprehensive resource for omics research on drugs |vauthors=Knox C, Law V, Jewison T, Liu P, Ly S, Frolkis A, Pon A, Banco K, Mak C, Neveu V, Djoumbou Y, Eisner R, Guo AC, Wishart DS |journal = Nucleic Acids Res. |year = 2011 |volume = 39 |issue = Database issue |pages = D1035-41 | pmid =21059682 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1126 |pmc=3013709}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title = DrugBank: a knowledgebase for drugs, drug actions and drug targets |vauthors=Wishart DS, Knox C, Guo AC, Cheng D, Shrivastava S, Tzur D, Gautam B, Hassanali M |journal = Nucleic Acids Res |year = 2008 |volume = 36 |issue = Database issue |pages = D901-6 |pmid = 18048412 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm958 |pmc=2238889}}</ref> Orciprenaline is a moderately selective [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor agonist]] that stimulates receptors of the smooth muscle in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscle, with minimal or no effect on α adrenergic receptors. The pharmacologic effects of β adrenergic [[agonist]] drugs, such as orciprenaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through β adrenergic receptors of intracellular [[adenylyl cyclase]], the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]. Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from many cells, especially from mast cells.
