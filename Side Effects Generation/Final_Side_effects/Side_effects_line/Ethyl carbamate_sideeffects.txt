Ethyl carbamate has been used as an [[antineoplastic]] agent and for other medicinal purposes, but this application ended after it was discovered to be [[carcinogenic]] in 1943. However, Japanese usage in medical injections continued and from 1950 to 1975 an estimated 100 million 2 ml ampules of 7 to 15% solutions of ethyl carbamate were injected into patients as a co-solvent in water for dissolving water-insoluble analgesics used for post-operation pain. These doses were estimated to be at levels that are carcinogenic in mice.<ref>Nomura Cancer Research, volume 35, pages 2895–2899, October 1975.</ref> This practice was stopped in 1975. "This regrettable medical situation appears to have involved the largest number (millions) of humans exposed to the largest doses of a pure carcinogen that is on record".<ref>''Japanese Journal of Cancer Research'', 82, 1323–1324, December 1991.</ref> The author, U.S. cancer researcher James A. Miller, called for studies to determine the effects on Japanese cancer rates to be performed but apparently none were ever done.

 
Ethyl carbamate is frequently used as an [[anaesthetic]] in [[animal experimentation|animal experiments]], with more than 100 animal studies using ethyl carbamate published each year.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hara | first1 = K. | last2 = Harris | first2 = R.A. | year = 2002 | title = The anesthetic mechanism of urethane: the effects on neurotransmitter-gated ion channels | url = | journal = Anesthesia & Analgesia | volume = 94 | issue = 2| pages = 313–8 | doi=10.1213/00000539-200202000-00015}}</ref> One advantage of using ethyl carbamate is that it has a very long duration of action, with some adult rats remaining anaesthetised 24 hours after administration of the drug.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Field | first1 = K.J. | last2 = White | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Lang | first3 = C.M. | year = 1993 | title = Anaesthetic effects of chloral hydrate, pentobarbitone and urethane in adult male rats | url = | journal = Laboratory Animals | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 258–69 | doi=10.1258/002367793780745471}}</ref> It also does not depress neuronal activity in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] to the same extent as [[isoflurane]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rojas | first1 = M.J. | last2 = Navas | first2 = J.A. | last3 = Rector | first3 = D.M. | year = 2006 | title = Evoked response potential markers for anesthetic and behavioral states | url = | journal = American Journal of Physiology.
