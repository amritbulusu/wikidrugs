== Adverse Effects ==

 
Amcinonide exhibits side effects common among other corticosteroids.  While these reactions are uncommon for most delivery vehicles, the use of occlusive dressings increases the likelihood of such effects.<ref name="Four" />  These include burning, itching, skin dryness and irritation, acne/ pimples, skin atrophy, blistering, and/ or skin discoloration.<ref name="Four" /><ref name="Five">Drugs.com: [http://www.drugs.com/sfx/amcinonide-topical-side-effects.html Amcinonide Topical]</ref> While most side effects are mild, a medical professional should be contacted if severe rash, acne, skin deterioration, excessive hair growth, or abnormal weight gain occur.  Following package insert instructions for a single topical dose, as detailed on the package insert, should not lead to any toxicities.<ref name="Five" />

 
Amcinonide is produced from the reaction of 16α,17α-Cyciopentylidenedioxy-9α-fluoro-11β,21-dihydroxy-1,4pregnadiene-3,20-dione and [[acetic anhydride]] in which 11.1g and 5.5mL, respectively, of each reactant are consumed to produce 7.0g of pure product.<ref name="Eight" />  Only 4.7% of patients in clinical trials reported experiencing side effects as a result of continued use of Amcinonide.  Specifically, in one acceptability study conducted on a weekly basis, one-fifth of patients using both placebo and Cyclocort 0.1% lotion reported various discomforts at multiple interviews.<ref>DrugBank.ca:[http://www.drugbank.ca/system/fda_labels/DB00288.pdf?1265922798 Cyclocort (Amcinonide)]</ref>  The outcomes of relevant trials are included below.

 
One of the initial clinical studies into Amcinonide, conducted by Woodford & Barry, 1979, compared topical applications Amcinonide to [[Triamcinolone Acetonide]].  Specifically, 0.1% strength preparations of each compound were tested against 0.025% Synalar Gel and 0.1% Betnovate Cream using a vasoconstrictor assay to determine [[bioavailability]] and anti-inflammatory effects.  All formulations had similar bioavailability profiles with the peak of the curve coming approximately 12 hours after topical administration and covering with an occlusive dressing.  Concluding, the study found Amcinonide cream to be the most effective with the highest bio-activity and [[area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)]].<ref>{{Cite journal
