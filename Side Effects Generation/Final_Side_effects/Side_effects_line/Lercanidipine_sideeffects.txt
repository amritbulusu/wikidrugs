The drug acts more slowly than older dihydropyridines. It probably has fewer adverse effects, but a comparatively high potential for drug interactions. Lercanidipine was first marketed in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordati.com/en/about_us/history/|title=About Us|publisher=Recordati|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>

 
== Adverse effects ==

 
Lercanidipine is generally well tolerated; no single adverse effect has been observed in more than 1% of patients treated with this drug. Typical side effects are similar to those of other drugs of this class and include headache, dizziness, [[tachycardia]] (fast heartbeat), [[palpitations]], [[flush (physiology)|flush]], and [[oedema]]. [[Hypersensitivity]] reactions occur in less than one patient in 10,000.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

 
Oedemas are significantly less common under lercanidipine when compared to first-generation dihydropyridines such as [[nifedipine]]. For other side effects, data are inconclusive: A study comparing lercanidipine to first-generation drugs found no difference in the frequency of headache and flush,<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19808126|year=2009|author1=Makarounas-Kirchmann|first1=K|title=Results of a meta-analysis comparing the tolerability of lercanidipine and other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1652–63|last2=Glover-Koudounas|first2=S|last3=Ferrari|first3=P|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.08.010}}</ref> but switching from [[amlodipine]], [[felodipine]] or [[nitrendipine]] (all at least second generation) to lercanidipine significantly decreased side effects in another study.<ref name="Dinnendahl" />
