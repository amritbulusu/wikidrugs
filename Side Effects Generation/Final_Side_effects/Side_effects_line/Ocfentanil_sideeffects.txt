'''Ocfentanil''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (also called '''A-3217''') is a potent synthetic [[opioid]] structurally related to [[fentanyl]]<ref>{{cite journal|first1=C.

Side effects of [[fentanyl]] analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]], which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Jane|last1=Mounteney|first2=Isabelle|last2=Giraudon|first3=Gleb|last3=Denissov|first4=Paul|last4=Griffiths|title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?
