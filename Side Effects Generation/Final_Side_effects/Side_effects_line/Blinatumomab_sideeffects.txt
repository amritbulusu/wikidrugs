Peter Bach, director of the [[Center for Health Policy and Outcomes]] at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], has calculated that according to "value-based pricing," assuming that the value of a year of life is $121,000 with a 15% "toxicity discount,"  the market price of blinaumomab should be $12,612 a month, compared to the market price of $64,260 a month. A representative of Amgen said, “The price of Blincyto reflects the significant clinical, economic and humanistic value of the product to patients and the health-care system. The price also reflects the complexity of developing, manufacturing and reliably supplying innovative biologic medicines.”<ref name=Wall2015>{{cite news|author1=Peter Loftus|title=How Much Should Cancer Drugs Cost?
