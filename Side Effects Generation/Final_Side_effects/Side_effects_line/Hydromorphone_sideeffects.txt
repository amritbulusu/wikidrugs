'''Hydromorphone''', also known as '''dihydromorphinone''', and sold under the brand name '''Dilaudid''', among others, is a centrally acting [[analgesic|pain medication]] of the [[opioid]] class.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.drugs.com/pro/hydromorphone.html |title = Hydromorphone – FDA prescribing information, side effects and uses |author =  |date =  |website = drugs.com |accessdate = 2 September 2017 }}</ref> It is made from [[morphine]]. Comparatively, hydromorphone is to morphine as [[hydrocodone]] is to [[codeine]] – it is a hydrogenated ketone thereof. In medical terms, it is an opioid analgesic, and in legal terms, a [[narcotic]]. Hydromorphone is commonly used in the hospital setting, mostly intravenously (IV) because its bioavailability is very low orally, rectally, and intranasally. [[Sublingual administration]] (under the tongue) is usually superior to swallowing for bioavailability and effects; however, hydromorphone is bitter and [[hydrophilic]] like most opiates, not [[lipophilic]], so it is absorbed poorly and slowly through mouth membranes.

 
== Side effects ==

 
Adverse effects of hydromorphone are similar to those of other potent opioid analgesics, such as [[morphine]] and [[heroin]]. The major hazards of hydromorphone include dose-related [[respiratory depression]], urinary retention, bronchospasm and sometimes circulatory depression.<ref name="rxlist.com">[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/hydromorphone_ad.htm Hydromorphone Monograph] (Side Effects & Drug Interactions)</ref> More common [[adverse effect|side effects]] include [[lightheadedness]], [[dizziness]], [[sedation]], [[itch]]ing, [[constipation]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], [[perspiration]], and [[hallucination]]s.<ref name="rxlist.com" /> These symptoms are common in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.

 
Simultaneous use of hydromorphone with other opioids, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, sedatives, and general anesthetics can cause a significant increase in respiratory depression, progressing to coma or death. Taking [[benzodiazepine]]s (such as [[diazepam]]) in conjunction with hydromorphone may increase side effects such as dizziness and difficulty concentrating.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/dilaudid-with-valium-1294-768-862-441.html |title = Drug interactions between Dilaudid and Valium |accessdate = 19 November 2014 }}</ref> If simultaneous use of these drugs is required, dose adjustment can be done.<ref name="app.purduepharma.com">{{Cite web |title = Dilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride) Oral LiquidDilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride) Tablets |url = http://app.purduepharma.com/xmlpublishing/pi.aspx?id=dt |website = app.purduepharma.com |accessdate = 5 November 2015 }}</ref>

 
Massive overdoses are rarely observed in opioid-tolerant individuals, but when they occur, they may lead to circulatory system collapse. Symptoms of overdose include respiratory depression, drowsiness leading to coma and sometimes to death, drooping of skeletal muscles, low heart rate and decreasing blood pressure. At the hospital, individuals with hydromorphone overdose are provided supportive care such as assisted ventilation to provide oxygen, gut decontamination using activated charcoal through a nasogastric tube. Opioid antagonist such as naloxone can also be administered concurrent with oxygen supplementation. Naloxone works by reversing the effects of hydromorphone. It is only administered in the presence of significant respiratory depression and circulatory depression.<ref name="app.purduepharma.com" />

 
The effects of overdose can be exacerbated by [[dose dumping]] if the medication is taken with [[Ethanol|alcohol]].<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20050714/palladone-pain-drug-pulled-off-market Palladone Pain Drug Pulled Off the Market].</ref>

CNS depressants may enhance the depressant effects of hydromorphone, such as other opioids, [[anesthetic]]s, [[sedative]]s, [[hypnotic]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, benzodiazepines, [[phenothiazine]]s, [[chloral hydrate]], [[dimenhydrinate]], and [[glutethimide]].  The depressant effect of hydromorphone may also be enhanced by [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAO inhibitors) (including [[procarbazine]]), first-generation [[antihistamine]]s ([[brompheniramine]], [[promethazine]], [[diphenhydramine]], [[chlorphenamine]]), [[beta blocker]]s, and [[alcohol]].

Hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic [[Opioid receptor#The μ-opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] [[agonist]]. As a hydrogenated ketone of morphine, it shares the pharmacologic properties typical of [[opioid analgesic]]s. Hydromorphone and related opioids produce their major effects on the [[central nervous system]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]]. These include [[analgesia]], drowsiness, mental clouding, changes in mood, [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] or [[dysphoria]], respiratory depression, cough suppression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased [[biliary tract|biliary pressure]], and increased pinpoint constriction of the pupils.<ref name=":3" />

 
While other opioids in its class such as [[codeine]] or oxycodone are metabolized via CYP450 enzymes, hydromorphone is not.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Hydromorphone: Evolving to Meet the Challenges of Today’s Health Care Environment |url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0149291813010229 |journal = Clinical Therapeutics |pages = 2007–2027 |volume = 35 |issue = 12 |doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.09.027 |first = Thomas B. |last = Gregory }}</ref> Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized in the liver to hydromorphone-3-glucoronide, which has no analgesic effects.  As similarly seen with the morphine metabolite, morphine-3-glucoronide, a build-up in levels of hydromorphone-3-glucoronide can produce excitatory neurotoxic effects such as restlessness, myoclonus and hyperalgesia. Patients with compromised kidney function and older patients are at higher risk for metabolite accumulation.<ref>http://www.painweek.org/../292-50.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/pediatrics/education/pharm-news/2006-2010/200807.pdf |title = Use of Hydromorphone in Children and Adolescents |date = July 2008 |accessdate = 5 November 2015 |website =  |publisher = University of Virginia Children's Hospital |last = Buck |first = Marcia }}</ref>

The brand name ''Dilaudid'' is more widely known than the generic term hydromorphone and, because of this, ''Dilaudid'' is often used generically to mean any form of hydromorphone.

 
Like other opiates, hydromorphone can be used recreationally. Its reinforcing effects are mediated via its strong affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, inducing euphoria, sedation, [[anxiolytic|reduced anxiety]], respiratory depression, and other prototypical morphinian effects. Such effects make it particularly susceptible to abuse, although many patients using it for analgesia are able to use it for extended periods of time without developing drug-seeking behavior. In abusers, there can be a strong psychological dependence, thus creating an [[addiction]] with repeated use. Physical dependence causes [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], while psychological dependence can create strong compulsions to use the drug, which can persist for days or weeks after the physical dependence is broken, and has been known to induce anxiety, insomnia, depression, and a range of other persistent mental illnesses. For this reason, psychotherapy is often included in detox programs, sometimes augmented with pharmacological therapies. Hydromorphone is more expensive on the illicit market than heroin,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} despite producing similar effects, thus causing the abuse rates of hydromorphone to be lower than heroin and similar opioids in many areas.
