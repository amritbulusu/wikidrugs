Daptomycin, originally designated as LY 146032, was discovered by researchers at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in the late 1980s. LY 146032 showed promise in phase I/II [[clinical trial]]s for treatment of infection caused by Gram-positive organisms. Lilly ceased development because high-dose therapy was associated with adverse effects on skeletal muscle, including [[myalgia]] and potential [[myositis]].
