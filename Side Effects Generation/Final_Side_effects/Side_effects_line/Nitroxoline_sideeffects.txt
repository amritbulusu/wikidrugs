The chelating activities of nitroxoline have also been used in an anticancer setting.  Nitroxoline has been shown to be more [[cytotoxic]] to [[HL60]], DHL-4, Panc-1, and A2780 cells lines than [[clioquinol]] and other [[8-hydroxyquinoline]] derivatives.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiang H, Taggart JE, Zhang X, Benbrook DM, Lind SE, Ding W |title=Nitroxoline (8-hydroxy-5-nitroquinoline) is more a potent anti-cancer agent than clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinoline) |journal=Cancer Lett |volume=312 |pages=11â€“17 |year=2011 |pmc=3395224 |doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.032 |pmid=21899946 |issue=1}}</ref>   It also demonstrated an increase in [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production over controls, especially when Cu<sup>2+</sup> was added.  The ROS levels reached over 350% of the controls with addition of CuCl<sub>2</sub>.  Interestingly, the cytotoxicity production was markedly decreased with addition of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, indicating, based on this model, that nitroxoline is not a zinc chelator.  Because the zinc chelating action of clioquinol has been associated with [[subacute myelo-optic neuropathy]], the use of nitroxoline as a cytotoxic drug in the treatment of cancers should not exhibit neurotoxic effects in humans, and ''in vivo'' trials on tumour xenografts in mice have not yielded any negative neurodegenerative effects.
