Glufosfamide, being a conjugate of [[glucose]] and active alkylating moiety of [[ifosfamide]], has the better cell permeability than the parent compound — ifosfamide — or its metabolites. Glufosfamide utilizes the normal cell glucose transport mechanism (a sodium-dependent glucose/sodium co-transporter) for its own transport into the cell. And the glucose uptake mechanism is grossly overexpressed and upregulated in certain cancer cell lines, especially [[pancreatic cancer]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]], and [[glioblastoma multiforme]]. This, theoretically, should render them more sensitive to the alkylating effects of glufosfamide while relatively sparing (doing relatively little collateral damage) to the normal cells in which the glucose uptake mechanism is not so upregulated.<ref>Glufosfamide: beta-D-Glc -IPM, D 19575.Drugs R D. 2005, 6 (1) :49-52, {{PMID|15801867}}.</ref>
