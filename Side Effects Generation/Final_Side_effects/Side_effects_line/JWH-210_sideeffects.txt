'''JWH-210''' is an [[analgesic]] chemical from the [[naphthoylindole]] family, which acts as a potent [[cannabinoid]] agonist at both the [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cannabinoid receptor 2 (macrophage)|CB<sub>2</sub>]] receptors, with K<sub>i</sub> values of 0.46nM at CB<sub>1</sub> and 0.69nM at CB<sub>2</sub>. It is one of the most potent 4-substituted naphthoyl derivatives in the naphthoylindole series, having a higher [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|binding affinity]] (i.e. lower K<sub>i</sub>) at CB<sub>1</sub> than both its 4-methyl and 4-''n''-propyl [[homolog (chemistry)|homologue]]s [[JWH-122]] (CB<sub>1</sub> K<sub>i</sub> 0.69nM) and '''JWH-182''' (CB<sub>1</sub> K<sub>i</sub> 0.65nM) respectively, and than the 4-methoxy compound [[JWH-081]] (CB<sub>1</sub> K<sub>i</sub> 1.2nM).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.bmc.2004.09.050 |pmid= 15582455 |year= 2005 |last= Huffman |first= J.|title= Structure-activity relationships for 1-alkyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indoles at the cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors: steric and electronic effects of naphthoyl substituents.
