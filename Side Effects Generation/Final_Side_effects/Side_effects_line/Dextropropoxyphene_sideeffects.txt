'''Dextropropoxyphene'''<ref>US Patent 2728779 - Esters of Substituted Aminobutanes</ref> is an [[analgesic]] in the [[opioid]] category, patented in 1955<ref>Thieme Chemistry (Hrsg.): RÖMPP Online – Version 3.32. Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart, 30. April 2013.</ref> and manufactured by [[Eli Lilly and Company]].  It is an [[optical isomer]] of [[levopropoxyphene]]. It is intended to treat mild pain and also has [[antitussive]] (cough suppressant) and [[local anaesthetic]] effects. The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/736718?src=mp&spon=25 Physicians Say Good Riddance to 'Worst Drug in History'] By Allison Gandey. February 2, 2011</ref> Its onset of analgesia (pain relief) is said to be 20–30 minutes and peak effects are seen about 1.5–2 hours after oral administration.<ref name = cancer/>

 
In pure form, dextropropoxyphene is commonly used to ease the [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms in people addicted to opioids. Being very weak in comparison to commonly abused opioids, dextropropoxyphene can only act as a "partial" substitute. It does not have much effect on mental cravings; however, it can be effective in alleviating physical withdrawal effects, such as muscle cramps.

 
===Side effects===

 
An overdose of dextropropoxyphene may lead to various systemic effects. Excessive opioid receptor stimulation is responsible for the [[CNS depression]], [[respiratory depression]], [[aspiration pneumonia]], [[miosis]], and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]- or [[thought]]-altering effects. In the presence of amphetamine, propoxyphene overdose will increase CNS stimulation and may cause fatal convulsive seizures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/017078s048lbl.pdf|title=Dexedrine® (dextroamphetamine sulfate) Spansule® sustained release capsules [Label]|last=|first=|date=|website=US Food and Drug Administration|publisher=Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC|publication-date=February 2015|access-date=November 11, 2016|quote=In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.}}</ref>

 
In addition, both propoxyphene and its metabolite [[norpropoxyphene]] have local [[anesthetic]] effects at concentrations about 10 times those necessary for opioid effects. Norpropoxyphene is a more potent local anesthetic than propoxyphene, and they are both more potent than [[lidocaine]].<ref name=Nickander1>Nickander ''et al.'', 1984</ref> Local anesthetic activity appears to be responsible for the [[arrhythmias]] and cardiovascular depression seen in propoxyphene poisoning.<ref name=Strom1/>

 
These direct cardiac effects include decreased [[heart rate]] (i.e. cardiovascular depression), decreased [[contractility]], and decreased [[electrical conductivity]] (i.e., increased PR, AH, HV, and QRS intervals). These effects appear to be due to their local anesthetic activity and are not reversed by [[naloxone]].<ref name=Nickander1/><ref name=Strom1>Strom ''et al.'', 1985b</ref><ref name=Bredgaard1>Bredgaard, Sorensen ''et al.'', 1984</ref> Widening of the QRS complex appears to be a result of a quinidine-like effect of propoxyphene, and [[sodium bicarbonate]] therapy appears to have a positive direct effect on the QRS dysrhythmia.<ref name=Stork1>Stork ''et al.'', 1995</ref>

 
[[Seizure]]s may result from either opioid or local anesthetic effects.<ref name=Nickander1/> [[Pulmonary edema]] may result from direct [[pulmonary toxicity]], [[neurogenic]]/[[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxic]] effects, or cardiovascular depression.<ref name=Strom1/>

 
The decision to withdraw coproxamol has met with some controversy; it has been brought up in the House of Commons on two occasions, 13 July 2005<ref>[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2005-07-13a.936.0 Co-Proxamol: 13 Jul 2005: House of Commons debates (TheyWorkForYou.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and on 17 January 2007.<ref>[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2007-01-17b.340.0 Co-proxamol: 17 Jan 2007: Westminster Hall debates (TheyWorkForYou.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Patients have found alternatives to co-proxamol either too strong, too weak, or with intolerable side effects.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} During the House of Commons debates, it is quoted that originally some 1,700,000 patients in the UK were prescribed co-proxamol. Following the phased withdrawal, this has eventually been reduced to 70,000. However, it appears this is the residual pool of patients who cannot find alternate analgesia to co-proxamol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

 
Because of potential for side effects, this drug is on the list for High Risk Medications in the elderly.<ref>[http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf NCQA's HEDIS Measure: Use of High Risk Medications in the Elderly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201113909/http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |date=February 1, 2010 }}</ref>
