'''Phenazocine''' (brand names '''Prinadol''', '''Narphen''') is an [[opioid analgesic]] [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]], which is related to [[pentazocine]] and has a similar profile of effects.

 
Effects of phenazocine include analgesia and [[euphoria]], also may include [[dysphoria]] and [[hallucinations]] at high doses, most likely due to action at [[Kappa opioid receptor|κ-opioid]] and [[Sigma receptor|σ receptors]].<ref name="Harris">{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris LS, Pierson AK | title=Some Narcotic Antagonists in the Benzomorphan Series | journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |date=February 1964 | pages=141–8 | volume= 143| issue=  | pmid=14163985}}</ref>

 
Phenazocine appears to be a much stronger analgesic with fewer side effects than pentazocine, probably due to a more favorable [[mu opioid receptor|μ]]/κ binding ratio.
