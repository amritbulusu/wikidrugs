If cancer is suspected, a biopsy is offered expediently. During a biopsy a [[urology|urologist]] or [[radiology|radiologist]] obtains tissue samples from the prostate via the rectum. A biopsy gun inserts and removes special hollow-core needles (usually three to six on each side of the prostate) in less than a second. Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization.

Which option is best depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are age, general health, and a person's views about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because most treatments can have significant [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s, such as [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[urinary incontinence]], treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations.

Active surveillance involves monitoring the tumor for signs of growth or the appearance of symptoms. The monitoring process may involve serial PSA, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies. The goal of surveillance is to avoid [[overtreatment]] and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that would never cause any problems for the person. This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause [[anxiety]] for people who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have life-threatening cancer. For 50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies from other causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/041911/page2 |title=Active Surveillance May Be Preferred Option in Some Men with Prostate Cancer |publisher=Cancer.gov |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503081607/http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/041911/page2 |archivedate=2011-05-03 |df= }}</ref>

Hence, 5-LOX inhibitors have been targeted for their chemopreventive effects. Inhibition of 5-LOX activity is shown to block prostate cancer cell proliferation as well as carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis (119, 120).&nbsp;... Both 5-HETE and 12-HETE are also products of lipoxygenase and are involved in tumor progression (12). Exogenous 5-HETE can stimulate the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and act as a survival factor (137, 138). These results require relatively high concentrations (at a concentration of 10 μM).

Recent studies with 5-LOX siRNA [10] and specific blocker of 5-LOX [24] revealed the relation of this gene with the tumor cell proliferation.&nbsp;... Meclofenamate sodium (MS) is known for its anti-inflammatory activity, and apart from this, Boctor et al. [37] reported that it caused reduction in the formation of 5-HETE in human leucocytes when used. MS can thus be considered a dual inhibitor of 5-LOX and COX pathways of arachidonic acid cascade. Further investigation with this substance revealed that it could interfere with the LT receptors in the lung carcinoma [38]. In a recent study, a group of scientists have shown the effect of MS on prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [39], and their result suggests a profound reduction in the tumor growth and cancer metastasis.&nbsp;... While the commonly used inhibitors produced strong cytotoxicity, notably, zileuton, the only commercialized 5-LOX inhibitor, failed to induce an anti-proliferative or cytotoxic response in all other types of tumor cells where 5-LOX was in inactive state (e.g. HeLa cells); however, where 5-LOX was in active state, zileuton could effectively inhibit progression, as in case of prostate cancer.}}</ref> In particular, [[arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors]] produce massive, rapid programmed cell death in prostate cancer cells.<ref name="Primary source cited in 1st review" /><ref name="MEDRS review 1" /><ref name="MEDRS review 2" />
