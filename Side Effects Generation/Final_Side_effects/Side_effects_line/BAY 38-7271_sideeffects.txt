Originally synthesized by chemist Wayne E. Kenney, '''BAY 38-7271''' ('''KN 38-7271''') is a drug which is a [[cannabinoid receptor]] agonist developed by [[Bayer|Bayer AG]]. It has [[analgesic]] and [[neuroprotective]] effects and is used in scientific research, with proposed uses in the treatment of [[traumatic brain injury]].<ref>Mauler F, Horváth E, De Vry J, Jäger R, Schwarz T, Sandmann S, Weinz C, Heinig R, Böttcher M.
