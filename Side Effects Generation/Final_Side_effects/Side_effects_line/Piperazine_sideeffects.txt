Piperazine was first introduced as an [[anthelmintic]] in 1953{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}<!-- piperazine or piperazines? -->. A large number of piperazine compounds have anthelmintic action. Their mode of action is generally by [[paralysis|paralysing]] [[parasitism|parasites]], which allows the host body to easily remove or expel the invading organism. The neuromuscular effects are thought to be caused by blocking acetylcholine at the myoneural junction. This action is mediated by its [[agonist]] effects upon the inhibitory [[GABA receptor|GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptor]]. Its selectivity for [[helminths]] is because [[vertebrates]] only use [[GABA]] in the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] and the helminths' GABA receptor is a different isoform to the vertebrates' one.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors = Martin RJ|date=31 July 1997|title=Modes of action of anthelmintic drugs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002330580005X|journal=The Veterinary Journal|volume=154 | issue = 1 |doi=10.1016/S1090-0233(05)80005-X|pages=11–34}}</ref>

 
Piperazines are also used in the manufacture of plastics, resins, pesticides, brake fluid and other industrial materials.  Piperazines, especially [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]] and [[Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine|TFMPP]] were extremely common adulterants in the club and rave scene, often being passed off as [[MDMA]], although they do not share many similarities in their effects.
