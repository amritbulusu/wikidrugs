'''MDA-19''' is a drug that acts as a potent and selective [[agonist]] for the [[cannabinoid receptor]] [[Cannabinoid receptor 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]], with reasonable selectivity over the psychoactive CB<sub>1</sub> receptor, though with some variation between species. In animal studies it was effective for the treatment of [[neuropathic pain]], but failed to produce cannabis-like behavioural effects.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Diaz | first1 = Philippe | last2 = Xu | first2 = Jijun | year = 2008 | title = Design and Synthesis of a Novel Series of N-Alkyl Isatin Acylhydrazone Derivatives that Act as Selective Cannabinoid Receptor 2 Agonists for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain | journal = J.
