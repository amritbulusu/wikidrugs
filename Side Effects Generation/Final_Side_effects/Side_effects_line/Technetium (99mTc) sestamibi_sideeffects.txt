By the mid 1970s, scientists and clinicians alike began using [[thallium-201]]  as the radioisotope of choice for human studies.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DePuey|first1=E.

The isotope required exercise for an additional minute to enhance circulation of the isotope.  Using nuclear cameras of the day and given the limitations of Tl-201, the first "stress" image could not be taken until 1 hour after "stress".  In keeping with the concept of comparison images, the second "stress" image was taken 4 hours after "stress" and compared with the first.  The movement of Tl-201 reflected differences in tissue delivery (blood flow) and function (mitochondrial activity).  The relatively long half-life of Tl-201 (72 hours) forced doctors to use relatively small ({{convert|2|-|3|mCi|MBq|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}}) doses of Tl-201, albeit with relatively large dose exposure and tissue effects (20 mSv).  The poor quality images resulted in the search for isotopes which would produce better results.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Strauss|first1=H.
