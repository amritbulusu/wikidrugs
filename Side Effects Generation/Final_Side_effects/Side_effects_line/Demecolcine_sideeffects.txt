Demecolcine is a microtubule-depolymerizing drug like [[vinblastine]]. It acts by two distinct mechanisms. At very low concentration it binds to microtubule plus end to suppress microtubule dynamics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jordan |first1=Mary Ann |last2=Wilson |first2=Leslie |title=Microtubules as a target for anticancer drugs |journal=Nature Reviews.

Detached microtubules with unprotected minus end depolymerizes with time.
