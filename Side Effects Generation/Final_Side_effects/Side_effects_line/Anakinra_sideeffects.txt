* Preexisting active [[tuberculosis]] (disease may be worsened â€“ see side-effects).

 
* Pregnancy: animal studies showed no adverse effects. Human data is not available. The drug should be applied to pregnant women only if clearly indicated.

 
==Side-effects==

 
Methotrexate has been coadministered with anakinra in quite extended clinical studies. Neither specific drug interactions nor increased toxicity of anakinra and/or methotrexate have been noticed. In animal models (rats) studying the effects of both drugs when coadminstered, no effects on clearing of both drugs form plasma or on the respective toxicologic properties have been seen. Therefore, the concomitant use of both disease modifiers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis can be regarded as safe.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

 
The Nijmegen ME/CFS centre is starting a RCT to study the effects of Anakinra treatment in 46 female ME/CFS patients.
