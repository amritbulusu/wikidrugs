Since 2000, Flubendazole-treated grit has increasingly been laid out on a landscape-scale across many UK [[Red grouse|grouse]]-shooting moors by [[gamekeeper]]s in an attempt to reduce the impact on bird numbers from [[Trichostrongylus tenuis|strongyle worm]]. Evidence of high worm burden is required before a veterinarian can dispense and sell the product, known as 'medicated grit'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best practice use of medicated grit|url=http://www.gwct.org.uk/advisory/guides/medicated-grit-best-practice/|website=Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref> However, there has been increasing concern about contaminants entering the ground waters running off from moorlands, as well as from its use in farming environments and its presence in [[manure]]. Researchers are starting to gather research evidence in order to inform policy development on the presence of this and other veterinary medicines in the wider environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kay|first1=Dr. Paul|title=Analysis, occurrence and effects of flubendazole in moorland river catchments|url=http://www.nercdtp.leeds.ac.uk/projects/index.php?id=527|website=www.nercdtp.leeds.ac.uk|publisher=Leeds York NERC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP)|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kreuzig|first1=Robert|last2=Blümlein|first2=Katharina|last3=Höltge|first3=Sibylla|title=Fate of the Benzimidazole Antiparasitics Flubendazole and Fenbendazole in Manure and Manured Soils|journal=CLEAN - Soil Air Water|date=November 2007|volume=35|issue=5|pages=488-494|doi=10.1002/clen.200720023|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227792944_Fate_of_the_Benzimidazole_Antiparasitics_Flubendazole_and_Fenbendazole_in_Manure_and_Manured_Soils|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>
