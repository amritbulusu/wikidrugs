'''Dimethocaine''' ('''Larocaine''') is a [[local anesthetic]] with [[stimulant]] properties that some studies have shown to be half the potency of [[cocaine]].<ref name=Wilcox>{{cite journal|last1=Wilcox |first1=KM |last2=Kimmel |first2=HL |last3=Lindsey |first3=KP |last4=Votaw |first4=JR |last5=Goodman |first5=MM |last6=Howell |first6=LL |title=In vivo comparison of the reinforcing and dopamine transporter effects of local anesthetics in rhesus monkeys  and rabbits. |url=http://research.yerkes.emory.edu/Howell/Synapse58.pdf |journal=Synapse |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=220–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16206183 |doi=10.1002/syn.20199 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611201857/http://research.yerkes.emory.edu/Howell/Synapse58.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Woodward JJ, Compton DM, Balster RL, Martin BR |title=In vitro and in vivo effects of cocaine and selected local anesthetics on the dopamine transporter |journal=Eur.

When a product sold online in the UK in June 2010, advertised as dimethocaine was tested, it was found to in fact be a mixture of [[caffeine]] and [[lidocaine]],<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Brandt | first1 = S.

Other samples tested have however been shown to contain genuine dimethocaine, and one branded "bath salt" product containing primarily dimethocaine as the active ingredient, was noted to have been particularly subject to abuse by intravenous drug users in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.nacd.ie/publications/Head_Report2011_overview.pdf An overview of new psychoactive substances and the outlets supplying them] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125000000/http://www.nacd.ie/publications/Head_Report2011_overview.pdf |date=November 25, 2011 }}</ref>
