'''Dihexa''' (developmental code name '''PNB-0408'''), also known as '''''N''-hexanoic-Tyr-Ile-(6) aminohexanoic amide''', is an [[oligopeptide]] [[drug]] derived from [[angiotensin|angiotensin IV]] that binds with high [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] to [[hepatocyte growth factor]] (HGF) and potentiates its activity at its receptor, [[c-Met]]. The compound has been found to potently improve cognitive function in [[animal model]]s of [[Alzheimer's disease]]-like [[cognitive deficit|mental impairment]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/patents/US8598118 | title=Patent US 8598118 - Hepatocyte growth factor mimics as therapeutic agents | date=3 December 2013 | accessdate=11 October 2015 |author1=Joseph W.
