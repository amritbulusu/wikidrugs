'''Dezocine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) (brand name '''Dalgan''') is a marketed [[opioid]] [[analgesia|analgesic]] of the [[benzomorphan]] group.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Dezocine is a mixed [[agonist]]/[[antagonist]] of opioid receptors. It is related to other benzomorphans such as [[pentazocine]], with a similar profile of effects that include analgesia and [[euphoria]].<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Zacny, J. P. |author2=Lichtor, J.

Due to its partial agonist nature at the MOR, dezocine has significantly reduced side effects relative to opioid analgesics acting as [[full agonist]]s of the MOR such as [[morphine]].<ref name="LiuHuang2014" /> Moreover, dezocine is not a controlled substance and there are no reports of addiction related to its use, indicating that, unlike virtually all other clinically-employed MOR agonists (including weak partial agonists like [[buprenorphine]]) and for reasons that are not fully clear, it is apparently non-addictive.<ref name="LiuHuang2014" />

 
Dezocine is generally administered [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. It can also be administered in [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] doses, and is given singularly rather than continuously. Dezocine has been found to be an effective painkiller comparable to [[meperidine]] (pethidine),<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Camu, F. |author2=Gepts, E. | title = Analgesic Properties of Dezocine for Relief of Postoperative Pain | journal = Acta Anaesthesiologica Belgica | year = 1979 | volume = 30 | issue = Suppl | pages = 183–191 | pmid = 398127 }}</ref> and so is a more effective analgesic than pentazocine, but causes relatively more [[respiratory depression]] than pentazocine.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Wuest, H.

===Side effects===

 
Because decozine has mixed agonist/antagonist effects on mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors, it has a lowered [[dependence (behavioral medicine)|dependence]] potential than purely agonistic opiates. It can be prescribed, therefore, in small doses over an extended period of time without causing patients to develop and sustain an [[addiction]]. Its efficacy as an analgesic is dose-dependent; however, it displays a [[ceiling effect (pharmacology)|ceiling effect]] in induced respiratory depression at 0.3-0.4&nbsp;mg/kg.

 
Side effects at lower doses include mild gastrointestinal discomfort and dizziness. It is often administered in post-operative laproscopy patients as an alternative to fentanyl.
