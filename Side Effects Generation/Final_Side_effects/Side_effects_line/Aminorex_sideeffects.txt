Aminorex, in the 2-[[amine|amino]]-5-[[aryl]] [[oxazoline]] class, was developed by McNeil in 1962.<ref>US Patent 3161650 - 2-Amino-5-Aryloxazoline Products</ref> It is closely related to [[4-methylaminorex]]. Aminorex has been shown to have locomotor stimulant effects, lying midway between [[dextroamphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]].  Aminorex effects have been attributed to the release of [[catecholamines]].<ref name="pmid9884392">{{cite journal |author =Fishman AP. |title=Aminorex to fen/phen - An epidemic foretold |journal=Circulation |issue=1 |pages=156â€“161 |date=Jan 1991 |pmid=9884392 |issn=0009-7322 |volume=99 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.99.1.156}}</ref> 

 
The synthesis was first reported in a [[structure-activity relationship]] study of 2-amino-5-aryl-2-oxazolines, where aminorex was found to be approximately 2.5 times more potent than ''D''-amphetamine sulfate in inducing anorexia in rats, and was also reported to have CNS stimulant effects.
