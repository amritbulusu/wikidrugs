'''Istaroxime''' is an investigational drug originally patented and developed by the [[Italy|Italian]] pharmaceutical company Sigma-Tau. Istaroxime is now under development for treatment of acute decompensated heart failure by CVie Therapeutics, a Taiwanese pharmaceutical company owned by Lee's Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited that in July 2012 has acquired from Sigma-Tau the patents and rights on Istaroxime and related compounds. It is still in early-stage development, having been evaluated in phase two clinical trials.<ref name="Shah">Shah, S.J., MD, Blair, J.E.A., Filippatos, G.S., Macarie, C., Ruzyllo, W., Korewicki, J., Bubenek-Turconi, S.I., Ceracchi, M., Bianchetti, M., Carminati, P., Kremastinos, D., Grzybowski, J., Valentini, G., Sabbah, H.N., Gheorghiade, M. 2009.
