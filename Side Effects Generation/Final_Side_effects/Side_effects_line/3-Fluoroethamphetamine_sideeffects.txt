Compared to the unsubstituted [[etilamphetamine|ethylamphetamine]], 3-fluoroethamphetamine is a weaker releaser of noradrenaline, but a stronger releaser of both dopamine and serotonin, and produced the strongest reinforcing effects in animal studies out of a range of 3-substituted ethamphetamine derivatives tested, despite not being the most potent dopamine releaser.<ref>Tessel RE, Woods JH.
