It affects certain species only in the adult stage, but can affect other species at more than one life stage. The species subject to very high rates of mortality as larvae, but not as adults, may gradually be controlled through sustained larval mortality.<ref name=three />  The mode of action of spinosoid insecticides is by a neural mechanism.<ref name=two>{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Nailah|author2=Andrew J.

Spinosoid binding leads to disruption of acetylcholine neurotransmission.<ref name=four /> Spinosad also has secondary effects as a  Ɣ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter agonist.<ref name=four /> It kills insects by hyperexcitation of the insect nervous system.<ref name=four /> Spinosad so far has proven not to cause cross-resistance to any other known insecticide.<ref name=six>{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Thomas|author2=Gary D crouse |author3=Gregory Durst |title=Natural products as insecticides: the biology, biochemistry and quantitative structure-activity relationships of spinosyns and spinosoids|journal=pest manag sci|date=30 March 2001|volume=57|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>

 
An unblinded study performed on groups of 10 rats per dose level run using direct oral doses of commercially prepared insectide found some effects at higher doses, but confirmed that spinosad had much less negative effects than [[malathion]].<ref>S.A.
