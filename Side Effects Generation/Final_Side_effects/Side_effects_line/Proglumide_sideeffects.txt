'''Proglumide''' ('''Milid''') is a [[drug]] that inhibits [[gastrointestinal]] [[motility]] and reduces [[gastric secretion]]s. It acts as a [[cholecystokinin antagonist]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2862828 | year = 1985 | last1 = Bunney | first1 = BS | last2 = Chiodo | first2 = LA | last3 = Freeman | first3 = AS | title = Further studies on the specificity of proglumide as a selective cholecystokinin antagonist in the central nervous system | volume = 448 | pages = 345–51 | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb29929.x}}</ref> which blocks both the [[Cholecystokinin A receptor|CCK<sub>A</sub>]] and [[Cholecystokinin B receptor|CCK<sub>B</sub>]] subtypes.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2005.00239.x | title = Selective CCK-A but not CCK-B receptor antagonists inhibit HT-29 cell proliferation: Synergism with pharmacological levels of melatonin | year = 2005 | last1 = Gonzalez-Puga | first1 = Cristina | last2 = Garcia-Navarro | first2 = Ana | last3 = Escames | first3 = Germaine | last4 = Leon | first4 = Josefa | last5 = Lopez-Cantarero | first5 = Manuel | last6 = Ros | first6 = Eduardo | last7 = Acuna-Castroviejo | first7 = Dario | journal = Journal of Pineal Research | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 243–50 | pmid = 16150104}}</ref> It was used mainly in the treatment of [[stomach ulcers]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7231338 | year = 1981 | last1 = Bergemann | first1 = W | last2 = Consentius | first2 = K | last3 = Braun | first3 = HE | last4 = Hirschmann | first4 = H | last5 = Marowski | first5 = B | last6 = Munck | first6 = A | last7 = Rehs | first7 = HU | last8 = Stopik | first8 = D | last9 = Wilke | first9 = G | title = Duodenal ulcer - multicenter double-blind study with proglumide | volume = 76 | issue = 8 | pages = 226–9 | journal = Medizinische Klinik }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 3572816 | year = 1987 | last1 = Tariq | first1 = M | last2 = Parmar | first2 = NS | last3 = Ageel | first3 = AM | title = Gastric and duodenal antiulcer and cytoprotective effects of proglumide in rats | volume = 241 | issue = 2 | pages = 602–7 | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics}}</ref> although it has now been largely replaced by newer drugs for this application.

 
Proglumide has also been shown to act as a [[delta Opioid receptor|δ-opioid]] agonist, which may contribute to its analgesic effects.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 3030338 | year = 1987 | last1 = Rezvani | first1 = A | last2 = Stokes | first2 = KB | last3 = Rhoads | first3 = DL | last4 = Way | first4 = EL | title = Proglumide exhibits delta opioid agonist properties | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 135–46 | journal = Alcohol and drug research}}</ref>

 
The [[ventral tegmental area]] is the structure believed to mediate proglumides analgesic and euphoric effects, however dozens of areas with a wide range of physical and psychological functions are implicated in the mediation of the placebo effect (this accounts for proglumides ability to produce physically measurable effects on [[vital signs]] such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and [[tidal volume]] which can not be accounted for by its clinically insignificant δ-opioid affinity.
