'''Laropiprant''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) was a drug used in combination with [[niacin]] to reduce blood cholesterol ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] and [[VLDL]]) that is no longer sold, due to increases in side-effects with no cardiovascular benefit. Laropiprant itself has no cholesterol lowering effect, but it reduces facial [[Flushing (physiology)|flushes]] induced by niacin.

The Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-THRIVE) involved more than 25,000 adults. The treatment group received 2 g of extended-release niacin and 40&nbsp;mg of laropiprant daily. Study results, reported in July 2014, showed that the combination of niacin and laropiprant did not have any beneficial effects when compared with a [[placebo]] treatment and had an increase in adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal
