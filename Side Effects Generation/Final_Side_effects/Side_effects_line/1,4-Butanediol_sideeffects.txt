==Health effects and use as a drug==

 
1,4-Butanediol is also used as a [[recreational drug]] known by some users as "One Comma Four", "Liquid Fantasy", "One Four Bee" or "One Four B-D-O". It exerts effects similar to [[gamma-hydroxybutyrate|γ-hydroxybutyrate]] (GHB), which is a metabolic product of 1,4-butanediol.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Satta | first1 = Rosalba | last2 = Dimitrijevic | first2 = Nikola | last3 = Manev | first3 = Hari | year = 2003 | title = ''Drosophila'' metabolize 1,4-butanediol into γ-hydroxybutyric acid in vivo | journal = Eur.

1,4-Butanediol is converted into [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] by the enzymes [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] and differing levels of these enzymes may account for differences in effects and [[side effects]] between users.<ref name="Benzer">{{citation | last1 = Benzer | first1 = Theodore I. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = Scott | last3 = Russi | first3 = Christopher Scott  | date = 8 January 2007 | title = Toxicity, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate | url = http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic848.htm | publisher = [[eMedicine]] | accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref> While co-administration of [[ethanol]] and GHB already poses serious risks, co-administration of [[ethanol]] with 1,4-butanediol will interact considerably and has many other potential risks. This is because the same enzymes that are responsible for metabolizing alcohol also metabolize 1,4-butanediol so there is a strong chance of a dangerous [[drug interaction]].<ref name="Benzer"/><ref name="Poldrugo">{{citation | last1 = Poldrugo | first1 = Flavio | last2 = Snead | first2= O.

1,4-Butanediol seems to have two types of pharmacological actions. The major psychoactive effects of 1,4-butanediol are because it is metabolized into GHB; however there is a study suggesting that 1,4-butanediol may have potential alcohol-like pharmacological effects that are not due to this conversion.<ref name="Poldrugo"/> The study arrived at this conclusion based on the finding that 1,4-butanediol co-administered with ethanol led to potentiation of some of the behavioral effects of ethanol. However, potentiation of ethanol's effects may simply be caused by competition for the [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] enzymes with co-administered 1,4-butanediol. The shared metabolic rate-limiting steps thus leads to slowed metabolism and clearance for both compounds including ethanol's known toxic metabolite [[acetaldehyde]].

 
Another study found no effect following intracerebroventricular injection in rats of 1,4-butanediol.<ref>{{Citation | pmid = 17100847 | year = 2006 | last1 = Carter | first1 = LP | last2 = Koek | first2 = W | last3 = France | first3 = CP | title = Lack of effects of GHB precursors GBL and 1,4-BD following i.c.v.

Like [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], 1,4-butanediol is only safe in small amounts. Adverse effects in higher doses include, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sedation, vertigo, and potentially death if ingested in large amounts. Anxiolytic effects are diminished and side effects increased when used in combination with alcohol.
