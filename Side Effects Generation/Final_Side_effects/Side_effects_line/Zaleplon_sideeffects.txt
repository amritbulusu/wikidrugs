When compared with [[benzodiazepines]], nonbenzodiazepines (including zaleplon) appear to offer few significant advantages in efficacy or tolerability among elderly individuals. Long-term use of sedative/hypnotics for insomnia has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, [[anterograde amnesia]], daytime sedation, musculoskeletal impairment, and subsequently an increased risk of harm to oneself (e.g. falling) and to others (e.g. [[Traffic collision|automotive accidents]]). Though, quite obviously as the body and brain age, these aforementioned phenomena are expected events, as they occur daily regardless of ingestion of a sedative/hypnotic. Thus, statistically significant and empirical evidence are arguably still absent as dramatic precautions and conclusions are drawn irrespective of the debilitating realities that accompany insomnia and the fact that these medicines do indeed provide assistance to millions of elderly individuals. It is important to distinguish between the extrapolation of potential side effects relative to the vast number of examples, wherein the sedative/hypnotic has proven therapeutically beneficial and appropriate.

The side effects of zaleplon are similar to the side effects of benzodiazepines, although with less next-day sedation,<ref name="Wagner J 1998 680–91">{{cite journal | doi =10.1345/aph.17111 | journal =Ann Pharmacother |date=June 1998 | pages =680–91  | title =Beyond benzodiazepines: alternative pharmacologic agents for the treatment of insomnia | author =Wagner J |author2=Wagner ML |author3=Hening WA  | pmid =9640488 | volume =32 | issue =6 }}</ref> and in two studies zaleplon use was found not to cause an increase in traffic accidents, as compared to other [[hypnotics]] currently on the market.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Menzin J, Lang KM, Levy P, Levy E |title=A general model of the effects of sleep medications on the risk and cost of [[motor vehicle accidents]] and its application to France |journal=PharmacoEconomics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=69–78 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11252547 |doi= 10.2165/00019053-200119010-00005|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vermeeren A, Riedel WJ, van Boxtel MP, Darwish M, Paty I, Patat A |title=Differential residual effects of zaleplon and zopiclone on actual driving: a comparison with a low dose of alcohol |journal=Sleep |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=224–31 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11905433 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

 
Some evidence suggests zaleplon is not as chemically reinforcing and exhibits far fewer [[rebound effects]] when compared with other nonbenzodiazepines, or [[Z-drug]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lader MH |title=Implications of hypnotic flexibility on patterns of clinical use |journal=Int J Clin Pract Suppl |volume= |issue=116 |pages=14–9 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11219327 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

 
Zaleplon selectively binds with high efficacy to the [[benzodiazepine site]] (ω<sub>1</sub>) on the α<sub>1</sub>-containing [[GABA-A receptors]] which help produce the primary therapeutic hypnotic properties. The ultrashort [[half-life]] gives zaleplon a unique advantage over other hypnotics because of its lack of next-day residual effects on driving and other performance-related skills.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Patat A, Paty I, Hindmarch I |title=Pharmacodynamic profile of Zaleplon, a new non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent |journal=Hum Psychopharmacol |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=369–392 |date=July 2001 |pmid=12404558 |doi=10.1002/hup.310}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowlett JK, Spealman RD, Lelas S, Cook JM, Yin W |title=Discriminative stimulus effects of zolpidem in squirrel monkeys: role of GABA(A)/alpha1 receptors |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=165 |issue=3 |pages=209–15 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12420154 |doi=10.1007/s00213-002-1275-z |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/392vkmeej4at9yuy/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Unlike nonselective benzodiazepine drugs and zopiclone, which distort the [[sleep pattern]], zaleplon appears to induce sleep without disrupting the natural [[sleep architecture]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Noguchi H, Kitazumi K, Mori M, Shiba T |title=Binding and neuropharmacological profile of zaleplon, a novel nonbenzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic |journal=Eur.

Zaleplon has a pharmacological profile similar to benzodiazepines, characterized by an increase in slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) with rapid onset of hypnotic action. Zaleplon is a full agonist for the benzodiazepine α<sub>1</sub> receptor located on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex in the body, with lower affinity for the α<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> subsites. It selectively enhances the action of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] similar to, but more selectively than benzodiazepines. Zaleplon, although not a benzodiazepine, maintains a very similar [[chemical structure]] nonetheless, known for inducing hypnotic effects by α<sub>1</sub> subreceptor sites, anxiolytic, and [[muscle relaxant]] effects via α<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> subsites, with negligible [[anticonvulsant]] properties (via α<sub>5</sub> subsite), as zaleplon action is [[modulated]] at benzodiazepine receptor sites. The [[elimination half-life]] of zaleplon is about 1–1.5 hours. The absorption rate of zaleplon is rapid and the onset of therapeutic effects is typically breached within 5–15 minutes following ingestion.

 
[[Cimetidine]] and [[Grapefruit drug interactions|grapefruit]] are known to increase [[blood plasma]] concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by the P450 [[CYP3A4]] [[liver enzyme]] (e.g. [[alprazolam]]) by extending the time by which the drug leaves the body, effectively extending the [[half-life]] and enhancing effects to potentially toxic levels. Thus, given the similarities between zaleplon and benzodiazepines, particularly in effect, and not just chemical structure, it is reasonable to take precautions (e.g. inquire at a pharmacy) before one consumes cimetidine (or grapefruit) while also taking zaleplon.

 
Zaleplon has the potential to be a drug of recreational use, and has been found to have an addictive potential similar to benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=6299|title=Sonata®(zaleplon)Capsules|publisher=}}</ref> The mind- and judgment-altering effects of zaleplon are similar to those of many benzodiazepines, but the fast-acting nature and short half-life of the chemical mean high doses set on much more quickly and last for short periods of time (usually from 45 to 60 minutes).

 
Some individuals use a different delivery method than prescribed, such as [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]], to induce effects faster.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Paparrigopoulos T, Tzavellas E, Karaiskos D, Liappas I |title=Intranasal Zaleplon Abuse |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=165 |issue=11 |pages=1489–1490 |year=2008 |pmid=18981079

 
A common effect of recreational zaleplon use is the occurrence of (typically short-lived) [[hallucinations]]. Fewer visual and auditory hallucinations/disruptions occur with the use of zaleplon than with other [[Z-drug]]s, like [[zolpidem]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  [[Anterograde amnesia]] can occur and can cause one to lose track of the amount of zaleplon already ingested, prompting the ingesting of more than originally planned.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Psychopharmacology |date=Jul 1999 | pages=39–51 | title=Zaleplon and triazolam in humans: acute behavioral effects and abuse potential | author=Rush CR |author2=Frey JM |author3=Griffiths RR  | pmid=10445371 | doi=10.1007/s002130051030 | volume=145 | issue=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Drug Alcohol Depend | year=2000 | pages=55–68 | title=Zaleplon and triazolam: drug discrimination, plasma levels, and self-administration in baboons | author=Ator NA | pmid=11064184 | doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(00)00123-X | volume=61 | issue=1 }}</ref> However, continuous ingestion is extremely unlikely precisely because of zaleplon's quick onset of action.
