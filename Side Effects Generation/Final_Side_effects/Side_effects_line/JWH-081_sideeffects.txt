'''JWH-081''' is an [[analgesic]] chemical from the [[naphthoylindole]] family, which acts as a [[cannabinoid]] agonist at both the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors.<ref>Aung MM, ''et al.'' Influence of the N-1 alkyl chain length of cannabimimetic indoles upon CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptor binding. ''Drug and Alcohol Dependence'' 2000; 60:133-140.</ref> With a [[dissociation constant|K<sub>i</sub>]] of 1.2nM it is fairly selective for the CB<sub>1</sub> subtype, its affinity at this subtype approximately 10x the affinity at CB<sub>2</sub>.<ref>Huffman JW, ''et al.''
