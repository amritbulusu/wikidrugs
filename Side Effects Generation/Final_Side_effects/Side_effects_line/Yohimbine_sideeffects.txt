Yohimbine is a drug used in veterinary medicine to reverse the effects of [[xylazine]] in dogs and deer.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=522.2670 21 CFR Sec. 522.2670 Yohimbine]</ref>

 
Depending on dosage, yohimbine can either increase or decrease systemic blood pressure (through [[vasoconstriction]] or [[vasodilation]], respectively). Because yohimbine has highest affinity for the α<sub>2</sub> receptor, small doses can increase blood pressure by causing a relatively selective α<sub>2</sub> blockade. Yohimbine also, however, interacts with α<sub>1</sub> receptors, albeit with lower affinity; therefore, at higher doses an α<sub>1</sub> blockade can occur and overwhelm the effects of the α<sub>2</sub> blockade, leading to a potentially dangerous drop in blood pressure.<ref name="MedlineSupplement">{{cite web|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/yohimbe|title=Yohimbe  Supplement|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-08-28}} </ref>

 
Higher doses of oral yohimbine may create numerous side effects, such as [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]], overstimulation, anomalous blood pressure, cold sweating, and [[insomnia]].
