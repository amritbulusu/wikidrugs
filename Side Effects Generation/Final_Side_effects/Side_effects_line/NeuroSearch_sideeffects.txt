In 2006, three drug candidates from a novel class of compounds the company refers to as [[pridopidine#Dopaminergic stabilizers|dopaminergic stabilizers]] were added to the development pipeline through the acquisition of Carlsson Research AB, a privately owned Swedish company. In 2010, NeuroSearch reported the results of [[pridopidine#Huntexil clinical development programme|MermaiHD]] ('''M'''ultinational '''E'''u'''R'''opean '''M'''ulticentre '''A'''CR16 study '''I'''n '''H'''untington’s '''D'''isease), the first study in the Huntexil [[Clinical trial#Phase III|phase 3]] programme.
