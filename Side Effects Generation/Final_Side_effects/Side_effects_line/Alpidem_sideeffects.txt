'''Alpidem''' ('''Ananxyl''') is an [[anxiolytic]] drug from the [[imidazopyridine]] family, related to the more well known sleeping medication [[zolpidem]]. Unlike zolpidem however, alpidem does not produce [[sedative]] effects at normal doses, and is instead used specifically for the treatment of [[anxiety]].<ref>Zivkovic B, Morel E, Joly D, Perrault G, Sanger DJ, Lloyd KG.

Alpidem was generally prescribed to patients with moderate-to-severe [[anxiety]].<ref>Kunovac JL, Stahl SM. Future directions in anxiolytic pharmacotherapy. ''Psychiatric Clinics of North America''. 1995 Dec;18(4):895-909.</ref> Most of these patients had exhibited either [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensitivity]] or [[drug resistance|resistance]] to [[benzodiazepine]] therapy, and therefore switched to a non-benzodiazepine medication due to the reduced incidence of side effects relative to benzodiazepine drugs.<ref>Morton S, Lader M. Studies with alpidem in normal volunteers and anxious patients. ''Pharmacopsychiatry''. 1990 May;23 Suppl 3:120-3.</ref><ref>Frattola L, Garreau M, Piolti R, Bassi S, Albizzati MG, Borghi C, Morselli PL. Comparison of the efficacy, safety and withdrawal of alpidem and alprazolam in anxious patients. ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]''. 1994 Jul;165(2):94-100.</ref> Alpidem produced little or no [[sedative]] or [[hypnotic]] action at normal doses but may have produced sedation when used at a high dose, and only had [[anticonvulsant]] actions at much higher doses than those used clinically for the treatment of anxiety.<ref>Zivkovic B, Morel E, Joly D, Perrault G, Sanger DJ, Lloyd KG.
