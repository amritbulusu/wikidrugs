| title = Effects of the enterokinetic prucalopride (R093877) on colonic motility in fasted dogs 

 
The observed effects are exerted via highly selective action on 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors:<ref name="SmPC" /> prucalopride has >150-fold higher affinity for 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors than for other receptors.<ref name="Briejer" /><ref name="DeMaeyer">{{cite journal|last1=De Maeyer|first1=JH|last2=Lefebvre|first2=RA|last3=Schuurkes|first3=JA|title=5-HT(4) receptor agonists: similar but not the same|journal=Neurogastroenterol Motil|date=Feb 2008|volume=20|issue=2|pages=99â€“112|pmid=18199093|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2982.2007.01059.x}}</ref> Prucalopride differs from other 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonists such as [[tegaserod]] and [[cisapride]], which at therapeutic concentrations also  interact with other receptors (5-HT<sub>1B/D</sub> and the cardiac [[hERG|human ether-a-go-go K<sup>+</sup> or hERG channel]] respectively) and this may account for the adverse [[cardiovascular]] events that have resulted in the restricted availability of these drugs.<ref name="DeMaeyer" /> [[Clinical trials]] evaluating the effect of prucalopride on QT interval and related adverse events have not demonstrated significant differences compared with placebo.<ref name="SmPC" />

 
== Side effects ==

 
Prucalopride has been given orally to ~2700 patients with chronic constipation in controlled clinical trials. The most frequently reported side effects are [[headache]] and [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s (abdominal pain, [[nausea]] or [[diarrhea]]). Such reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment.<ref name="SmPC" />
