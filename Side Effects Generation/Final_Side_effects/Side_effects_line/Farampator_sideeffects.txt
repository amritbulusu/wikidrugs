Farampator has been investigated for its effect on [[AMPA receptor]]s and researched for potential use in the treatment of schizophrenia and [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. It was found to improve short-term memory, but impaired episodic memory. It produced side effects such as headache, somnolence and nausea. Subjects reporting side effects had significantly higher plasma levels of farampator than subjects without.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Additional analyses revealed that in the farampator condition the group without side effects showed a significantly superior memory performance relative to the group with side effects.  <ref>Wezenberg E, Verkes RJ, Ruigt GS, Hulstijn W, Sabbe BG.
