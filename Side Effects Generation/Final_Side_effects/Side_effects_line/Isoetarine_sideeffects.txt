All of the early β<sub>2</sub> agonist catecholamines used for bronchospasm had strong side effects, with [[Tachycardia|increase in heart rate]] as the most common and most problematic. This came because its "β<sub>2</sub> effect" was not quite as selective as might be hoped. [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub> receptor]]s appeared to also be stimulated in some patients, causing cardiac and other CNS side effects. With isoetarine this effect tended to be transient and usually went away within a matter of minutes after the end of the treatment. [[Hypertension|Increase in blood pressure]] also occurred in a small but significant percentage of cases, but also was almost invariably transient.
