Besipirdine was first considered for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder ([[OCD]]).  [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]] (Hoecst AG) filed a patent in July 1993 protecting the use of N-(pyridinyl)-1H-indol-1-amines, including besipirdine, for the treatment of OCD, supported by preliminary data gathered from rat studies {{cite patent |country=US |number=5356910 A |status=patent}}.  In 1995, Hoechst AG filed a patent protecting the production of besipirdine, this time describing its memory-enhancing, analgetic and antidepressant qualities {{cite patent |country=US |number=5459274 A|status=patent}} .  With increasing research on besipirdine uncovering its effects on the cholinergic system, Hoechst AG filed a patent in the following year to protect substituted n-(pyrrol-1-yl)pyridinamines as anticonvulsant agents

Under the new company Aventis, besipirdine ultimately failed in Phase III clinical trials due to severe cardiovascular side effects observed in a few patients in separate studies.<ref name = Huff>{{cite journal

== Adverse Effects ==

 
Besipirdine is reported to be well-tolerated.  More severe adverse effects, such as bradycardia and postural hypotension, may have been a result of a high ratio of adrenergic to cholinergic potency caused by the metabolite P86-7480, which has direct vasoconstrictor effects.<ref name = Huff>{{cite journal
