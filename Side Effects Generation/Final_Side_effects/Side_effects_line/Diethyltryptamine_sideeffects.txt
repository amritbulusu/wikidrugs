'''DET''', also known under its chemical name '''''N'',''N''-diethyltryptamine''' and as '''T-9''',<ref name="titleErowid DET Vault : Chemistry">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/det/det_chemistry.shtml |title=Erowid DET Vault : Chemistry |accessdate=2008-01-08 |work=}}</ref> is a [[psychedelic drug]] closely related to [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[4-HO-DET]]. However, despite its [[Analog (chemistry)|structural similarity]] to DMT, its activity is induced by an oral dose of around 50–100 [[Milligram|mg]], without the aid of [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitors]], and the effects last for about 2–4 hours.

 
The mechanism of action is thought to be [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]] [[agonist|agonism]], much like other [[Psychedelic drug#Examples|classic psychedelics]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Winter JC |title=Behavioral effects of N,N-diethyltryptamine: absence of antagonism by xylamidine tosylate |journal=J.
