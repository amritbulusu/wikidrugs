The approved dosing regimen for iloprost is 6 to 9 times daily (no more than every 2 hours) during waking hours, according to individual need and tolerability. The significant clinical effects observed in the pivotal study of patients with PAH were achieved with a median dose of 30&nbsp;µg per day (range: 12.5 to 45&nbsp;µg delivered at the mouthpiece), corresponding to 6 daily inhalations of 5&nbsp;µg. The majority of patients (>&nbsp;80%) in the pivotal study used this median dose or a higher dose with an excellent treatment compliance after 12 weeks.

 
IV iloprost is usually administered diluted, via a peripheral vein or central venous catheter.  The diluted iloprost should be delivered by an accurate rate delivery system such as a syringe driver.  Doses vary with individuals as side effects are better tolerated by some patients than others.  The duration of the treatment is typically 3 days.  This is usually repeated every 8 to 12 weeks <ref name=autogenerated1 />
