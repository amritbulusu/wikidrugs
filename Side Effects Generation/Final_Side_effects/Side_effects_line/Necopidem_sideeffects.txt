'''Necopidem''' is a drug in the [[imidazopyridine]] family, which is related to the better known drugs [[zolpidem]] and [[alpidem]]. It is therefore considered a [[nonbenzodiazepine]] and as such may have [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects, given its structural similarity to other nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ethyl 8-(4-nitrophenyl)imidazo[1,2-''a'']pyridine-7-carboxylate |date=2010-12-01 |pmc=3011613 |journal=Acta Crystallographica Section E |volume=66 |number=12 |last1=Duan |first1=Gui-Yun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yu-Juan |last3=Hao |first3=Ben-Qian |pmid=21589555 |doi=10.1107/S1600536810047938 |pages=o3272}}</ref>
