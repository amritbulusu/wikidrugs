Norclostebol is a 4-chloro derivative of testosterone. It works out to be significantly stronger than pure testosterone. It is approximately 6.6 times as anabolic while only 40% as androgenic. This may not be a particularly fair or valid comparison however. It is more appropriate to compare norclostebol to testosterone propionate due to the use of an ester. In this case they are fairly even in anabolic potency at 112%  but only 20â€“25% as androgenic. In practice this means norclostebol is a potent anabolic compound with minimal tendency towards side effects.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}
