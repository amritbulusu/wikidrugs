In medical research, DMSO is often used as a drug vehicle in ''[[in vivo]]'' and ''[[in vitro]]'' experiments. However, when a researcher is unaware of its [[Pleiotropy (drugs)|pleiotropic]] effects, or when the control groups are not carefully planned, a bias can occur; an effect of DMSO can be falsely attributed to the drug.<ref name=" kelava ">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kelava T, Cavar I | title = Biological actions of drug solvents | journal = Periodicum Biologorum | volume = 113 | issue = 3| pages = 311–320 |date=Nov 2011 | pmid = | doi = | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/74090}}</ref> For example, even a very low dose of DMSO has a powerful protective effect against [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen)-induced liver injury in mice.<ref name=" PMID 20962895 ">{{cite journal | author = Kelava T, Cavar I | title = Influence of small doses of various drug vehicles on acetaminophen-induced liver injury | journal = Can J Physiol Pharmacol | volume = 88 | issue = 10 | pages = 980–87 |date=Oct 2010 | doi = 10.1139/Y10-065| pmid = 20962895| last2 = Cavar | last3 = Culo }}</ref>

 
The use of DMSO as an alternative treatment for cancer is of particular concern, as it has been shown to interfere with a variety of [[chemotherapy]] drugs, including [[cisplatin]], [[carboplatin]], and [[oxaliplatin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=M.

Early clinical trials with DMSO were stopped because of questions about its safety, especially its ability to harm the eye. The most commonly reported side effects include headaches and burning and itching on contact with the skin. Strong allergic reactions have been reported.{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}} DMSO can cause contaminants, toxins, and medicines to be absorbed through the skin, which may cause unexpected effects. DMSO is thought to increase the effects of blood thinners, steroids, heart medicines, sedatives, and other drugs. In some cases this could be harmful or dangerous.<ref name=ACS>[http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/dmso DMSO] information from [[American Cancer Society]]</ref> It is a developmental neurotoxin.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19100327 | year = 2009 | last1 = Hanslick | first1 = JL | last2 = Lau | first2 = K | last3 = Noguchi | first3 = KK | last4 = Olney | first4 = JW | last5 = Zorumski | first5 = CF | last6 = Mennerick | first6 = S | last7 = Farber | first7 = NB | title = Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) produces widespread apoptosis in the developing central nervous system | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.nbd.2008.11.006 | pmc = 2682536 | journal = Neurobiology of disease}}</ref>
