'''Menitrazepam'''<ref>{{cite patent | country = DE | number = 2017060}}</ref> is a drug which is a [[benzodiazepine]] derivative.<ref>[http://www.psychotropics.dk/moleculeView/default.aspx?ID=1440&Catalogtype=A&ChapterID=1&Thissortorder=37 Lundbeck Institute: Psychotropics]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18962241 |date=Apr 1978 |last1=Volke |first1=J |last2=Ellaithy |last3=Manousek |title=A spectrophotometric and polarographic investigation of three new cyclohexene-substituted benzodiazepines |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=209â€“13 |issn=0039-9140 |journal=Talanta |doi=10.1016/0039-9140(78)80006-X |first2=MM |first3=O }}</ref> It is similar in structure to [[tetrazepam]] and [[nimetazepam]], with the 7-chloro group of tetrazepam replaced by nitro. It is a hypnotic agent used in the treatment of [[insomnia]], and therefore has strong [[sedative]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[muscle relaxant]], and [[anxiolytic]] actions like those of other hypnotic benzodiazepines. Menitrazepam is a good oral hypnotic agent, however, delay in the time for peak plasma levels to reach their maximum brings into question the benefit of menitrazepam for the treatment of insomnia when compared to other hypnotics. Typically, the [[Sleep induction|sleep inducing]] properties of hypnotics occur within 0.5 hours. In some cases, as with temazepam and nitrazepam, strong hypnotic effects can be felt 15 to 20 minutes after oral ingestion.
