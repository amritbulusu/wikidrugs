Serotonin is a neurotransmitter and is found in all [[bilateria|bilateral animals]], where it mediates gut movements and the animal's perceptions of resource availability.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In less complex animals, such as some [[invertebrates]], resources simply mean food availability. In more complex animals, such as [[arthropod]]s and [[vertebrate]]s, resources also can mean social dominance. In response to the perceived abundance or scarcity of resources, an animal's growth, reproduction or [[mood (psychology)|mood]] may be elevated or lowered. This may somewhat depend on how much serotonin the organism has at its disposal.<ref>[http://www.livestrong.com/article/154361-effects-of-serotonin-on-the-body/ Coila, Bridgett.

===Cellular effects===

 
The [[5-HT receptor]]s, the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for serotonin, are located on the cell membrane of [[Neuron|nerve cells]] and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the [[endogenous]] [[ligand]] and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drugs]]. Except for the [[5-HT3|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor]], a ligand-gated [[ion channel]], all other 5-HT receptors are [[G-protein-coupled receptors]] (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an [[intracellular]] [[second messenger]] cascade.<ref name="pmid18571247">{{cite journal|author = Hannon J, Hoyer D|title = Molecular biology of 5-HT receptors|journal = Behav.

Serotonin can also signal through a nonreceptor mechanism called serotonylation, in which serotonin modifies proteins.<ref name="pmid19859528"/> This process underlies serotonin's effects upon platelet-forming cells ([[thrombocyte]]s) in which it links to the modification of signaling enzymes called [[GTPase]]s that then trigger the release of vesicle contents by [[exocytosis]].<ref name="pmid14697203">{{cite journal|author = Walther DJ, Peter JU, Winter S, Höltje M, Paulmann N, Grohmann M, Vowinckel J, Alamo-Bethencourt V, Wilhelm CS, Ahnert-Hilger G, Bader M|title = Serotonylation of small GTPases is a signal transduction pathway that triggers platelet alpha-granule release|journal = Cell|volume = 115|issue = 7|pages = 851–62|year = 2003|pmid = 14697203|doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)01014-6|last2 = Peter|last3 = Winter|last4 = Höltje|last5 = Paulmann|last6 = Grohmann|last7 = Vowinckel|last8 = Alamo-Bethencourt|last9 = Wilhelm|last10 = Ahnert-Hilger|last11 = Bader}}</ref> A similar process underlies the pancreatic release of insulin.<ref name="pmid19859528"/>

Drugs that alter serotonin levels are used in treating [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]]. [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) prevent the breakdown of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (including serotonin), and therefore increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the brain. MAOI therapy is associated with many adverse drug reactions, and patients are at risk of [[hypertensive emergency]] triggered by foods with high [[tyramine]] content, and certain drugs. Some drugs inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, making it stay in the synaptic cleft longer. The [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and [[norepinephrine]]. The newer [[selective and non-selective|selective]] serotonin reuptake inhibitors ([[SSRI]]s) have fewer side-effects and fewer interactions with other drugs.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Louis S.

Extremely high levels of serotonin can cause a condition known as [[serotonin syndrome]], with toxic and potentially fatal effects.

Serotonin functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of most animals. For example, in the roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', which feeds on bacteria, serotonin is released as a signal in response to positive events, such as finding a new source of food or in male animals finding a female with which to mate.<ref>Jonz, Michael G.Riga, EkateriniMercier, A.
