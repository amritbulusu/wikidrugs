It produces effects in animals similar to those of [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), a cannabinoid naturally present in cannabis, leading to its use in [[synthetic cannabis]] products such as "legal cannabis herbal incense blends" which in some countries are sold legally as "incense", labeled "not for human consumption".<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zimmermann US, Winkelmann PR, Pilhatsch M, Nees JA, Spanagel R, Schulz K | title = Withdrawal Phenomena and Dependence Syndrome After the Consumption of "Spice Gold" | journal = Dtsch Arztebl Int | volume = 106 | issue = 27 | pages = 464–467 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19652769 | pmc = 2719097 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2009.0464 }}</ref><ref name="Aung">{{cite journal |vauthors=Aung MM, Griffin G, Huffman JW, Wu M, Keel C, Yang B, Showalter VM, Abood ME, Martin BR | title = Influence of the N-1 alkyl chain length of cannabimimetic indoles upon CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptor binding | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–140 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10940540 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-8716(99)00152-0 | url = https://ewsd.wiv-isp.be/Publications%20on%20new%20psychoactive%20substances/JWH-019/Aung_2000_Alkyl%20chain___E972455D-F1B9-789D-E2A7D189115CD29F.pdf | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>{{US patent reference |number=6900236 |y=2005 |m=05 |d=31 |inventor=Alexandros Makriyannis, Hongfeng Deng |title=Cannabimimetic indole derivatives }}</ref><ref>{{US patent reference |number=7241799 |y=2007 |m=07 |d=10 |inventor=Alexandros Makriyannis, Hongfeng Deng |title=Cannabimimetic indole derivatives }}</ref><ref name="wiley1">{{cite journal | last1 = Atwood | first1 = B.K. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010 | title = JWH018, a common constituent of 'Spice' herbal blends, is a potent and efficacious cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123251380/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 | journal = [[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 160 | issue = 3| pages = 585–593 | doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00582.x}}</ref>

 
JWH-018 is a full agonist of both the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> cannabinoid receptors, with a reported binding affinity of 9.00&nbsp;±&nbsp;5.00&nbsp;nM at CB<sub>1</sub> and 2.94&nbsp;±&nbsp;2.65&nbsp;nM at CB<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="Aung"/> JWH-018 has an [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] of 102&nbsp;nM for human CB<sub>1</sub> receptors, and 133 nM for human CB<sub>2</sub> receptors.<ref name = "ACS 2015">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acschemneuro.5b00107| title = Effects of Bioisosteric Fluorine in Synthetic Cannabinoid Designer Drugs JWH-018, AM-2201, UR-144, XLR-11, PB-22, 5F-PB-22, APICA, and STS-135| journal = ACS Chemical Neuroscience| pages = 150508124201002| year = 2015| last1 = Banister | first1 = S.

At least one case of JWH-018 dependence has been reported by the media.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The user consumed JWH-018 daily for eight months.  Withdrawal symptoms were similar to those experienced as a result of [[cannabis dependence]]. JWH-018 has been shown to cause profound changes in CB<sub>1</sub> receptor density following administration, causing desensitization to its effects more rapidly than related cannabinoids.<ref name="wiley1"/>

 
Various physical and psychological adverse effects have been reported from JWH-018 use. One study reported psychotic relapses and anxiety symptoms in well-treated patients with mental illness following JWH-018 inhalation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Every-Palmer | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = Synthetic cannabinoid use and psychosis: an explorative study | url = | journal = Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = | issue = | page = }}</ref> Due to concerns about the potential of JWH-018 and other synthetic cannabinoids to cause psychosis in vulnerable individuals, it has been recommended that people with risk factors for psychotic illnesses (like a past or family history of psychosis) not use these substances.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Every-Palmer S | title = WARNING: LEGAL SYNTHETIC CANNABINOID-RECEPTOR AGONISTS SUCH AS JWH-018 MAY PRECIPITATE PSYCHOSIS IN VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS | journal = Addiction | volume = 105 | pages = 1859–1860 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20840203 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03119.x }}</ref>
