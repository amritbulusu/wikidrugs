'''Triclosan''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''TCS'''), similar in its uses and mechanism of action to [[triclocarban]], is an [[antibiotic|antibacterial]] and [[fungus|antifungal]] agent found in some consumer products, including toothpaste, [[soap]]s, [[detergent]]s, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an [[antimicrobial agent]], the risk of [[antimicrobial resistance]], and its possible role in [[endocrine disruptor|disrupted hormonal development]] remain controversial. Additional research seeks to understand its potential effects on organisms and environmental health.

 
Once absorbed, triclosan is metabolized by humans primarily through conjugation reactions into [[glucuronide]] and [[sulfate conjugates]] that are excreted in feces and urine. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that triclosan sulfate and glucuronide may be formed in the liver at approximately equal rates at the environmentally relevant concentration of 1 to 5 microMolar. When concentrations of triclosan are below 1 microMolar, [[sulfonation]] is expected to be the major metabolic pathway for elimination.<ref name="annualreviews.org">Yueh, M., Tukey, R. H.

Because of potential health concerns spanning from antimicrobial resistance to endocrine disruption, triclosan has been designated as a "contaminant of emerging concern (CEC)", meaning it is under investigation for public health risk.  "Emerging contaminants" can be broadly defined as any synthetic or naturally occurring chemical or any microorganism that is not commonly monitored in the environment but has the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological and(or) human health effects.<ref>United States Geological Survey.  Contaminants of Emerging Concern in the Environment.

Concerns on the health effects of triclosan have been raised after it was detected in human breast milk, blood, and urine samples. While no human data exists, studies on rats have shown that triclosan exposure modulates estrogen-dependent responses.<ref>"Triclosan exposure modulates estrogen-dependent responses in the female wistar rat." Toxicol Sci. 2010 Sep;117(1):45-53. {{doi|10.1093/toxsci/kfq180}}.</ref> There have been many studies performed over the years both in vivo and in vitro, in male and female fish and rats and they all support the conclusion that triclosan possesses (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic properties depending on species, tissues, and cell types.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/>

 
[[Global warming]] may increase uptake and effects of triclosan in aquatic organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Accumulation of triclosan from diet and its neuroendocrine effects in Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) under two temperature Regimes|year=2015|doi=10.1016/j.marenvres.2015.09.006|journal=Marine Environmental Research|authors=Tiffany L.

Nonorganic antibiotics and organic biocides are effective alternatives to triclosan, such as silver and copper ions and [[nanoparticle]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nano.2006.12.001 |pmid= 17379174|title=Antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles |journal=Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine |volume=3 |pages=S137–47 |year=2007 |last1=Kim |first1=Jun Sung |last2=Kuk |first2=Eunye |last3=Yu |first3=Kyeong Nam |last4=Kim |first4=Jong-Ho |last5=Park |first5=Sung Jin |last6=Lee |first6=Hu Jang |last7=Kim |first7=So Hyun |last8=Park |first8=Young Kyung |last9=Park |first9=Yong Ho |last10=Hwang |first10=Cheol-Yong |last11=Kim |first11=Yong-Kwon |last12=Lee |first12=Yoon-Sik |last13=Jeong |first13=Dae Hong |last14=Cho |first14=Myung-Haing}}</ref>

 
In 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council forced the FDA to review triclosan after suing them for their inaction. Because the FDA prohibited [[hexachlorophene]], a compound similar to triclosan, Halden and others argued that the FDA should also ban triclosan.<ref name=halden/> On December 17, 2013, the FDA issued a draft rule revoking the [[Generally recognized as safe]] status of triclosan as an ingredient in hand wash products, citing the need for additional studies of its potential endrocrine and developmental effects; impact on bacterial resistance; and carcinogenic potential.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-17/pdf/2013-29814.pdf |title=Federal Register |accessdate=2014-09-22}}</ref>

 
In light of mounting evidence on the human health and ecotoxic effects of triclosan, some companies reformulated to remove it in advance of regulation: Colgate-Palmolive removed it from Palmolive Dish Soap and Softsoap in 2011 (but it remains in Colgate Total toothpaste); Johnson & Johnson removed it from baby products in 2012 and all products in 2015; Procter & Gamble from all products in 2014; In 2014 it was removed from Clearasil and Avon began phasing it out; and Unilever removed it from skin care and cleansing products in 2015, and says oral care by 2017.<ref>Kary, Tiffany.
