Experimental studies on rats and dogs, proved the efficacy and mechanism of action of omecamtiv mecarbil.<ref name=Shen2010/>  Current clinical studies on humans have shown there is a direct linear relationship between dose and systolic ejection time.<ref name=Teerlink2009/><ref name=Teerlink2011>{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Teerlink JR, Clarke CP, Saikali KG, Lee JH, Chen MM, Escandon RD, Elliott L, Bee R, Habibzadeh MR, Goldman JH, Schiller NB, Malik FI, Wolff AA | title = Dose-dependent augmentation of cardiac systolic function with the selective cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil: a first-in-man study. | journal = Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9792 | pages = 667–75 |date=Aug 2011 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61219-1 | PMID = 21856480 }}</ref><ref name=Cleland>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Cleland JG, Teerlink JR, Senior R, Nifontov EM, Mc Murray JJ, Lang CC, Tsyrlin VA, Greenberg BH, Mayet J, Francis DP, Shaburishvili T, Monaghan M, Saltzberg M, Neyses L, Wasserman SM, Lee JH, Saikali KG, Clarke CP, Goldman JH, Wolff AA, Malik FI | title = The effects of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, on cardiac function in systolic heart failure: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-ranging phase 2 trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9792 | pages = 676–83 |date=Aug 2011 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61126-4 | PMID = 21856481 }}</ref>  The dose-dependent effects persisted throughout the entire trial, suggesting that [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]] does not occur.  The maximum tolerated dose was observed to be an infusion of 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg/h.  Adverse effects, such as ischemia, were only seen at doses beyond this level, due to extreme lengthening of systolic ejection time.<ref name=Teerlink2009/>  Thus due to the unique cardiac myosin activation mechanism, omecamtiv mecarbil could safely improve cardiac function within tolerated doses. Omecamtiv mecarbil effectively relieves symptoms and enhances the quality of life of systolic heart failure patients. It drastically improves cardiac performance in the short term; however, the hopeful long-term effects of reduced [[mortality rate|mortality]] have yet to be studied.<ref name=Teerlink2009/><ref name=DykeKoelling/>
