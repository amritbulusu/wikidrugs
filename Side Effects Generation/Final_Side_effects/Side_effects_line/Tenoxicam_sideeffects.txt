Common side effects that have been observed with tenoxicam include peptic ulceration, dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, headache, edema, renal failure, and vertigo.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">Tilcotil.

Taking tenoxicam with other drugs can increase the chance of side effects or alter the therapeutic effect of tenoxicam or the other drug, depending on the combination.  Drug types the tenoxicam may interact with include: other analgesic NSAIDs, [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]]<nowiki/>s such as aspirin, [[antacid]]s, anticoagulants, [[cardiac glycoside]]s, [[ciclosporin]], [[quinolone antibiotic]]s, [[Lithium (medication)|lithium therapy]], diuretics and anti-hypertensives, [[methotrexate]], oral anti-diabetics, [[Cholestyramine|colestyramine]], [[dextromethorphan]], [[mifepristone]], corticosteroids, anti-platelet agents and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), [[tacrolimus]], [[zidovudine]], and gold/[[penicillamine]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />

 
The first members of the oxicam family of NSAIDs were brought to market in France in 1982.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Toxic epidermal necrolysis after oxicam use.|last = Penso|first = D|date = 1986|journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|doi = 10.1016/s0190-9622(86)80342-5|pmid = 3485122|access-date =|volume=14|pages=275–6}}</ref>  Shortly thereafter, tenoxicam went to phase III clinical trials for approval as use as an analgesic began in the 1980s.  The general consensus from clinical studies is that tenoxicam has about equal analgesic effect as other NSAIDs and does not elicit any important side effects.  More recent clinical trials for tenoxicam are examining the use of tenoxicam independently and in combination with other drugs for more specialized analgesic purposes in surgical operations such as third molar extraction and labor pains.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Search of: tenoxicam - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov|url = https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=tenoxicam&Search=Search|website = www.clinicaltrials.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = A comparison of the effects of methylprednisolone and tenoxicam on pain, edema, and trismus after impacted lower third molar extraction.|last = Agacayak|first = Kamil Serkan|date = January 2014|journal = Medical Science Monitor|doi = 10.12659/MSM.890239|pmid = 24473372|pmc=3915002|volume=20|pages=147–52}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Long-term study with Ro 12-0068 (tenoxicam) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.|last = Mathias Filho|first = Annibal Pires|date = 1985|journal = European Journal of Rheumatology and Inflammation|doi = |pmid = 3915886|access-date =|volume=8|pages=3–8}}</ref>
