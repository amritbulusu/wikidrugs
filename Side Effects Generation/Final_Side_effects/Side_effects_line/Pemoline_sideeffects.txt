Pemoline is generally considered [[dopaminergic]], but its precise method of action hasn't yet been definitively determined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cylert (Pemoline)|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/016832s022_017703s018lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=December 2002}}</ref> Pemoline passes the [[bloodâ€“brain barrier]] and acts as a surrogate for dopamine, not affecting endogenous intracellular dopamine. For this reason, and the fact that it has little or no affinity for adrenaline receptors, pemoline has minimal [[sympathomimetic]] side effects such as: dry mouth, reduction in appetite, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac stress, dilated pupils and insomnia. There is some data to suggest that pemoline is a [[nootropic]] acting as a catalyst conductor in the synapses of the brain's memory centers, raising the efficiency of memory and assisting [[RNA]] formation in the brain. While drugs like [[dexamphetamine]] and [[methylphenidate]] are classified as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|Schedule II]], pemoline is listed as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV controlled substances|Schedule IV]] (non-narcotic). In studies conducted on primates, pemoline fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration.
