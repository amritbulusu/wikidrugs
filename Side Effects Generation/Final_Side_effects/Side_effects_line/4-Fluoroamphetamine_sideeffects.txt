'''4-Fluoroamphetamine''' ('''4-FA'''; '''4-FMP'''; '''PAL-303'''; "'''Flux'''"), also known as '''''para''-fluoroamphetamine''' ('''PFA''') is a [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[research chemical]] of the [[phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es. It produces [[stimulant]] and [[entactogen]]ic effects, and is described subjectively as being between amphetamine and MDMA. As a [[recreational drug]], 4-FA is sometimes sold along with related compounds such as [[2-fluoroamphetamine]] and [[4-fluoromethamphetamine]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rösner | first1 = P | last2 = Quednow | first2 = B | last3 = Girreser | first3 = U | last4 = Junge | first4 = T | title = Isomeric fluoro-methoxy-phenylalkylamines: a new series of controlled-substance analogues (designer drugs) | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 148 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 143–56 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15639609 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.05.003 }}</ref><ref name="Nagai 2007">{{cite journal | last1 = Nagai | first1 = F | last2 = Nonaka | first2 = R | last3 = Satoh Hisashi Kamimura | first3 = K | title = The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 559 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 132–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17223101 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075 }}</ref>

 
4-FA is popular in the Netherlands where it is predominantly used for its specific effects (77% of users) rather than its legal status (18%).<ref name="LinsenKoning2015"/>

 
===Effects===

 
The subjective effects of 4-fluoroamphetamine include [[euphoria]] which some find similar to the effects of [[MDMA]] and amphetamine,<ref name="LinsenKoning2015">{{cite journal|last1=Linsen|first1=Felix|last2=Koning|first2=Raoul P.

The general course of effects involves primarily empathogenic effects for the first few hours, which fades out as increased stimulation develops over the next several hours. {{medcn|date=August 2014}}

Common acute side effects are nausea, headaches, increased heart rate and insomnia.{{medcn|date=January 2013}}

 
4-FA does not cause long-lasting depletion of brain serotonin, unlike its [[structural analog|analogs]] [[para-Chloroamphetamine|4-CA]] and [[para-Bromoamphetamine|4-BA]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1978.tb31530.x| pmid = 81648| title = Neurotoxic Action of Halogenated Amphetamines| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| volume = 305| pages = 289–304| year = 1978| last1 = Harvey | first1 = J.
