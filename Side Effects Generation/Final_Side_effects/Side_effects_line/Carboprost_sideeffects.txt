This molecular feature is readily introduced at the stage of the Corey lactone ('''1''') by reaction with methyl [[Grignard reagent]] or [[trimethylaluminium]]. The resulting mixture of tertiary carbinols ('''2''') is transformed to oxytocic carboprost ('''3''') by standard transformations, including sepoaration of diastereomers, so that the final product is the C-15 analogue. This diastereomer is reputably freeer of porstaglandin side effects than the C-15 (S) isomer.
