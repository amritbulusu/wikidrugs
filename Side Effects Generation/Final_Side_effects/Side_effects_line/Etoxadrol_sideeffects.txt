'''Etoxadrol''' (CL-1848C) is a [[Dissociative drug|dissociative]] [[anaesthetic]] drug that has been found to be an [[NMDA antagonist]] and produce similar effects to [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] in animals.<ref name="cite DOI|10.1021/jm00120a004">{{Cite journal | last1 = Thurkauf | first1 = A. | last2 = Zenk | first2 = P.

Despite its [[anesthetic]] and [[analgesic]] effects, etoxadrol does not interact with [[Benzodiazepine receptor#Target for benzodiazepines|benzodiazepine]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic acetylcholine]], or [[mu Opioid receptor|mu opioid receptors]].<ref name=thurkauf />  However, etoxadrol may act in the [[dopamine]] [[mesolimbic pathway|reward pathway]], explaining its [[reinforcement|reinforcing properties]].<ref name="Brady 56–62"/>
