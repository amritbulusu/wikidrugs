'''Rogletimide''', also known as '''pyridoglutethimide''', is a drug related in chemical structure to the sedative [[glutethimide]], but instead having pharmacological activity as a selective [[aromatase inhibitor]] similar to the related drug [[aminoglutethimide]], but with no significant sedative effect.<ref name="pmid7949204">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanden Bossche HV, Moereels H, Koymans LM |title=Aromatase inhibitors--mechanisms for non-steroidal inhibitors |journal=Breast Cancer Research and Treatment |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=43–55 |year=1994 |pmid=7949204 |doi= 10.1007/bf00682740|url=}}</ref> This makes it potentially useful in the treatment of some forms of cancer, and with less side effects than aminoglutethimide, but its lower potency caused it to be unsuccessful in clinical trials.<ref name="pmid1419608">{{cite journal |vauthors=MacNeill FA, Jones AL, Jacobs S, Lønning PE, Powles TJ, Dowsett M |title=The influence of aminoglutethimide and its analogue rogletimide on peripheral aromatisation in breast cancer |journal=British Journal of Cancer |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=692–7 |date=October 1992 |pmid=1419608 |pmc=1977412 |doi= 10.1038/bjc.1992.339|url=}}</ref>
