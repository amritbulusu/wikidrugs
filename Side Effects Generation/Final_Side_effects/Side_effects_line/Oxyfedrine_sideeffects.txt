'''Oxyfedrine''' is a [[vasodilator]] and a [[Beta-adrenergic agonist|Î² adrenoreceptor agonist]]. It was found to depress the tonicity of coronary vessels, improve myocardial metabolism (so that heart can sustain hypoxia better) and also exert a positive chronotropic and inotropic effects, thereby not precipitating [[angina pectoris]]. The latter property (positive chronotropic and inotropic effects) is particularly important, because other vasodilators used in angina may be counter productive causing coronary steal phenomenon. 

 
Synergistic effects with [[antibiotic]]s have been suggested.<ref name="pmid15802815">{{cite journal
