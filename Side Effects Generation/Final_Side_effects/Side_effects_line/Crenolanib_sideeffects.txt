Crenolanib has been shown to have [[IC50]] and Kd values of 67 nM and 78 nM, respectively, for wild type [[c-KIT]] in in vitro assays{{citation needed|reason=This claim doesn't have a citation. Reference 14 does NOT have actual Kd... it just says "still being determined"|date=September 2014}}.  Similar assays show that crenolanib inhibits [[c-KIT]] activating mutations D816H and D816V with [[IC50]] concentrations of 5.4 and 2.5 nM, respectively.<ref name="Ref7" />{{citation needed|reason=This claim doesn't have a citation. Reference 14 does NOT have actual Kd... it just says "still being determined"|date=September 2014}}  Human [[bone marrow]] [[progenitor cell]] growth assays showed that crenolanib has modest effects on [[GM-CSF]] and [[BFUE]] driven colony formation at the [[IC50]] concentration of 20 nM.<ref name="Ref8" />
