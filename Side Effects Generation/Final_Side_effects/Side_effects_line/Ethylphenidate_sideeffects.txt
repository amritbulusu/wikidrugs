There have been anecdotal reports of a perforated septum resulting from even just a few uses of ethylphenidate by insufflation (snorting). Some users also report the drug is extremely painful to insufflate. This is almost certainly due to the ethylphenidate that is sourced from [[grey market]] vendors containing caustic impurities. There is absolutely no evidence that pure ethylphenidate would have caustic effects, since ethylphenidate only differs from methylphenidate in that MPH's [[methyl acetate]] is replaced with an [[ethyl acetate]] in EPH. Methyl acetate and ethyl acetate have exactly the same [[pKa]] of 25,<ref>https://owl.oit.umass.edu/departments/OrganicChemistry/appendix/pKaTable.html</ref><ref>https://www.proprofs.com/flashcards/story.php?title=pka-values_1</ref> which means that they are both even less acidic than water, which has a pKa of 14<ref>https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Fundamentals/What_is_the_pKa_of_water%3F</ref> (the lower the pKa the stronger the acid). Considering the fact that methylphenidate has been [[recreational drug use|recreationally]] insufflated by 4% of the general population<ref>{{cite journal| pmid=19630746 | volume=2 | issue=2 | title=Illicit methylphenidate use: a review of prevalence, availability, pharmacology, and consequences | year=2009 | journal=Curr Drug Abuse Rev | pages=157â€“76 | last1 = Bogle | first1 = KE | last2 = Smith | first2 = BH}}</ref> without any reports of perforated septums and since ethylphenidate is certainly not more [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] than methylphenidate, it is clear that the cause for the pain caused can ony be impurities.
