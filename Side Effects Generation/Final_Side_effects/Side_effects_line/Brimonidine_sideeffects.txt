Peripheral α<sub>2</sub> agonist activity results in vasoconstriction of blood vessels (as opposed to central α<sub>2</sub> agonist activity that decreases sympathetic tone, as can be seen by the medication [[clonidine]]). This vasoconstriction may explain the acute reduction in aqueous humor flow. The increased uveoscleral outflow from prolonged use may be explained by increased prostaglandin release due to α adrenergic stimulation. This may lead to relaxed ciliary muscle and increased uveoscleral outflow.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Toris | first1 = C. | last2 = Camras | first2 = C. | last3 = Yablonski | first3 = M. | title = Acute versus chronic effects of brimonidine on aqueous humor dynamics in ocular hypertensive patients | journal = American journal of ophthalmology | volume = 128 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–14 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10482088 | doi=10.1016/s0002-9394(99)00076-8}}</ref>
