'''Benzonatate''', marketed under the trade names '''Tessalon''' and '''Tessalon Perles''' among others, is a non-[[narcotic]] oral cough suppressant, or ''[[antitussive]]'', with effects that last from 6 to 8 hours. Since it is not an opioid, benzonatate is not as prone to abuse like some other cough medications such as [[codeine]]. Benzonatate was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1958.<ref name=MedicineNet>MedicineNet.com: [http://www.medicinenet.com/benzonatate/article.htm Benzonatate]</ref>
