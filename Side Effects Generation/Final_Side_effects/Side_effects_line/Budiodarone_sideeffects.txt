'''Budiodarone''' ('''ATI-2042''') is an [[antiarrhythmic agent]] and chemical analog of [[amiodarone]] that is currently being studied in [[clinical trials]]. Amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available,<ref>Roy, D. et al. Amiodarone to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med. 2000;342:913-920</ref><ref>Singh, B.N., et al. Amiodarone versus sotalol for atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med. 2005;352:1861-1872</ref><ref>Kochiadakis, G.E., et al. Low dose amiodarone and sotalol in the treatment of recurrent, symptomatic atrial fibrillation: a comparative, placebo controlled study. Heart. 2000;84:251-257</ref> but its adverse side effects, including hepatic, pulmonary and thyroid toxicity as well as multiple drug interactions,<ref name="Morey">Morey, T.E. et al. Structure-activity relationships and electrophysiological effects of short-acting amiodarone homologs in guinea pig isolated heart. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2001;297:260-266</ref> are discouraging its use. Budiodarone only differs in structure from amiodarone through the presence of a [[sec-Butyl acetate|''sec''-butyl acetate]] side chain at position 2 of the [[benzofuran]] moiety.<ref>Mason, P.K., DiMarco, P. Advances in Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology. Circulation. 2009;2:588-597</ref> This side chain allows for budiodarone to have a shorter [[half-life]] in the body than amiodarone (7 hours versus 35–68 days) which allows it to have a faster onset of action and metabolism while still maintaining similar electrophysiological activity.<ref name="Morey" /> The faster metabolism of budiodarone allows for fewer adverse side effects than amiodarone principally due to decreased levels of toxicity in the body.

 
Preliminary trials of budiodarone have administered the drug orally as a tartrate salt in amounts ranging from 200–800&nbsp;mg bid.<ref name="Arya">Arya, A. et al.

Presented at Heart Rhythm Society Annual Scientific Sessions, Boston, Massachusetts, May 2009</ref> Evidence has shown that 400–600&nbsp;mg [[bis in die|bid]] doses were associated with the highest reduction in atrial fibrillation burden (54.4% and 75% respectively)<ref name="Ezekowitz" /> while remaining free of the adverse side effects common with amiodarone.<ref name="Arya" />

 
Data on the effects of long-term budiodarone are not yet available. The completion of current clinical trials will examine chronic budiodarone use to confirm or deny its use as an effective and safe antiarrhythmic drug.
