Diltiazem has negative [[inotropic]], [[chronotropic]], and [[dromotropic]] effects. This means diltiazem causes a decrease in [[heart muscle contractility]] – how strong the beat is, lowering of heart rate – due to slowing of the [[sinoatrial node]], and a slowing of conduction through the [[atrioventricular node]] – increasing the time needed for each beat. Each of these effects results in reduced [[oxygen consumption]] by the heart, reducing angina symptoms. These effects also reduce blood pressure by causing less blood to be pumped out.

 
==Nontherapeutic effects and toxicities==

 
A reflex sympathetic response, caused by the [[peripheral dilation]] of vessels and the resulting drop in blood pressure, works to counteract the negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects of diltiazem. Undesirable effects include [[hypotension]], [[bradycardia]], [[dizziness]], and [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=196–200 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(05)80202-1 |title=A one-year evaluation of calcium channel blocker overdoses: Toxicity and treatment |year=1993 |last1=Ramoska |first1=E |last2=Spiller |first2=H |last3=Winter |first3=M |last4=Borys |first4=D |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=22 |issue=2 |pmid=8427431}}</ref>

 
* [[Variant angina]] – it is effective owing to its direct effects on [[coronary dilation]].

 
Because of its [[vasodilatory]] effects, diltiazem is useful for treating [[hypertension]]. Calcium channel blockers are well tolerated, and especially effective in treating low-[[renin]] hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=621–29; quiz 630–1 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-6175.2004.03683.x |title=The Role of Existing and Newer Calcium Channel Blockers in the Treatment of Hypertension |year=2004 |last1=Basile |first1=Jan |journal=The Journal of Clinical Hypertension |volume=6 |issue=11}}</ref>

 
* In [[congestive heart failure]], patients with reduced ventricular function may not be able to counteract the inotropic and chronotropic effects of diltiazem, the result being an even higher compromise of function.

 
* With [[Heart block|SA node or AV conduction disturbances]], the use of diltiazem should be avoided in patients with SA or AV nodal abnormalities, because of its negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects.

 
[[Quinidine]] should not be used concurrently with calcium channel blockers because of reduced clearance of both drugs and potential [[pharmacodynamic]] effects at the SA and AV nodes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Narimatsu|first=Akihiro|author2=Norio Taira|title=Effects on Atrio-Ventricular Conduction of Calcium-Antagonistic Coronary Vasodilators, Local Anaesthetics and Quinidine Injected into the Posterior and the Anterior Septal Artery of the Atrio-Ventricular Node Preparation of the Dog|journal=Archives of Pharmacology|date=August 1976|volume=294|issue=2|pages=169–77|doi=10.1007/bf00507850}}</ref>
