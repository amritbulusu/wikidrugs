The drug was shown to competitively inhibit binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, inhibiting the 5-HT driven release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

 
Lomerizine has also been shown to possess neuroprotective effects, specifically in the case of retinal damage.  Doses of .03&nbsp;mg/kg given intravenously as a pretreatment were shown to prevent [[glutamate-induced neurotoxicity]], while also providing protection against [[NMDA]]-induced and [[kainate]]-induced neurotoxicity. Lomerizine was shown to have little affinity for NMDA or kainate receptors, so its protectivity against neurotoxicity in these cases is believed to be due to the blocking of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels.<ref name=Hara2004>{{cite journal|last1=Hara|first1=H|last2=Toriu|first2=N|last3=Shimazawa|first3=M|title=Clinical potential of lomerizine, a Ca2+ channel blocker as an anti-glaucoma drug: effects on ocular circulation and retinal neuronal damage.|journal=Cardiovascular drug reviews|date=2004|volume=22|issue=3|pages=199–214|pmid=15492768|doi=10.1111/j.1527-3466.2004.tb00141.x}}</ref>  By blocking these channels and preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, lomerizine increases circulation in the [[optic disc|optic nerve head]]. These effects show that lomerizine may prove to be a useful treatment for ischemic retinal diseases, such as glaucoma.<ref name=Hara2004 />

 
Lomerizine also shows neuroprotective effects against secondary degeneration resulting from injury in [[retinal ganglion cells]].  In this case, increased membrane depolarization, in conjunction with the inability of the [[sodium-calcium exchanger]] to function due to depleted ATP stores, causes the activation of calcium-dependent signal transduction.  These processes lead to cell death through either apoptosis or necrosis.<ref name=Fitzgerald2009 />  Lomerizine's role in blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> can rescue these cells from death by preventing excitotoxicity.  Decreased intracellular calcium also prevents necrosis by decreasing permeability, and apoptotic death is reduced through the reduction of calcium-dependent apoptotic agents.<ref name=Fitzgerald2009 />

 
While some calcium-channel blockers, such as [[flunarizine]], act on the dopaminergic system, lomerizine is ineffective ''in vivo'' at inhibiting the release of dopamine.  However, it has been observed to weakly inhibit the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone to D2 [[dopamine receptors]] ''in vitro''.<ref name=ikegami1992>{{cite journal|last1=Ikegami|first1=A|last2=Ozaki|first2=A|last3=Hara|first3=H|last4=Sukamoto|first4=T|last5=Yamashita|first5=A|last6=Ito|first6=K|title=Neurochemical investigation on the effects of a new diphenylpiperazine calcium antagonist, KB-2796, on the central dopaminergic system of rats.|journal=Japanese journal of pharmacology|date=April 1992|volume=58|issue=4|pages=399–405|pmid=1405037|doi=10.1254/jjp.58.399}}</ref>  While researchers are unsure of the reason for this difference, one hypothesis is that the doses administered cannot reach a high enough concentration in the brain to affect [[D2 receptors]].<ref name=ikegami1992 />

 
Lomerizine is typically taken orally in a dose of 2 to 10&nbsp;mg two to three times a day,<ref name=Hara2004 /> but doses of 20&nbsp;mg are not uncommon.<ref name=imai2007>{{cite journal|last1=Imai|first1=Noboru|last2=Konishi|first2=Takashi|last3=Serizawa|first3=Masahiro|last4=Okabe|first4=Takashi|title=Do the Effects of Long-term Lomerizine Administration Differ with Age?|journal=Internal Medicine|date=2007|volume=46|issue=10|pages=683–684|doi=10.2169/internalmedicine.46.6409}}</ref>  It is also available in an intravenous solution of lomerizine hydrochloride, but the preferred route of administration, especially for treatment of the optic nerve, is oral.<ref name=Hara2002 />

 
Lomerizine may cause drowsiness and flushing, but it lacks the serious cardiovascular effects and hypotension produced by other calcium antagonists.  This is hypothesized to be due to the drug's selectivity for cerebral arteries<ref name=Tamaki2003 /> over peripheral arteries.  No other side effects have been reported.
