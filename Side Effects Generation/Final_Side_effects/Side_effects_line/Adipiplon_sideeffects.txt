'''Adipiplon''' ('''NG2-73''') is an [[anxiolytic]] drug developed by [[Neurogen Corporation]]. It has similar effects to [[benzodiazepine]] drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a [[nonbenzodiazepine]] anxiolytic. 

 
Adipiplon is being researched as a potential medication for the treatment of [[anxiety]] and [[insomnia]], and in 2008 it was being used in Phase IIb trials.<ref> [http://www.neurogen.com/products/gaba%20insomnia.html Pipeline Summary GABA: Adipiplon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411105736/http://www.neurogen.com/products/gaba%20insomnia.html |date=April 11, 2008 }}</ref><ref> [http://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/neurogen-announces-adipiplon-preclinical-clinical-data-presented-neuroscience-2007-2614.html Neurogen Announces Adipiplon Preclinical and Clinical Data]</ref><ref> [http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/sleep_report/2007-09-12_07.asp Meet Adipiplon: The New Insomnia Drug] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415004751/http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/sleep_report/2007-09-12_07.asp |date=April 15, 2008 }}</ref> These trials were suspended after significant next-day side effects were discovered.<ref>[http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/neurogen-announces-suspension-of-insomnia-study-adipiplon Neurogen Announces Suspension of Insomnia Study with Adipiplon]</ref>
