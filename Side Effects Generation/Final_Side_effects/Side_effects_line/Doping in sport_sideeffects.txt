Over the last 20 years the appearance of steroids in sports has been seen as an epidemic. Research and limited tests have been conducted only to find short-term, reversible effects on athletes that are both physical and mental. These side effects would be alleviated if athletes would be allowed the use of  controlled substances under proper medical supervision. These side-effects include Intramuscular abscesses and other microbial bacteria that can cause infections, from counterfeited products the user decides to purchase on the black market, high blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as infertility, and dermatological conditions like severe acne. Mental effects include increased aggression, depression, and in rare cases suicide has been seen as well. Most studies on the effects of steroids have shown to be improper and lacking credible tests as well as performing studies in a skewed fashion to predetermine the world’s view on the use of steroids in sports. Long-term effects have not been able to be pinpointed just yet due to the recency of testing these substances but would start show up as early steroid users reach the age of 50 and older.

 
[[Benzedrine]] is a trade name for amphetamine. The Council of Europe says it first appeared in sport at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.<ref>''Doping of athletes, a European survey'', Council of Europe, France, 1964</ref> It was produced in 1887 and the derivative, Benzedrine, was isolated in the U.S. in 1934 by [[Gordon Alles]]. Its perceived effects gave it the street name "speed". British troops used 72&nbsp;million amphetamine tablets in the Second World War<ref name=DeMon/>  and the RAF got through so many that "Methedrine won the Battle of Britain" according to one report.<ref>Grant, D.N.W.; ''Air Force, UK, 1944</ref> The problem was that amphetamine leads to a lack of judgement and a willingness to take risks, which in sport could lead to better performances but in fighters and bombers led to more crash landings than the RAF could tolerate. The drug was withdrawn but large stocks remained on the black market. Amphetamine was also used legally as an aid to slimming and also as a [[thymoleptic]] before being phased out by the appearance of newer agents in the 1950s.

 
One approach of athletes to get around regulations on stimulants is to use new designer stimulants, which have not previously been officially prohibited, but have similar chemical structures or biological effects.  Designer stimulants that attracted media attention in 2010 included mephendrone, ephendrome, and fluoroamphetamines; which have chemical structures and effects similar to ephedrine and amphetamine.

 
Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were first isolated, identified and [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in [[medicine]] to induce [[bone]] growth, stimulate [[appetite]], induce male [[puberty]], and treat chronic [[wasting]] conditions, such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]]. Anabolic steroids also increase muscle mass and physical strength, and are therefore used in [[sports]] and [[bodybuilding]] to enhance strength or physique. Known side effects include harmful changes in [[cholesterol]] levels (increased [[Low density lipoprotein]] and decreased [[High density lipoprotein]]), [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[high blood pressure]], and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]. Some of these effects can be mitigated by taking supplemental drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse: A looming public health concern? |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=98 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–12 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18599224 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004 |url= |pmc=2646607}}</ref>

 
AAS use in sports began in October 1954 when [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]], a doctor who treated American athletes, went to [[Vienna]] with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian physician who, over "a few drinks", repeatedly asked "What are you giving your boys?"  When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone. Returning to America, Ziegler tried low doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on two lifters, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce but there were side-effects.<ref>Laure, P.: Les répresentations du dopage; approche psycho-sociologique, Thèse STAPS, Nancy, France, 1994</ref> Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, [[methandrostenolone]], (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the US in 1958 by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yesalis CE, Anderson WA, Buckley WE, Wright JE |title=Incidence of the nonmedical use of anabolic-androgenic steroids |journal=NIDA research monograph |volume=102 |issue= |pages=97–112 |year=1990 |pmid=2079979 |doi= |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/102.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Fair JD |title=Isometrics or Steroids?

Olympic statistics show the weight of shot putters increased 14 percent between 1956 and 1972, whereas steeplechasers weight increased 7.6 per cent. The gold medalist pentathlete [[Mary Peters (athlete)|Mary Peters]] said: "A medical research team in the United States attempted to set up extensive research into the effects of steroids on weightlifters and throwers, only to discover that there were so few who weren't taking them that they couldn't establish any worthwhile comparisons."<ref>Peters, Mary: Mary P, Arrow Books, UK, 1976</ref> In 1984, [[Jay Silvester]], a former four-time Olympian and 1972 silver medalist in the discus, who was then with the physical education department of Brigham Young University in the U.S., questioned competitors at that year's Olympics.<ref>{{Cite web|title = USATF – Hall of Fame|url = http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=154|website = www.usatf.org|accessdate = 17 July 2015}}</ref> The range of steroid use he found ranged from 10&nbsp;mg a day to 100&nbsp;mg.

:Dr (Heinz) Wuschech knows more about anabolic steroids than any doctor I have ever met, and yet he cannot discuss them openly any more than Geoff Capes or Mac Wilkins can openly discuss them in the current climate of amateur sports regulation. What I did learn in East Germany was that they feel there is little danger from anabolica, as they call it, when the athletes are kept on strictly monitored programmes. Although the extremely dangerous side-effects are admitted, they are statistically no more likely to occur than side-effects from the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. If, that is, programmes are constantly medically monitored as to dosage.<ref>Cited Woodland, Les: Dope, the use of drugs in sport, David and Charles, UK, 1980</ref>

 
In sports where physical strength is favored, athletes have used [[anabolic steroid]]s, known for their ability to increase physical strength and muscle mass.<ref name="Michael Powers 2005, p. 330">Michael Powers, "Performance-Enhancing Drugs" in Joel Houglum, in Gary L. Harrelson, Deidre Leaver-Dunn, "Principles of Pharmacology for Athletic Trainers", SLACK Incorporated, 2005, {{ISBN|1-55642-594-5}}, p. 330</ref> The drug mimics the effect of [[testosterone]] and dihydrotestosterone in the body.<ref name="Michael Powers 2005, p. 330"/> They were developed after Eastern Bloc countries demonstrated success in weightlifting during the 1940s.<ref name="Michael Powers 2005, p. 330"/> At the time they were using testosterone, which carried with it negative effects, anabolic steroids were developed as a solution. The drug has been used across a wide range of sports from football and basketball to weightlifting and track and field. While not as life-threatening as the drugs used in endurance sports, anabolic steroids have negative side effects, including:

 
===Side effects in men===

 
===Side effects in women===

 
Side effects in women include:<ref>{{Cite web|title = Anabolic steroid misuse – NHS Choices|url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/anabolic-steroid-abuse/Pages/Introduction.aspx|website = www.nhs.uk|accessdate = 17 July 2015}}</ref>

 
Some commentators maintain that, as outright prevention of doping is an impossibility, all doping should be legalised. However, most disagree with this, pointing out the claimed harmful long-term effects of many doping agents. Opponents claim that with doping legal, all competitive athletes would be compelled to use drugs, and the net effect would be a level playing field but with widespread health consequences. Considering that anti-doping is largely ineffective due to both testing limitations and lack of enforcement, this is not markedly different from the situation already in existence.
