'''Panadiplon''' ('''U-78875''') is an [[anxiolytic]] drug with a novel [[chemical structure]] that is not closely related to other drugs of this type. It has a similar pharmacological profile to the [[benzodiazepine]] family of drugs, but with mainly anxiolytic properties and relatively little [[sedative]] or [[amnestic]] effect, and so is classified as a [[nonbenzodiazepine]] anxiolytic.<ref>Tang AH, Franklin SR, Himes CS, Ho PM.
