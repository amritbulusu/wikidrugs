In the brain, norepinephrine is produced in nuclei that are small yet exert powerful effects on other brain areas. The most important of these nuclei is the [[locus coeruleus]], located in the [[pons]]. Outside the brain, norepinephrine is used as a neurotransmitter by [[sympathetic ganglion|sympathetic ganglia]] located near the [[spinal cord]] or in the [[abdomen]], and it is also released directly into the bloodstream by the [[adrenal gland]]s. Regardless of how and where it is released, norepinephrine acts on target cells by binding to and activating [[noradrenergic receptor]]s located on the cell surface.

 
A variety of medically important drugs work by altering the actions of norepinephrine systems.  [[Norepinephrine (drug)|Norepinephrine]] itself is widely used as an injectable drug for the treatment of critically low blood pressure.  [[Beta blocker]]s, which counter some of the effects of norepinephrine, are frequently used to treat [[glaucoma]], [[migraine]], and a range of cardiovascular problems.  [[Alpha blocker]]s, which counter a different set of norepinephrine effects, are used to treat several cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions.  [[Alpha-adrenergic receptor|Alpha-2 agonists]] often have a sedating effect, and are commonly used as anesthesia-enhancers in surgery, as well as in treatment of drug or alcohol dependence. Many important psychiatric drugs exert strong effects on norepinephrine systems in the brain, resulting in side-effects that may be helpful or harmful.

 
=== Cellular effects ===

 
Like many other biologically active substances, norepinephrine exerts its effects by binding to and activating [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] located on the surface of cells. Two broad families of norepinephrine receptors have been identified, known as alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>  Alpha receptors are divided into subtypes [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]]; beta receptors into subtypes [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>2</sub>]], and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>3</sub>]].<ref name=Rang&Dale/> All of these function as [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex [[second messenger system]].<ref name=Rang&Dale/> Alpha-2 receptors usually have inhibitory effects, but many are located pre-synaptically (i.e., on the surface of the cells that release norepinephrine), so the net effect of alpha-2 activation is often a decrease in the amount of norepinephrine released.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>  Alpha-1 receptors and all three types of beta receptors usually have excitatory effects.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>

 
Broadly speaking, the effect of norepinephrine on each target organ is to modify its state in a way that makes it more conducive to active body movement, often at a cost of increased energy use and increased wear and tear.<ref name=Schacter>{{cite book|title=Psychology: European Edition |authors=Schacter D, Gilbert D, Wegner D, Hood B |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-230-34367-2 |page=93}}</ref>  This can be contrasted with the [[acetylcholine]]-mediated effects of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], which modifies most of the same organs into a state more conducive to rest, recovery, and digestion of food, and usually less costly in terms of energy expenditure.<ref name=Schacter/>

 
The sympathetic effects of norepinephrine include:

 
* In the heart, an increase in the amount of blood pumped.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tank AW, Lee Wong D | title = Peripheral and central effects of circulating catecholamines | journal = Comprehensive Physiology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25589262 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c140007 }}</ref>

 
* Multiple effects on the [[immune system]].  The sympathetic nervous system is the primary path of interaction between the immune system and the brain, and several components receive sympathetic inputs, including the [[thymus]], [[spleen]], and [[lymph node]]s.  However the effects are complex, with some immune processes activated while others are inhibited.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kenney MJ, Ganta CK | title = Autonomic nervous system and immune system interactions | journal = Comprehensive Physiology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 1177–200 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24944034 | pmc = 4374437 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c130051 }}</ref>

 
The noradrenergic neurons in the brain form a [[neurotransmitter system]], that, when activated, exerts effects on large areas of the brain. The effects are manifested in alertness, [[arousal]], and readiness for action.

 
[[Noradrenergic]] neurons (i.e., neurons whose primary neurotransmitter is norepinephrine) are comparatively few in number, and their cell bodies are confined to a few relatively small brain areas, but they send projections to many other brain areas and exert powerful effects on their targets.  These [[noradrenergic cell groups]] were first mapped in 1964 by Annica Dahlström and Kjell Fuxe, who assigned them labels starting with the letter "A" (for "aminergic").<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahlstroem A, Fuxe K | title = Evidence for the existence of monoamine-containing neurons in the central nervous system.

A large number of important drugs exert their effects by interacting with norepinephrine systems in the brain or body.  Their uses include treatment of cardiovascular problems, shock, and a variety of psychiatric conditions.

 
[[Sympathomimetic drug]]s mimic or enhance at least some of the effects of norepinephrine released by the sympathetic nervous system; [[sympatholytic]] drugs, in contrast, block at least some of the effects.<ref name=Gardenhire>{{cite book |title=Rau's Respiratory Care Pharmacology |author=Gardenhire DS |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-323-27714-3 |page=88}}</ref>  Both of these are large groups with diverse uses, depending on exactly which effects are enhanced or blocked.<ref name=Gardenhire/>  [[Norepinephrine (medication)|Norepinephrine]] itself is classified as a sympathomimetic drug:  its effects when given by intravenous injection of increasing heart rate and force and constricting blood vessels make it very useful for treating medical emergencies that involve critically low blood pressure.<ref name=Gardenhire/>

 
These are drugs that block the effects of beta noradrenergic receptors while having little or no effect on alpha receptors.

Selective [[alpha-1 blocker]]s have a variety of uses.
