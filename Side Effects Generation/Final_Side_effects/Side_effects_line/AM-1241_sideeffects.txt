==Effects in bone cancer model==

 
The antihyperalgesic effects of AM-1241 were investigated in a [[murine]] bone cancer model. [[Sarcoma]] cells were injected into the femur of a mouse, and then mice were injected twice daily with AM-1241. Treatment with AM-1241 reduced both spontaneous and evoked pain, as well as reducing the bone loss and subsequent fractures due to the tumor. Pretreatment with the CB<sub>2</sub> antagonist [[SR-144,528]] reversed the acute effects of AM-1241 on both spontaneous and evoked pain, while having no effect on its own.<ref name=Lozano>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=Alysia|title=A cannabinoid 2 receptor agonist attenuates bone cancer-induced pain and bone loss|journal=Life Sciences|date=April 2010|pages=646–53|pmid=20176037|doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2010.02.014|volume=86|issue=17-18|pmc=2871326}}<!--|accessdate=18 December 2011--></ref>
