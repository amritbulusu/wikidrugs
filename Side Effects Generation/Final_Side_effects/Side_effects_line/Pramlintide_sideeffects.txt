In synergy with endogenous amylin, pramlintide aids in the regulation of blood [[glucose]] by slowing [[Stomach|gastric emptying]], promoting [[satiety]] via [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] receptors (different receptors than for [[Glucagon-like peptide 1|GLP-1]]), and inhibiting inappropriate secretion of [[glucagon]], a catabolic hormone that opposes the effects of insulin and amylin. Pramlintide also has effects in raising the acute first-phase insulin response threshold following a meal.
