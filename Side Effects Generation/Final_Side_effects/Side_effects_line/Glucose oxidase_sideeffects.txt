Glucose oxidase is widely used for the determination of free glucose in body fluids ([[diagnostic]]s), in vegetal raw material, and in the food industry. It also has many applications in [[biotechnology|biotechnologies]], typically enzyme assays for [[biochemistry]] including [[biosensors]] in [[nanotechnologies]].<ref name=GOxTechData>{{cite web | url = http://www.interchim.fr/ft/1/12718A.pdf | title = Glucose Oxidase Technical sheet | publisher = [[Interchim]] }}</ref><ref name="ghoshdastider">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghoshdastider U, Xu R, Trzaskowski B, Mlynarczyk K, Miszta P, Viswanathan S, Renugopalakrishnan V, Filipek S |  year = 2015 | title = Molecular Effects of Encapsulation of Glucose Oxidase Dimer by Graphene | journal = RSC Advances | volume = 5 | pages = 13570–8 | doi = 10.1039/C4RA16852F }}</ref> It was first isolated by [[Detlev_Müller|Detlev Müller]] in 1928 from ''[[Aspergillus niger]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Detlev Müller discovers glucose oxidase|url=https://tacomed.com/chapter-x-modern-glucose-measuring/detlev-muller-discovers-glucose-oxidase/|website=Tacomed.com|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>.

 
In manufacturing, GOx is used as an additive thanks to its oxidizing effects: it prompts for stronger dough in [[bakery]], replacing oxidants such as bromate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} It also helps remove oxygen from food packaging, or D-glucose from egg white to prevent browning.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
