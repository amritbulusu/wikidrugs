Halofuginone is also an inhibitor of [[collagen type I]] gene expression and as a consequence it may inhibit tumor cell growth.<ref name=drugdictionary/>  Halofuginone exerts its effects by acting as a high affinity inhibitor of the enzyme glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase. Inhibition of prolyl tRNA charging leads to the accumulation of uncharged prolyl tRNAs, which serve as a signal to initiate the amino acid starvation response, which in turn exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.790| pmid = 22327401| title = Halofuginone and other febrifugine derivatives inhibit prolyl-tRNA synthetase| journal = Nature Chemical Biology| volume = 8| issue = 3| pages = 311| year = 2012| last1 = Keller| first1 = Tracy L| last2 = Zocco| first2 = Davide| last3 = Sundrud| first3 = Mark S| last4 = Hendrick| first4 = Margaret| last5 = Edenius| first5 = Maja| last6 = Yum| first6 = Jinah| last7 = Kim| first7 = Yeon-Jin| last8 = Lee| first8 = Hak-Kyo| last9 = Cortese| first9 = Joseph F| last10 = Wirth| first10 = Dyann F| last11 = Dignam| first11 = John David| last12 = Rao| first12 = Anjana| last13 = Yeo| first13 = Chang-Yeol| last14 = Mazitschek| first14 = Ralph| last15 = Whitman| first15 = Malcolm}}</ref>
