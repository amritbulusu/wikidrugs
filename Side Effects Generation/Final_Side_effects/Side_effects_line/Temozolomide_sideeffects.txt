==Side-effects==

 
The most common side effect is [[bone marrow suppression]]. The most common non-hematological adverse effects associated with temozolomide are nausea and vomiting, which are either self-limiting or readily controlled with standard [[antiemetic]] therapy. These latter effects are usually mild to moderate (grade 1 to 2). The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting is around 4% each. Patients who have pre-existing or a history of severe vomiting may require antiemetic therapy before initiating temozolomide treatment. Temozolomide should be administered in the fasting state, at least one hour before a meal. Antiemetic therapy may be administered before, or following, administration of temozolomide. Temozolomide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to its components or to [[dacarbazine]]. The use of temozolomide is not recommended in patients with severe [[myelosuppression]].

 
In male patients, temozolomide can have genotoxic effects. Men are advised not to father a child during or up to six months after treatment and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to temozolomide therapy.

 
The therapeutic benefit of temozolomide depends on its ability to [[alkylate]]/[[methylate]] DNA, which most often occurs at the N-7 or O-6 positions of [[guanine]] residues. This methylation damages the DNA and triggers the death of tumor cells. However, some tumor cells are able to repair this type of DNA damage, and therefore diminish the therapeutic efficacy of temozolomide, by expressing a protein ''O''<sup>6</sup>-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) encoded in humans by the [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|''O''-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase]] (''MGMT'') gene.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacinto FV, Esteller M | title = MGMT hypermethylation: a prognostic foe, a predictive friend | journal = DNA Repair | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 1155–60 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17482895 | doi = 10.1016/j.dnarep.2007.03.013 }}</ref> In some tumors, [[epigenetic]] silencing of the ''MGMT'' gene prevents the synthesis of this enzyme, and as a consequence such tumors are more sensitive to killing by temozolomide.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hegi ME, Diserens AC, Gorlia T, Hamou MF, de Tribolet N, Weller M, Kros JM, Hainfellner JA, Mason W, Mariani L, Bromberg JE, Hau P, Mirimanoff RO, Cairncross JG, Janzer RC, Stupp R | title = MGMT gene silencing and benefit from temozolomide in glioblastoma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 10 | pages = 997–1003 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15758010 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa043331 }}</ref> Conversely, the presence of AGT protein in brain tumors predicts poor response to temozolomide and these patients receive little benefit from chemotherapy with temozolomide.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stupp R, Hegi ME, Mason WP, van den Bent MJ, Taphoorn MJ, Janzer RC, Ludwin SK, Allgeier A, Fisher B, Belanger K, Hau P, Brandes AA, Gijtenbeek J, Marosi C, Vecht CJ, Mokhtari K, Wesseling P, Villa S, Eisenhauer E, Gorlia T, Weller M, Lacombe D, Cairncross JG, Mirimanoff RO, ((European Organisation for Research Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumour Radiation Oncology Groups)), ((National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group))) | title = Effects of radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiotherapy alone on survival in glioblastoma in a randomised phase III study: 5-year analysis of the EORTC-NCIC trial | journal = The Lancet.

Because tumor cells that express the [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]] gene are more resistant to the effects of temozolomide, researchers investigated whether the inclusion of [[O6-benzylguanine|''O''<sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine]] (''O''<sup>6</sup>-BG), an AGT inhibitor, could overcome this resistance and improve the drug's therapeutic effectiveness. In the laboratory, this combination indeed showed increased temozolomide activity in tumor-cell culture [[in vitro]] and in animal models [[in vivo]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueno T, Ko SH, Grubbs E, Yoshimoto Y, Augustine C, Abdel-Wahab Z, Cheng TY, Abdel-Wahab OI, Pruitt SK, Friedman HS, Tyler DS | title = Modulation of chemotherapy resistance in regional therapy: a novel therapeutic approach to advanced extremity melanoma using intra-arterial temozolomide in combination with systemic O6-benzylguanine | journal = Molecular Cancer Therapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 732–8 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16546988 | doi = 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0098 | url = http://mct.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16546988 }}</ref> However, a recently{{Clarify timeframe}} completed phase-II clinical trial with brain-tumor patients yielded mixed outcomes; while there was some improved therapeutic activity when ''O''<sup>6</sup>-BG and temozolomide were given to patients with temozolomide-resistant [[anaplastic]] glioma, there seemed to be no significant restoration of temozolomide sensitivity in patients with temozolomide-resistant [[glioblastoma multiforme]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Quinn JA, Jiang SX, Reardon DA, Desjardins A, Vredenburgh JJ, Rich JN, Gururangan S, Friedman AH, Bigner DD, Sampson JH, McLendon RE, Herndon JE, Walker A, Friedman HS | title = Phase II trial of temozolomide plus o6-benzylguanine in adults with recurrent, temozolomide-resistant malignant glioma | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 1262–7 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19204199 | pmc = 2667825 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.8417 }}</ref>
