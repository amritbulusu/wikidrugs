== Adverse effects ==

 
Common side effects:

 
* 85% of patients report pain or other reaction at the infusion site. Other side effects may include [[headache]], diarrhea, nausea, rash, jaw pain, [[vasodilator|vasodilatation]], [[dizziness]], [[edema]] (swelling), [[pruritus]] (itching), and [[hypotension]].

 
The major effects of treprostinil are [[vasodilation]] of arteries in the lungs and body.  Treprostinil also inhibits [[platelet]] aggregation and smooth muscle proliferation.

 
The infusion rate is normally initiated at 1.25&nbsp;ng/kg/min for new patients, but may be reduced to 0.625&nbsp;ng/kg/min if the normal rate provokes unwanted side effects in the patient. The infusion rate of treprostinil should be increased no more than 1.25&nbsp;ng/kg/min per week for the first month, then 2.5&nbsp;ng/kg/min per week for the remaining duration of infusion. The infusion rate should ideally be high enough to improve symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, while minimizing unpleasant side effects (headache, nausea, emesis, restlessness, anxiety and infusion site pain or reaction). Dosage adjustments may be undertaken more often if tolerated. There is little experience with doses >40&nbsp;ng/kg/min. Abrupt cessation of infusion should be avoided. Restarting a Remodulin infusion within a few hours after an interruption can be done using the same dose rate. Interruptions for longer periods may require the dose of Remodulin to be re-titrated.
