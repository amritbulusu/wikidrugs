'''Astemizole''' (marketed under the brand name '''Hismanal''', developmental code R43512) was a second-generation [[antihistamine]] drug that has a long duration of action. Astemizole was discovered by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1977. It has been withdrawn from the market in most countries because of rare but potentially fatal side effects ([[QTc]] interval prolongation and related [[arrhythmias]] due to [[hERG]] channel blockade).<ref name="pmid10376921">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhou Z, Vorperian VR, Gong Q, Zhang S, January CT | title = Block of HERG potassium channels by the antihistamine astemizole and its metabolites desmethylastemizole and norastemizole | journal = J.

Astemizole is a histamine [[H1-receptor antagonist]]. It has [[anticholinergic]] and [[antipruritic]] effects.

 
Astemizole may also act on [[Histamine H3 receptor|histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor]]s, thereby producing adverse effects.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
