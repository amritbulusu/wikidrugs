'''Fipexide''' ('''Attentil''', '''Vigilor''') is a [[psychoactive drug]] of the [[piperazine]] [[chemical class]] which was developed in [[Italy]] in 1983.<ref>Missale C, Pasinetti G, Govoni S, Spano PF, Trabucchi M. Fipexide: a new drug for the regulation of dopaminergic system at the macromolecular level. Bollettino Chimico Farmaceutico. 1983 Feb;122(2):79-85.</ref> It was used as a [[nootropic]] drug in Italy and [[France]], mainly for the treatment of senile dementia,<ref>Bompani R, Scali G. Fipexide, an effective cognition activator in the elderly: a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Current Medical Research and Opinion. 1986;10(2):99-106.</ref> but is no longer in common use due to the occurrence of rare adverse drug reactions including [[fever]]<ref>Guy C, Blay N, Rousset H, Fardeau V, Ollagnier M.

Fipexide is similar in action to other nootropic drugs such as [[piracetam]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} and bares a few similarities in chemical structure to [[centrophenoxine]]. Chemically, it is an amide union of [[parachlorophenoxyacetate]] and [[methylenedioxybenzylpiperazine]] (MDBZP), and has been shown to metabolize to the latter, which plays a significant role in its effects{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.
