IRS-1’s main function is to act as a signal transmitter for intracellular pathways.<ref>THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY Vol. 278, No. 34, Issue of August 22, pp. 31964–31971, 2003 THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY</ref> IRS-1mainly interacts with the angiogenesis pathway by interacting with the VEGF-receptor complex. Aganirsen therefore reduces angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF and inflammatory cytokines production upstream by specifically targeting IRS-1 mRNA.<ref>Salman Al-Mahmood, Sylvie Colin, Nada Farhat, Eric Thorin, Céline Steverlynck, and Sylvain Chemtob,Potent in Vivo Antiangiogenic Effects of GS-101 (5’- TATCCGGAGGGCTCGCCATGCTGCT-3’), an Antisense Oligonucleotide Preventing the Expression of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1, ''THE JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTIC'', February 9, 2009</ref>
