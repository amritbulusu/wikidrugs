Vital to the pharmacological action of clocortolone is the presence and location of its functional groups. There were several molecular modifications done to create clocortolone pivalate, including beta-hydroxylation at C-11, methylation at C-16, double bonds at C-12, esterification at C-21, and halogenation at C-6 and C-9. It is common in the medical community to associate halogenation of topical corticosteroids with adverse effects. This notion is, in fact, incorrect—it is both the presence and location of halogenation in steroids that matter. In comparison to all other topical corticosteroids, the combination of the chlorine at C-9 and the fluorine at C-6 is unique to clocortolone. Clocortolone pivalate, due to its unique nature, has both upper-mid potency and the safety profile associated with a lower potency topical corticosteroid. This versatility allows for Cloderm cream to be a treatment option for a variety of patients.<ref name=":0" />

 
In Phase III trials, Cloderm was found to be especially useful in treating eczema, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis.<ref name=":0" /> Phase III trials also showed rapid action and relief for the majority of the patients involved. There is no age restriction on the use of clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Spotlight on Clocortolone Pivalate: Discussion and Case Reports|last = Hougeir|first = F.G.|date = July 2013|journal = JDD: Current Clinical Solutions|doi = |pmid = }}</ref> Clinical trials comparing clocortolone pivalate 0.1% topical cream with vehicle in atopic dermatitis/eczematous dermatitis, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis included pediatric patients (N=44). The mean age of pediatric subjects was 10 years (range 3–14 years). Clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream was efficacious for the majority (75%) of the pediatric patients in these trials, with no serious adverse effects occurring in either group.<ref name=":1" />

 
Additionally, a clinical study investigated the potential of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Ten men with no major health issues applied 30g of clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream twice a day for 21 days while wearing a plastic sweat suit for twelve hours per day. Through the measurements of plasma cortisol and urinary 17-ketosteroid levels, the investigators monitored effects on the HPA axis, and no signs of adrenal suppression were evident.<ref name=":2" />

 
In total to date, 559 patients have participated in clinical trials involving Cloderm, and there was little evidence of local and/or systemic adverse effects.<ref name=":2" /> Specifically, only 4.4 percent experienced adverse events, most of which were local application-site reactions, such as dryness, stinging, burning, or itching.<ref name=":1" />
