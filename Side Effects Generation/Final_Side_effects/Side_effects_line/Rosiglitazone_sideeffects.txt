A [[meta-analysis]] in May 2007 reported the use of rosiglitazone was associated with a 1.4 fold increased risk of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and a numerically higher (but non-significant) increase in risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases against control. It contained 42 trials of which 27 were unpublished.<ref name="pmid17517853" /> Another meta analysis of 4 trials with follow-up longer than 1 year found similar results.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|author2=Loke, YK |author3=Furberg, CD |title=Long-term risk of cardiovascular events with rosiglitazone: a meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Sep 12, 2007|volume=298|issue=10|pages=1189–95|pmid=17848653|doi=10.1001/jama.298.10.1189}}</ref> Nissen's meta analysis was criticized in an 2007 article by George Diamond ''et al'' in the [[Annals of Internal Medicine]].  The authors concluded that Nissens' analysis had excluded trials with important data on the cardiovascular profile of rosiglitazone, had inappropriately combined trials of greatly differing design, and had inappropriately excluded trials with no cardiovascular events. The authors concluded that no firm conclusion could be drawn regarding whether rosiglitazone increased or decreased cardiovascular risk.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamond GA, Bax L, Kaul S |title=Uncertain effects of rosiglitazone on the risk for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death |journal=Ann.

Noting the recent publication by Nissen, they repeated their meta analysis including only the trials included in the Nissen study that dealt with Type II diabetics. (The Nissen study included some trials in people with other disorders.) They did not find a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events, but noted that all of the cardiovascular endpoints they analyzed showed a non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the rosiglitazone arms.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Richter B, Bandeira-Echtler E, Bergerhoff K, Clar C, Ebrahim SH |title=Rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes mellitus |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD006063 |year=2007 |pmid=17636824 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006063.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

 
A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies released in March, 2011, compared rosiglitazone to pioglitazone, finding support for greater cardiovascular safety for pioglitazone. The meta-analysis involved 810 000 patients taking rosiglitazone or [[pioglitazone]]. The study suggests 170 excess myocardial infarctions, 649 excess cases of heart failure, and 431 excess deaths for every 100 000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone.<ref name="pmid21415101">{{cite journal |vauthors=Loke YK, Kwok CS, Singh S | title = Comparative cardiovascular effects of thiazolidinediones: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | issue = | pages = d1309 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21415101 | pmc = 3230110 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d1309 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author = Hughes S | title = More damning data on rosiglitazone | url = http://www.theheart.org/article/1199863.do | publisher = theheart.org | accessdate = 6 April 2011 | date = 27 March 2011 }}</ref> This was confirmed by another meta-analysis involving 945 286 patients in 8 retrospective cohort studies, most in the US.<ref name=Chen2012/>

 
Senators Democrat [[Max Baucus]] and Republican [[Charles Grassley]] filed a report urging GSK to withdraw Avandia in 2008 due to the side effects. The report noted the drug caused 500 avoidable heart attacks a month, and Glaxo officials sought to intimidate doctors who criticized the drug. It also said GSK continued to sell and promote the drug despite knowing the increased risk of heart attacks and stroke.<ref name="urlInteractive: Timeline: The story of Avandia | Need to Know | PBS">{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/health/timeline-history-of-avandia/2314/ | title = Interactive: Timeline: The story of Avandia &#124; Need to Know | publisher = PBS | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref>
