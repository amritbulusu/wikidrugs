'''Dimethoxybromoamphetamine''' ('''DOB'''), also known as '''brolamfetamine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]])<ref name="Organization2000">{{cite book|author=World Health Organization|title=International Nonproprietary Names (INN) for Pharmaceutical Substances|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcogPwAACAAJ|year=2000|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-0-11-986227-0}}</ref> and '''bromo-DMA''', is a [[psychedelic drug]] and [[substituted amphetamine]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] class of compounds. DOB was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]] in 1967.<ref name="dob-pihkal">[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal062.shtml Erowid Online Books : "PiHKAL" - #62 DOB]</ref><ref name=dob1973>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000136181 |title=4-Bromo-2,5-Dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine, a New Centrally Active Amphetamine Analog}}</ref> Its synthesis and effects are documented in Shulgin's book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story]]''.

 
The full name of the chemical is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine. DOB has a [[stereocenter]] and ''R''-(–)-DOB is the [[eutomer]]. This is an important finding as it is suggestive that it is targeting different receptors relative to most other [[phenethylamines]] (e.g. [[MDMA]]) where the ''R''-isomer serves as the [[distomer]]. The toxicity of DOB is not fully known, although high doses may cause serious [[vasoconstriction]] of the extremities. DOB is one of the most potent compounds in PiHKAL; while the active dose is similar to that of [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine|DOI]], another psychedelic amphetamine, DOB has been shown to have a higher efficacy in triggering downstream effects mediated by 5-HT2 receptors,<ref name="parrish-2005">Parrish JC, Braden MR, Gundy E & Nichols DE (2005). Differential phospholipase-C activation by phenylalkylamine serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists. ''J. Neurochem''. 95: 1575-1584.</ref> making it likely to be slightly more dangerous than DOI in overdose, due to greater vasoconstrictive action.  Omission of the amphetamine related α-methyl leads to [[2C-B]], a compound that possesses a lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor and is a weaker receptor agonist which results in drastically reduced vasoconstriction.

 
DOB is a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] [[partial agonist]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009019| pmid = 20126400| pmc = 2814854| title = Psychedelics and the Human Receptorome| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = e9019| year = 2010| last1 = Ray | first1 = T. S. }}</ref> Its psychedelic effects are mediated by its [[agonist]]ic properties at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOB is often used in scientific research when studying the [[5-HT2|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]] subfamily. It is an agonist of human [[TAAR1]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Articleid 50034244 |url=http://www.bindingdb.org/jsp/dbsearch/PrimarySearch_pubmed.jsp?pubmed=50034244&pubmed_submit=TBD|work=Binding Database|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>
