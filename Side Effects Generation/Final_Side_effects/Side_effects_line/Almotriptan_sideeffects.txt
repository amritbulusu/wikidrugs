The efficacy and tolerability of almotriptan has been studied in numerous randomised, control-led trials totaling more than 4800 adults with either moderate or severe attacks of migraine. Its efficacy is significantly more effective than placebo and alleviates [[nausea]], [[photophobia]] and [[phonophobia]] linked to migraine attacks. Almotriptan has similar efficacy as a standard dose of [[sumatriptan]], another triptan drug, and fewer adverse effects.<ref name=Keam2002 />
