β<sub>2</sub> agonists increase energy utilization and fat metabolism, however, therapeutic use for [[obesity]] has been limited by the concomitant activation of [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub> receptor]]s resulting in excessive increases in heart rate. A recent 2012 dose-finding study (in healthy men) demonstrated significantly increased resting energy expenditure, and fat oxidation at a dose  of 160&nbsp;μg of formoterol per day without significantly increased heart rate. Formoterol's specificity for the β<sub>2</sub> receptor (relative to β<sub>1</sub> receptors) may facilitate its use for this purpose. A combination of a highly selective β<sub>2</sub> agonist like formeterol with a low dose highly selective β<sub>1</sub> blocker may further improve the differential therapeutic ability to selectively agonize β<sub>2</sub> receptors for metabolic benefits in treating obesity without adverse β<sub>1</sub> agonist effects.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/ijo.2012.90 | issn=1476-5497 | volume=37 | issue=4 | pages=593–597 | last=Lee | first=P |author2=Day, RO |author3=Greenfield, JR |author4= Ho, KKY  | title=Formoterol, a highly β2-selective agonist, increases energy expenditure and fat utilisation in men | journal=International Journal of Obesity| date=May 29, 2012|pmid=22641064}}</ref>
