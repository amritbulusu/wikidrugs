Nicorandil is an [[Antianginal|anti-angina]] medication that has the dual properties of a [[nitrate]] and [[ATP-sensitive K+ channels|K+ATP channel]] agonist.<ref name=Nakae>{{cite journal|last=Nakae|first=I |author2=Matsumoto, T |author3=Horie, H |author4=Yokohama, H |author5=Omura, T |author6=Minai, K |author7=Matsui, T |author8=Nozawa, M |author9=Takahashi, M |author10=Sugimoto, Y |author11=Ito, M |author12=Izumi, M |author13=Nakamura, Y |author14=Mitsunami, K |author15=Kinoshita, M |title=Effects of intravenous nicorandil on coronary circulation in humans: plasma concentration and action mechanism.|journal=Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology|date=Jun 2000|volume=35|issue=6|pages=919–25|pmid=10836727|doi=10.1097/00005344-200006000-00014}}</ref> In humans, the nitrate action of nicorandil dilates the large coronary arteries at low plasma concentrations.<ref name="Nakae" /> At high plasma concentrations nicorandil reduces coronary vascular resistance, which is associated with increased K+ATP channel opening.<ref name="Nakae" />

 
The effect of nicorandil as a [[vasodilator]] is mainly attributed to its nitrate property.<ref name="Nakae" /> Yet, nicorandil is effective in cases where nitrates, such as [[nitroglycerine]], are not effective.<ref name="Nakae" /> Studies show that this is due to its K+ATP channel agonist action which causes pharmacological preconditioning and provides cardioprotective effects against ischemia.<ref name="Nakae" /> Nicorandil activates K+ATP channels in the mitochondria of the myocardium, which appears to relay the cardioprotective effects, although the mechanism is still unclear.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Y|author2=Sato, T |author3=O'Rourke, B |author4= Marban, E |title=Mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channels: novel effectors of cardioprotection?|journal=Circulation|date=Jun 23, 1998|volume=97|issue=24|pages=2463–9|pmid=9641699 |doi=10.1161/01.cir.97.24.2463}}</ref>

 
== Side effects ==

 
Side effects listed in the British National Formulary include flushing, [[palpitations]], weakness and vomiting. More recently, [[perianal]], [[ileal]] and peristomal ulceration has been reported as a side effect. Anal ulceration is now included in the [[British National Formulary]] as a reported side effect. Other side effects include severe toothache, and nasal congestion.
