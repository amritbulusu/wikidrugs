The sedative effects of cyclobenzaprine are likely due to its antagonistic effect on [[H1 receptor|histamine]], [[Serotonin receptor|serotonin]], and [[muscarinic receptor]]s. Agitation is a common side effect observed especially in the elderly. In general, the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] recommends avoiding the use of cyclobenzaprine in the elderly because of the potential for more severe side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |accessdate=22 February 2010 |title=High risk medications |format=PDF |work=[[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201113909/http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related [[tricyclic]], such as [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.<ref name=chabria>{{cite journal |last = Chabria |first = Shiven B |url = http://www.occup-med.com/content/1/1/16 |journal = Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology |title = Rhabdomyolysis: a manifestation of cyclobenzaprine toxicity |date = 17 July 2006 |volume = 1 |page = 16 |pmid = 16846511 |doi = 10.1186/1745-6673-1-16 |pmc = 1540431 |issue = 1 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061021190258/http://www.occup-med.com/content/1/1/16 |archivedate = 21 October 2006 }}</ref>

 
The most common effects of overdose are drowsiness and [[tachycardia]].<ref name = FDA /> Rare but potentially critical complications are [[cardiac arrest]], [[cardiac dysrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], severe [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[seizure]]s, and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name = FDA /> Life-threatening overdose is rare,<ref name = FDA /> however, as the [[median lethal dose]] is about 338&nbsp;milligrams/kilogram in mice and 425&nbsp;mg/kg in rats.<ref name = FDA /> The potential harm is increased when [[Depressant|central nervous system depressants]] and antidepressants are also used; deliberate overdose often includes [[alcohol]] among other drugs.<ref name = FDA />

Cyclobenzaprine has been found to be not inferior to [[tizanidine]], [[orphenadrine]], and [[carisoprodol]] in the treatment of acute lower back pain, although none has been proven to be effective for long-term use (beyond two weeks of treatment). No differences in pain or spasm scores were noted among these agents, nor when compared to benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/572676_4 |title = Medscape: Medscape Access |work = medscape.com |accessdate = 1 October 2016 }}</ref> However, nonbenzodiazepine (including cyclobenzaprine) treatment was found to have a lower risk of medication abuse and continuation of use against medical advice. Side effects such as sedation and [[ataxia]] are also less pronounced with nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodics.
