''[[Listening to Prozac]]'' (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. ''Talking Back to Prozac'' (1994), by psychiatrist [[Peter Breggin]], focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper [[Jay-Z]] referenced Prozac in the song, "[[Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)|Nigga What, Nigga Who]]" (1998). In [[HBO]]'s fictional series, ''[[The Sopranos]]'', [[Tony Soprano]]'s use of Prozac is periodically referenced.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
