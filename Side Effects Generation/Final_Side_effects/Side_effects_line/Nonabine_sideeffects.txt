'''Nonabine''' ('''BRL-4664''') is a drug which is a [[cannabinoid]] derivative, which was developed for the prevention of [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] associated with [[cancer]] [[chemotherapy]].<ref>Staquet M, Bron D, Rozencweig M, Kenis Y. Clinical studies with a THC analog (BRL-4664) in the prevention of cisplatin-induced vomiting. ''Journal of Clinical Pharmacology''. 1981 Aug-Sep;21(8-9 Suppl):60S-63S. {{PMID|7197692}}</ref> It has strong [[antiemetic]] effects equivalent to those of [[chlorpromazine]], and also produces some mild [[sedative]] effects, along with [[dry mouth]] and [[EEG]] changes typical of cannabinoid agonists, but with minimal changes in mood or perception, suggesting the abuse potential is likely to be low.<ref>Archer CB, Amlot PL, Trounce JR.
