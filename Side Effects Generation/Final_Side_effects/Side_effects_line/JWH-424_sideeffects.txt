'''JWH-424''' is a drug from the [[naphthoylindole]] family, which acts as a [[cannabinoid]] agonist at both the [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cannabinoid receptor 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], but with moderate selectivity for CB<sub>2</sub>, having a [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|K<sub>i</sub>]] of 5.44nM at CB<sub>2</sub> vs 20.9nM at CB<sub>1</sub>. The heavier 8-[[Iodine|iodo]] analogue is even more CB<sub>2</sub> selective, with its 2-methyl derivative having 40x selectivity for CB<sub>2</sub>. However the 1-propyl homologues in this series showed much lower affinity at both receptors, reflecting a generally reduced affinity for the 8-substituted naphthoylindoles overall.<ref>Valerie Smith, John Huffman, Jenny Wiley and Billy Martin.
