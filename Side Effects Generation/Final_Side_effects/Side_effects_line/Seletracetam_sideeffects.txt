==Adverse effects and tolerance==

 
Unlike currently prescribed [[anticonvulsants]] such as phenytoin, [[valproate]], and [[phenobarbital]], seletracetam shows few [[central nervous system]] (CNS) side effects and is predicted to have low levels of drug-drug interactions due to its low binding (<10%) to plasma proteins.<ref name="Bennett" /><ref name = "Brodie">{{cite journal|last=Brodie|first=MJ|title=Do we need any more new antiepileptic drugs?|journal=Epilepsy research|date=May 2001|volume=45|issue=1–3|pages=3–6|pmid=11461782|doi=10.1016/S0920-1211(01)00203-0}}</ref>  There have been, however, no formal studies conducted on drug-drug interactions with seletracetam.<ref name=Bialer />

 
Other than [[SV2A]] and the high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, seletracetam does not significantly bind to other CNS receptors, ion channels, or uptake mechanisms.<ref name=Bialer /> Seletracetam has, however, shown a slight selectivity for glycine receptors.<ref name=Bialer /><ref name=Luszcki>{{cite journal|last=Luszczki|first=JJ|title=Third-generation antiepileptic drugs: mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics and interactions|journal=Pharmacological reports : PR|date=Mar–Apr 2009|volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=197–216 |pmid=19443931 |doi=10.1016/s1734-1140(09)70024-6}}</ref><ref name=Bialer2004>{{cite journal|last=Bialer|first=M|author2=Johannessen, SI |author3=Kupferberg, HJ |author4=Levy, RH |author5=Perucca, E |author6= Tomson, T |title=Progress report on new antiepileptic drugs: a summary of the Seventh Eilat Conference (EILAT VII)|journal=Epilepsy research|date=Sep–Oct 2004|volume=61|issue=1–3|pages=1–48|pmid=15570674|doi=10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2004.07.010}}</ref> This drug neither inhibits nor unnecessarily induces the action of any major human metabolizing enzymes, which further reduces adverse effects.<ref name=Brodie />

 
In phase II trials side effects were limited to the CNS in origin, were of mild to moderate severity, and most were resolved within 24 hours<ref name="Bennett" /> and with no medical intervention.<ref name=Bialer /> The most frequently reported adverse effects of seletracetam were dizziness, feeling drunk, euphoria, nausea, and [[somnolence]].<ref name=Bialer />

 
Seletracetam was well tolerated by healthy individuals after single oral doses ranging from 2 to 600&nbsp;mg, as well as after b.i.d. (twice daily) doses of 200&nbsp;mg.<ref name=Bialer /> [[Toxicology]] studies have shown that this drug has low acute oral toxicity and no significant negative effects on the CNS, cardiac, or respiratory systems.<ref name=Bialer /> High doses of 2000&nbsp;mg/kg per day (in mice and rats) and greater than 600&nbsp;mg/kg per day (in dogs) were poorly tolerated.<ref name=Bialer />
