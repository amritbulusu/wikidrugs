Oxprenolol is a [[lipophilic]] beta blocker which passes the [[blood–brain barrier]] more easily than water-soluble beta blockers.  As such, it is associated with a higher incidence of [[Central nervous system|CNS]]-related side effects than hydrophilic ligands such as [[atenolol]], [[sotalol]] and [[nadolol]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=McDevitt DG |title=Comparison of pharmacokinetic properties of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs |series=8 |journal=Eur.
