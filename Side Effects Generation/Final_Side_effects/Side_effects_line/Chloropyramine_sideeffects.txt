Chloropyramine is known as a competitive reversible H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist (also known as an H<sub>1</sub> inverse agonist), meaning that it exerts its pharmacological action by competing with [[histamine]] for the H<sub>1</sub> subtype histamine receptor. By blocking the effects of histamine, the drug inhibits the vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and tissue edema associated with histamine release in the tissue. The H<sub>1</sub> antagonistic properties of chloropyramine can be used by researchers for the purposes of blocking the effects of [[histamine]] on cells and tissues. In addition, chloropyramine has some [[anticholinergic]] properties.<ref name = "PI" />

 
Chloropyramine's anticholinergic properties and the fact that it can pass through the [[blood–brain barrier]] are linked to its clinical side effects: drowsiness, weakness, vertigo, fatigue, dryness in the mouth, constipation, and rarely — visual disturbances and increase of intraocular pressure.

 
Chloropyramine should not be used internally with alcohol, sedative drugs and hypnotics because of the potentiation of the effects. It should be used with caution in patients suffering from [[hyperthyroidism]], cardiovascular diseases and asthma. In children, it can induce agitation, and in many adult patients dizziness may be observed. Because of the pronounced sedative effect the preparation should be prescribed cautiously in drivers and people working with machines.
