Methoxsalen is extracted from ''[[Ammi majus]]'', a plant of the family [[Apiaceae]]. The substance is also present in other Apiaceae as well as [[Rutaceae]], for example [[monarda|bergamot]] oil which is used in many perfumes and aromatherapy oils. When these products are applied to skin and exposed to UVA radiation, the skin may turn brownish due to the phototoxic effects of methoxsalen present in the bergamot oil.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bergamot | url=http://www.oilsandplants.com/bergamot.htm | publisher=oilsandplants.com | accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> Most modern perfumes containing bergamot have the Methoxsalen removed.

 
== Risks and side effects ==

 
Patients with [[high blood pressure]] or a history of [[liver]] problems are at risk for inflammation and irreparable damage to both liver and skin.  The eyes must be protected from UVA radiation.  Side effects include [[nausea]], [[headache]]s, [[dizziness]], and in rare cases [[insomnia]]. Methoxsalen has also been classified as an [[IARC Group 1 carcinogen]] (known to cause cancer) but is only cancerous when combined with UVA radiation.<ref>http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/generalinformationaboutcarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens</ref>
