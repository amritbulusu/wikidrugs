Following experimental research into NHE-activation and its effects on myocardial injury, cariporide was proposed for a Phase I trial to test whether inhibition of the NHE approves myocardial function in patients undergoing [[Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty|percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty]] (PCTA).<ref name=":1">Hans-Jürgen Rupprecht, J.v.D., Wolfram Terres, Karl Melchior Seyfarth, Gert Richardt, Heinz-Peter Schultheiß, Michael Buerke, Florence H.

'''101''': p. 2902-2908.</ref> Results of this trial were published in 2000. A group of 100 individuals were placed in two trial groups. The first group was given a 40-mg intravaneous bolus dose of cariporide prior to reperfusion. A second group was given a placebo. 21 days post-injection, patients in the cariporide group showed a number of improvements over the placebo group. This trial proved NHE inhibition with cariporide may be an effective way to aid recovery post-PCTA.<ref name=":1" />

 
The primary goals of the GUARDIAN trial were to assess (1) the rate of death or [[myocardial infarction]] at day 36 in the four trial groups and (2) the large-scale safety and side effects associated with cariporide. Results showed that 20- and 80-mg doses were statistically similar to the placebo group, while the 120-mg group showed a 10% relative risk reduction and similar mortality rates.<ref name=":3">Boyce, S.W., et al., ''Impact of sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibition by cariporide on death or myocardial infarction in high-risk CABG surgery patients: results of the CABG surgery cohort of the GUARDIAN study.''

The second group received a placebo. The results of the trial showed a statistically significant decline in mortality or myocardial infarction from 20.3% to 16.6%. However, when looked at individually, the rate of myocardial infarction declined from 18.9% to 14.4%, while mortality increased 0.7%. Due to the increase in mortality, cariporide did not pass clinical trials.<ref name=":4">Mentzer, R.M., Jr., et al., ''Sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibition by cariporide to reduce the risk of ischemic cardiac events in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting: results of the EXPEDITION study.''

The largest clinical trial for cariporide found no significant adverse effects of cariporide on patients (see Phase III: GUARDIAN Trial).<ref name=":2" /> However, a later clinical trial found dose-dependent increases in mortality for patients using cariporide post-CABG (see Phase III: EXPEDITION Trial).<ref name=":4" />
