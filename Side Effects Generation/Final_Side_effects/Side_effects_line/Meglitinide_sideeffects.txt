== Side-effects ==

 
Side effects include weight gain and [[hypoglycemia]].  While the potential for hypoglycemia is less than for those on [[sulfonylurea]]s, it is still a serious potential side effect that can be life-threatening.  Patients on this medication should know the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and appropriate management.
