The Persian physician [[Avicenna|Abū ‘Alī al-Husayn ibn Sina]] ("Avicenna") described opium as the most powerful of the stupefacients, in comparison to mandrake and other highly effective herbs, in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. The text lists medicinal effects of opium, such as analgesia, hypnosis, antitussive effects, gastrointestinal effects, cognitive effects, respiratory depression, neuromuscular disturbances, and sexual dysfunction. It also refers to opium's potential as a poison. Avicenna describes several methods of delivery and recommendations for doses of the drug.<ref name="Medicinal aspects of opium as described in Avicenna's Canon of Medicine.">{{cite journal|title=Medicinal aspects of opium as described in Avicenna's Canon of Medicine|journal=Acta medico-historica Adriatica |date=2013 |pmid=23883087 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=101–12 |last1=Heydari |first1=M|last2=Hashempur|first2=M.

During the 18th century, opium was found to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its sedative and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia.<ref name="KramerJohn">{{cite journal | author = Kramer John C | year = 1979 | title = Opium Rampant: Medical Use, Misuse and Abuse in Britain and the West in the 17th and 18th Centuries | url = | journal = British Journal Of Addiction | volume = 74 | issue = 4| pages = 377–389 }}</ref> However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause anger or depression, and due to the drug's euphoric effects, it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get used to being high.<ref name="KramerJohn" />

Globally, opium has gradually been superseded by a variety of purified, semi-synthetic, and synthetic [[opioids]] with progressively stronger effects, and by other [[general anesthetics]]. This process began in 1804, when [[Friedrich Sertürner|Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner]] first isolated morphine from the opium poppy.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Morimoto | first=Satoshi |author2=Kazunari Suemori |author3=Jun Moriwaki |author4=Futoshi Taura |author5=Hiroyuki Tanaka |author6=Mariko Aso |author7=Masakazu Tanaka |author8=Hiroshi Suemune |author9=Yasuyuki Shimohigashi |author10=Yukihiro Shoyama | title= Morphine Metabolism in the Opium Poppy and Its Possible Physiological Function | journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume=276 | issue=41 | pages=38179–38184| date=October 12, 2001 | pmid= 11498543| url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M107105200 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M107105200 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de/index.php?id=titel_16_2004 |title=Dem Morphin auf der Spur |publisher=Pharmazeutische-zeitung.de |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> The process continued until 1817, when Sertürner published the isolation of pure [[morphine]] from opium after at least thirteen years of research and a nearly disastrous trial on himself and three boys.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Huxtable Ryan J. |author2=Schwartz Stephen K.

Morphine was the first pharmaceutical isolated from a natural product, and this success encouraged the isolation of other alkaloids: by 1820, isolations of [[noscapine]], [[strychnine]], [[veratrine]], [[colchicine]], [[caffeine]], and [[quinine]] were reported. Morphine sales began in 1827, by [[Heinrich Emanuel Merck]] of Darmstadt, and helped him expand his family pharmacy into the [[Merck KGaA]] pharmaceutical company.

 
Heroin is widely preferred because of increased potency. One study in postaddicts found heroin to be approximately 2.2 times more potent than [[morphine]] by weight with a similar duration; at these relative quantities, they could distinguish the drugs subjectively but had no preference.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=W.

The smoking of opium does not involve the [[pyrolysis|burning]] of the material as might be imagined. Rather, the prepared opium is indirectly heated to temperatures at which the active alkaloids, chiefly morphine, are vaporized. In the past, smokers would use a specially designed [[opium pipe]] which had a removable knob-like pipe-bowl of fired earthenware attached by a metal fitting to a long, cylindrical stem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opiummuseum.com/|title=The Opium Museum}}</ref> A small "pill" of opium about the size of a pea would be placed on the pipe-bowl, which was then heated by holding it over an [[opium lamp]], a special oil lamp with a distinct funnel-like chimney to channel heat into a small area. The smoker would lie on his or her side in order to guide the pipe-bowl and the tiny pill of opium over the stream of heat rising from the chimney of the oil lamp and inhale the vaporized opium fumes as needed. Several pills of opium were smoked at a single session depending on the smoker's tolerance to the drug. The effects could last up to twelve hours.

 
Opium contains two main groups of [[alkaloid]]s. [[Phenanthrene]]s such as [[morphine]], [[codeine]], and [[thebaine]] are the main psychoactive constituents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homehealth-uk.com/medical/professional_drugtests_opiates.htm |title=Opiates |publisher=Homehealth-uk.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Isoquinolines]] such as [[papaverine]] and [[noscapine]] have no significant [[central nervous system]] effects, and are not regulated under the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is responsible for most of its harmful effects such as [[lung edema]], respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates [[mu opioid receptor]] in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to [[drug tolerance]] or [[physical dependence]].
