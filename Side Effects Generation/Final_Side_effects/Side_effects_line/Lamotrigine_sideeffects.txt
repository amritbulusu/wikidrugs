Lamotrigine is a [[phenyltriazine]], making it chemically distinct from other approved anticonvulsants. It enhances the action of [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS; which consists of the brain and spinal cord).<ref>{{cite web| url= https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3878#section=Top| title= Lamotrigine| website= PubChem Open Chemistry Database| publisher= National Institutes of Health| location= US| access-date= December 13, 2016}}</ref> Lamotrigine may also inhibit voltage-gated [[sodium channel]]s thereby suppressing the release of [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]], two of the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the CNS.<ref>{{cite web|title=DailyMed - LAMOTRIGINE - lamotrigine chewable dispersible tablet, for suspension|url=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=05cba628-b12c-44d8-89a8-3522fe417cc1|website=DailyMed|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref> It is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of [[antiepileptic drugs]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Rogawski MA, Löscher W | title = The neurobiology of antiepileptic drugs | journal = Nat Rev Neurosci | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 553–564 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15208697 | doi=10.1038/nrn1430}}</ref> but it could have additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as [[phenytoin]] and [[carbamazepine]] and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its [[sigma receptor]] activity.

Side-effects such as rash, fever, and fatigue are very serious, as they may indicate incipient Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome or aseptic meningitis.<ref name="drugs.com">http://www.rxlist.com/lamictal-drug.htm</ref>

 
Other side-effects include loss of balance or coordination; [[diplopia|double vision]]; [[strabismus|crossed eyes]]; pupil constriction; blurred vision; [[dizziness]] and lack of coordination; drowsiness, [[insomnia]]; anxiety; vivid dreams or [[nightmare]]s; [[dry mouth]], mouth ulcers;<ref name="GSKprescribing"/>  [[memory]] problems; mood changes; itchiness; runny nose; cough; [[nausea]], indigestion, abdominal pain, weight loss; missed or painful [[menstrual period]]s; and [[vaginitis]].

Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent [[sodium channels]], lamotrigine inhibited the release of [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]] evoked by the sodium-channel activator [[veratrine]] and was less effective in the inhibition of [[acetylcholine]] or [[GABA]] release. At high concentrations, it had no effect on spontaneous or [[potassium]] evoked amino acid release.<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov"/>

 
These studies suggested that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on [[voltage-gated sodium channels]] to decrease [[glutamate]] release. Several electrophysiological studies have investigated the effects of lamotrigine on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant in the treatment of human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These and a variety of other results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like that of [[phenytoin]] and [[carbamazepine]], is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to be protective against generalised [[absence epilepsy]] and other generalised epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalised [[tonic–clonic]] seizures, [[juvenile myoclonic epilepsy]], and [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]].

 
The capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences of [[melanin]] binding is unknown.  Clinical trials excluded subtle effects and optimal duration of treatment.  There are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring.  Lamotrigine binds to the eye and melanin-containing tissues which can accumulate over time and may cause toxicity.   Prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects and base treatment on  clinical response.  Patient compliance should be periodically reassessed with lab and medical testing of liver and kidney function to monitor progress or side effects.<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov"/>
