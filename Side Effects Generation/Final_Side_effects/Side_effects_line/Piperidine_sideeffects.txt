Piperidine is used as a [[solvent]] and as a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. The same is true for certain derivatives: [[N-formylpiperidine|''N''-formylpiperidine]] is a [[polar aprotic solvent]] with better hydrocarbon solubility than other amide solvents, and [[2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine]] is a highly [[steric effects|sterically hindered]] base, useful because of its low [[nucleophilicity]] and high solubility in [[organic solvent]]s.
