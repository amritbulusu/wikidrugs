Studies were conducted to look for increased adverse effects in the elderly population as compared to younger patients. One such study published in Epilepsy Research showed no significant increase in incidence of adverse symptoms experienced by young or elderly patients with central nervous system (CNS) disorders.<sup>[16]</sup>

 
== Adverse effects ==

 
The most common adverse effects of levetiracetam treatment include CNS effects such as somnolence, decreased energy, headache, dizziness, mood swings and coordination difficulties. These adverse effects are most pronounced in the first month of therapy. About 4% of patients dropped out of pre-approval clinical trials due to these side effects.<ref name=":0" />

 
About 13% of people taking levetiracetam experience adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are usually mild. These include agitation, hostility, apathy, anxiety, emotional lability, and depression. Serious psychiatric adverse side effects that are reversed by drug discontinuation occur in about 1%. These include hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, or psychosis. These occurred mostly within the first month of therapy, but they could develop at any time during treatment.<ref name="pmid18728811">{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/NDT.S1655 |pmid=18728811 |pmc=2515905 |title=Monotherapy for partial epilepsy: Focus on levetiracetam |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=33–8 |year=2008 |last1=Gambardella |first1=Antonio }}</ref>
