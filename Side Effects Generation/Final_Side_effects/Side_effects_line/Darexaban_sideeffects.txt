Darexaban is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized in the liver to its active metabolite, darexaban [[glucuronide]] (YM-222714) during [[first pass metabolism]] via [[glucuronidation]].<ref>Turpie, A., et al. "Prevention of venous thromboembolism with an oral factor Xa inhibitor, YM150, after total hip arthoplasty. A dose finding study (ONYX-2)." Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010): 714-721</ref> The metabolism of darexaban also occurs in the small intestine but to a much lesser extent.<ref name=Yoshiyuki/> Glucuronidation of darexaban occurs quickly, thus the half life of darexaban itself is short. However, the resultant darexaban glucuronide metabolite has a long half life of approximately 14–18 hours, reaching its maximum levels in the blood 1-1.5 hour post dose.<ref name=Yoshiyuki/> As a result, darexaban glucuronide is the main determinant of the antithrombotic effects.<ref name=Toshifumi/> Darexaban shows minimal interaction with food and is excreted through the kidneys (urine) and feces.<ref name=Steg>{{cite journal | pmid = 21878434 | year = 2011 | last1 = Steg | first1 = PG | last2 = Mehta | first2 = SR | last3 = Jukema | first3 = JW | last4 = Lip | first4 = GY | last5 = Gibson | first5 = CM | last6 = Kovar | first6 = F | last7 = Kala | first7 = P | last8 = Garcia-Hernandez | first8 = A | last9 = Renfurm | first9 = RW | last10 = Granger | first10 = CB | last11 = Ruby-1 | first11 = Investigators | title = RUBY-1: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the safety and tolerability of the novel oral factor Xa inhibitor darexaban (YM150) following acute coronary syndrome | volume = 32 | issue = 20 | pages = 2541–54 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehr334 | pmc = 3295208 | journal = European Heart Journal }}</ref>
