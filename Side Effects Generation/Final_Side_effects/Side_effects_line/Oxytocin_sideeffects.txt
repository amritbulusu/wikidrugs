In the [[hypothalamus]], oxytocin is made in [[magnocellular neurosecretory cell]]s of the [[supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular]] nuclei, and is stored in [[Herring bodies]] at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the [[posterior pituitary|posterior lobe]] ([[neurohypophysis]]) of the [[pituitary gland]]. These [[axons]] (likely, but [[dendrites]] have not been ruled out) have collaterals that innervate neurons in the [[nucleus accumbens]], a brain structure where oxytocin receptors are expressed.<ref name="Ross">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross HE, Cole CD, Smith Y, Neumann ID, Landgraf R, Murphy AZ, Young LJ | title = Characterization of the oxytocin system regulating affiliative behavior in female prairie voles | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 892–903 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19482070 | pmc = 2744157 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.05.055 }}</ref> The [[endocrine system|endocrine]] effects of hormonal oxytocin and the cognitive or behavioral effects of oxytocin [[neuropeptide]]s are thought to be coordinated through its common release through these collaterals.<ref name="Ross"/> Oxytocin is also produced by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project to other parts of the brain and to the spinal cord.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Landgraf R, Neumann ID | title = Vasopressin and oxytocin release within the brain: a dynamic concept of multiple and variable modes of neuropeptide communication | journal = Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology | volume = 25 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 150–76 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15589267 | doi = 10.1016/j.yfrne.2004.05.001 }}</ref> Depending on the species, oxytocin receptor-expressing cells are located in other areas, including the [[amygdala]] and [[Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis|bed nucleus]] of the [[stria terminalis]].
