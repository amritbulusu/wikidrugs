'''Ethocybin''' ('''CEY-19'''; 4-phosphoryloxy-DET; 4-PO-DET) is a [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of the mushroom [[alkaloid]] [[psilocybin]], and a [[semi-synthetic]] [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[alkaloid]] of the [[tryptamine]] family. Effects of ethocybin are comparable to those of a shorter [[LSD]] or [[psilocybin]], although intensity and duration vary depending on dosage, individual physiology, and [[set and setting]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

 
As with psilocybin, ethocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to [[4-HO-DET]]  which then acts as a [[partial agonist]] at the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[serotonin receptor]] in the brain where it mimics the effects of [[serotonin]] (5-HT).{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

 
== Effects ==

 
Ethocybin is absorbed through the lining of the mouth and stomach. Effects begin 20-45 minutes after ingestion, and last from 2-4 hours depending on dose, species, and individual metabolism.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}  The effects are somewhat shorter compared to psilocybin.

 
Mental and physical tolerance to psilocybin builds and dissipates quickly. Taking ethocybin more than three or four times in a week (especially two days in a row) can result in diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so frequent users often keep doses spaced five to seven days apart to avoid the effect.
