'''Proadifen''' (SKF-525A) is a non-selective [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]]s, preventing some types of [[drug metabolism]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14161153 | year = 1964 | last1 = Marshall | first1 = FN | last2 = Williamson | first2 = HE | title = Natruretic Response During Infusion of Beta-Diethylaminoethyl-Diphenylpropyl Acetate Hydrocloride (Skf 525-A) | volume = 143 | pages = 395–400 | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics}}</ref> It is also an inhibitor of neuronal [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS), CYP-dependent (cytochrome P450-dependent) [[arachidonate]] metabolism, transmembrane calcium influx, and platelet [[thromboxane]] synthesis. Further documented effects include the blockade of ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 8 (KIR6.1), and stimulation of [[endothelial cell]] [[prostacyclin]] production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scbt.com/datasheet-200492-skf-525a-hcl-proadifen.html|title=Santa Cruz Biotech}}</ref>

 
Proadifen exerts apoptotic/anti-proliferate (tumour suppressing) effects in certain forms of cancer (HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma), believed to be caused by mediation of [[Glycogen synthase kinase 3]] β (GSK-3β). In the same study administration of proadifen was demonstrated to produce time- and dose-dependent [[phosphatidylserine]] externalization, [[caspase-3]] activation and PARP cleavage. Intense upregulation of NAG-1 and ATF3 and downregulation of Mcl-1 and Egr-1 were also observed.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Inhibition of GSK-3β reverses the pro-apoptotic effect of proadifen (SKF-525A) in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells|author= University in Košice, Slovakia; Institute of Biology and Ecology: Rastislav Jendzelovsky, Jan Koval, Jaromír Mikeš, Zuzana Jendzelovska, Jana Plsikova, and Peter Fedoročko|date=June 2012|url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225290505_Inhibition_of_GSK-3_reverses_the_pro-apoptotic_effect_of_proadifen_%28SKF-525A%29_in_HT-29_colon_adenocarcinoma_cells|journal=Toxicology in Vitro}}</ref>
