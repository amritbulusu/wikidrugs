==Side effects and toxicity==

 
The adverse effects of mechlorethamine depend on the formulation.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pro/mustargen.html Mustargen] and [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/202317lbl.pdf Valchlor]</ref> When used in chemical warfare, it can cause immunosuppression and damage to mucous membranes of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Mucous membranes and damp or damaged skin are more affected by exposure to HN-2. Though symptoms of exposure are generally delayed, the DNA damage it causes occurs very quickly. More serious exposures cause symptoms to develop sooner. Eye symptoms develop first, in the first 1–2 hours (severe exposure) or 3–12 hours (mild to moderate exposure) followed by airway (2-6/12–24 hours) and skin symptoms (6–48 hours). Hot, humid weather shortens the latent (symptom-free) period.<ref name=":0" />

 
Long-term effects of acute or chronic chlormethine exposure are caused by damage to the [[immune system]]. [[White blood cell]] counts drop, increasing the risk of infection, and [[red blood cell]] and [[platelet]] counts may also drop due to [[bone marrow]] damage. Chronic eye infections may result from exposure, but blindness is temporary. Long-term effects on the respiratory system include [[anosmia]] (inability to smell), [[ageusia]] (inability to taste), inflammation, chronic infections, fibrosis, and cancer. Skin that has been damaged by HN2 can change pigmentation or become scarred, and may eventually develop cancer.<ref name=":0" />
