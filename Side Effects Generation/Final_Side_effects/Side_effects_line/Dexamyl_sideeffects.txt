First introduced in 1950 by Smith, Kline and French, Dexamyl was marketed as an [[antidepressant]] medication that did not cause agitation, and also as an anti-anxiety drug and diet drug.  Amphetamine alone had previously been marketed as an antidepressant (under the Benzedrine Sulfate brand) beginning around 1938. The amphetamine in Dexamyl was intended to elevate mood, while the [[barbiturate]] was added to counter the side effects of the amphetamine. Its name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''dex''troamphetamine and ''amyl''barbitone.
