In a clinical study, mifamurtide was given to 332 subjects (half of whom were under age of 16) and most side effects were found to be mild to moderate in nature. Most patients experience fewer adverse events with subsequent administration.<ref name="PMID18235123">{{Cite journal

After application of the [[liposomal]] infusion, the drug is cleared from the plasma within minutes and is concentrated in lung, liver, [[spleen]], [[nasopharynx]], and [[thyroid]]. The terminal half-life is 18 hours. In patients receiving a second treatment after 11–12 weeks, no accumulation effects were observed.<ref>{{harv|EMA|2009|p=8}}</ref>

 
Mifamurtide is a fully synthetic derivative of [[muramyl dipeptide]] (MDP), the smallest naturally occurring immune stimulatory component of cell walls from ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' species. It has similar immunostimulatory effects as natural MDP with the advantage of a longer half-life in plasma.
