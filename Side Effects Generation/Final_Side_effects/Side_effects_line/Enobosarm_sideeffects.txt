Selective androgen receptor modulators may be used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to [[anabolic steroid]]s. For this reason, SARMs were banned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] in January 2008 despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs have been developed.<ref>Thevis M, Kohler M, Schlörer N, Kamber M, Kühn A, Linscheid MW, Schänzer W.
