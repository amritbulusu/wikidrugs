There is no good evidence that trifluoperazine is more effective for schizophrenia than lower-potency antipsychotics like [[chlorpromazine]], [[chlorprothixene]], [[thioridazine]] and [[levomepromazine]], but trifluoperazine appears to cause more adverse effects than these drugs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tardy|first1=M|last2=Dold|first2=M|last3=Engel|first3=RR|last4=Leucht|first4=S|title=Trifluoperazine versus low-potency first-generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=8 July 2014|issue=7|pages=CD009396|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2|pmid=25003310}}</ref>

A 2004 [[meta-analysis]] of the studies on trifluoperazine found that it is more likely than placebo to cause extrapyramidal side effects such as [[akathisia]], [[dystonia]], and [[Parkinsonism]].<ref name="Marq">{{cite journal| author = Marques LO, Lima MS, Soares BG| title = Trifluoperazine for schizophrenia| journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews| issue = 1| pages = CD003545| year = 2004| pmid = 14974020| doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003545.pub2}}</ref> It is also more likely to cause [[somnolence]] and anticholinergic side effects such as [[Red eye (medicine)|red eye]] and [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth).<ref name="Marq"/> All antipsychotics can cause the rare and sometimes fatal [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Smego RA, Durack DT | title = The neuroleptic malignant syndrome| journal = Archives of Internal Medicine| volume = 142| issue = 6| pages = 1183–5| date=June 1982| pmid = 6124221| doi = 10.1001/archinte.142.6.1183}}</ref> Trifluoperazine can lower the seizure threshold.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Hedges D, Jeppson K, Whitehead P | title = Antipsychotic medication and seizures: a review| journal = Drugs of Today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)| volume = 39| issue = 7| pages = 551–7| date=July 2003| pmid = 12973403| doi = 10.1358/dot.2003.39.7.799445}}</ref> The [[antimuscarinic]] action of trifluoperazine can cause excessive dilation of the pupils ([[mydriasis]]), which increases the chances of patients with [[hyperopia]] developing [[glaucoma]].<ref>{{cite journal| author = Boet DJ| title = Toxic effects of phenothiazines on the eye| journal = Documenta Ophthalmologica.

In the past, trifluoperazine was used in fixed combinations with the [[MAO inhibitor]] (antidepressant) [[tranylcypromine]] ([[tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine]]) to attenuate the strong stimulating effects of this antidepressant. This combination was sold under the brand name Jatrosom N. Likewise a combination with [[amobarbital]] (potent sedative/hypnotic agent) for the amelioration of [[psychoneurosis]] and [[insomnia]] existed under the brand name Jalonac. In [[Italy]] the first combination is still available, sold under the brand name Parmodalin (10&nbsp;mg of tranylcypromine and 1&nbsp;mg of trifluoperazine).
