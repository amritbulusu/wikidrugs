'''Emricasan''' ('''IDN-6556''', '''PF-03491390''') is a drug originally invented by [[Pfizer]] and licensed for development to Conatus Pharmaceuticals, which acts as a [[caspase]] inhibitor and has [[antiinflammatory]] effects. It was developed for the treatment of liver disease,<ref>Hoglen NC, Chen LS, Fisher CD, Hirakawa BP, Groessl T, Contreras PC.
