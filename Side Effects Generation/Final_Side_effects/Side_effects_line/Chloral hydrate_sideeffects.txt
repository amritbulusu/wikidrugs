Chloral hydrate is used for the short-term treatment of [[insomnia]] and as a sedative before minor medical or dental treatment. It was largely displaced in the mid-20th century by [[barbiturate]]s<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tariq | first1 = Syed H. | last2 = Pulisetty | first2 = Shailaja | year = 2008 | title = Pharmacotherapy for Insomnia | url = | journal = Clinics in Geriatric Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 93–105 | doi = 10.1016/j.cger.2007.08.009 | pmid = 18035234 }}</ref> and subsequently by [[benzodiazepine]]s. It was also formerly used in veterinary medicine as a [[general anesthetic]] but is not considered acceptable for anesthesia or euthanasia of small animals due to adverse effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Mark G.|last2=Murphy|first2=Kathy L.|last3=Taylor|first3=Polly M.|last4=Wolfensohn|first4=Sarah E.|date=2009-07-01|title=Chloral Hydrate Is Not Acceptable for Anesthesia or Euthanasia of Small Animals|url=http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1926213|journal=Anesthesiology: The Journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists|volume=111|issue=1|pages=209–209|doi=10.1097/aln.0b013e3181a8617e|issn=0003-3022}}</ref> It is also still used as a sedative prior to [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] procedures, as it is one of the few available sedatives that does not suppress [[epilepsy|epileptiform]] discharges.<ref>http://jcc.kau.edu.sa/Files/140/Researches/11822_Chloral.pdf</ref>

 
Chloral hydrate was routinely administered to people on the gram scale.  Prolonged exposure to the vapors is unhealthy however, with a [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] for 4-hour exposure of 440&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>.  Long-term use of chloral hydrate is associated with a rapid development of tolerance to its effects and possible addiction as well as adverse effects including rashes, gastric discomfort and severe kidney, heart, and liver failure.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Gelder M, Mayou R, Geddes J| year = 2005 | title = Psychiatry | edition = 3rd | location = New York: Oxford | page = 238}}</ref>

 
Chloral hydrate is metabolized ''[[in vivo]]''<ref>[[Trichloroethanol]]</ref> to [[trichloroethanol]], which is responsible for its physiological and psychological effects.<ref name=Ull>Reinhard Jira, Erwin Kopp, Blaine C.
