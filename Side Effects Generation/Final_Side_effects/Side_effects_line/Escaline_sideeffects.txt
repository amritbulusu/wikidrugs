'''Escaline''' or '''3,5-[[methoxy]]-4-[[ethoxy]][[phenethylamine]]''' is a [[psychedelic drug]] and [[entheogen]] of the [[phenethylamine]] class of compounds. Escaline was first synthesized and reported in the scientific literature by Benington, et al., in 1954, but was later re-examined in the laboratory of [[David E. Nichols]], who prepared a series of [[mescaline]] analogues that included escaline, [[proscaline]], and [[isoproscaline]].  The effects of this and related [[mescaline]] analogues in humans were first described by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', Shulgin lists the dosage range as 40 to 60&nbsp;mg, consumed orally.  The duration of action was stated to be 8â€“12 hours.
