IFNγ, or type II interferon, is a cytokine that is critical for [[innate immunity|innate]] and [[adaptive immunity]] against viral, some bacterial and protozoal infections. IFNγ is an important activator of macrophages and inducer of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression. Aberrant IFNγ expression is associated with a number of autoinflammatory and [[autoimmune]] diseases. The importance of IFNγ in the immune system stems in part from its ability to inhibit viral replication directly, and most importantly from its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. IFNγ is produced predominantly by natural killer ([[natural killer cell|NK]]) and natural killer T ([[Natural Killer T cell|NKT]]) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by [[CD4]] Th1 and [[CD8]] cytotoxic T lymphocyte ([[Cytotoxic T cell|CTL]]) effector T cells once [[antigen]]-specific immunity develops.<ref name="entrez2">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: INFG | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3458 | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="pmid17981204">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schoenborn JR, Wilson CB | title = Regulation of interferon-gamma during innate and adaptive immune responses | journal = Adv.
