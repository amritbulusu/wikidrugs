However, pravadoline was found to exhibit unexpectedly strong analgesic effects, which appeared at doses ten times smaller than the effective anti-inflammatory dose and so could not be explained by its action as a [[COX inhibitor]]. These effects were not blocked by opioid [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] such as [[naloxone]],<ref name="pmid2243340">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Haubrich DR, etal |title=Pharmacology of pravadoline: a new analgesic agent |journal=J.
