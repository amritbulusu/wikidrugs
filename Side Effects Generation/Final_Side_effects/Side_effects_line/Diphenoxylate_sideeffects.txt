The diphenoxylate/loperamide subfamily of gastrointestinal drugs works directly on opioid receptors, which can be found in the intestine, brain, and spinal cord. Diphenoxylate itself crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]]. This being the case, this medication is potentially habit-forming and can generate significant tolerance if taken continuously for a protracted period. Physical dependence is most common particularly with high doses and/or long-term use. The CNS penetration of diphenoxylate makes it an agent that can cause [[euphoria]] and other psychoactive effects, which could over time lead to habituation and dependency on the drug in the user.  As with other medicinal opioids, [[iatrogenic]] addiction is uncommon although physical dependence secondary to treatment of a functional bowel disorder with diphenoxylate for more than 45–90 days may very well occur; it typically requires the use of high doses to impart a morbid seek orientation for the drug in the user.  Because of this, diphenoxylate is manufactured and marketed as a combination drug with [[atropine]] ([[Lomotil]], [[Pfizer]]) as an abuse deterrent. Lomotil was used during the [[Apollo program]], as was pethidine.<ref>[http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/S2ch1.htm W. Royce Hawkins, M.D., John F.
