It has been linked to health problems such as [[Parkinson's]], [[breast cancer]], and immune, reproductive, and nervous system damage. It is also an [[endocrine disruptor]], acting as an [[estrogen]] and [[antiandrogen]], and can adversely affect testicular descent in the [[fetus]] if a pregnant woman is exposed to it.<ref name="Raun AndersenVinggaard2002">{{cite journal|last1=Raun Andersen|first1=Helle|last2=Vinggaard|first2=Anne Marie|last3=Høj Rasmussen|first3=Thomas|last4=Gjermandsen|first4=Irene Marianne|last5=Cecilie Bonefeld-Jørgensen|first5=Eva|title=Effects of Currently Used Pesticides in Assays for Estrogenicity, Androgenicity, and Aromatase Activity in Vitro|journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology|volume=179|issue=1|year=2002|pages=1–12|issn=0041-008X|doi=10.1006/taap.2001.9347}}</ref>

 
Organochlorines and other chemicals were originally developed in the 1930s for use as insecticides and pesticides. DDT became famous worldwide in 1939 after its use in overcoming a typhus infestation in Naples. The use of organochlorines increased during the 1950s and peaked in the 1970s. Their use in Australia was dramatically lowered between the mid 1970s and the early 1980s. The first restrictions on the use of dieldrin and related chemicals in Australia were introduced in 1961-2, with registration required for their use on produce animals, such as cattle and chickens. This coincided with increasing concerns worldwide about the long-term effects of persistent pesticides. The publication of ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (an account of the environmental and health effects of pesticides) by [[Rachel Carson]] in 1962 was a key driving force in raising this concern. The phase-out process was driven by government bans and deregistration, in turn promoted by changing public perceptions that food containing residues of these chemicals was less acceptable and possibly hazardous to health.
