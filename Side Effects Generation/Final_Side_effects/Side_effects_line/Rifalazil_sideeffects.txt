Of the most common are [[Chlamydia infection|''Chlamydia'' infection]], [[Clostridium difficile colitis|''Clostridium difficile'' associated diarrhea]] (CDAD), and [[tuberculosis]] (TB). Using rifalazil and the effects that coincide with taking rifalazil for treating a bacterial disease vary from person to person, as does any drug put into the human body.  Food interactions and genetic variation are a few causes for the variation in side effects from the use of rifalazil.<ref>http://www.healthanddna.com/drug-safety-dna-testing/rifalazil-side-effects</ref> Its development was terminated in 2013 due to severe side effects.<ref>{{cite web|title=AdisInsight: Rifalazil (ABI 1648; KRM 1648; PA 1648)|url=http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800006128|website=Adis Insight|publisher=Springer International Publishing AG|accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>

 
Rifalazil has been developed to treat cases of [[tuberculosis]] and [[chlamydia (bacterium)|chlamydia]]. It is very good treatment for tuberculosis because rifalazil achieves very high concentration in the blood cells and the lungs. In addition, rifalazil is becoming more widely used because it can be used along with many other indications, such as [[HIV]], TB, and [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]].<ref>http://www.activbioticspharma.com/rifalazil.html</ref> Rifalazil has a very long [[half-life]] which is very useful for certain medications. The drug is administered orally which is also convenient in terms of drug administration. A longer half-life allows for few treatments and dosage which makes this an up-and-coming drug for tuberculosis, CDAD, and chlamydia. Although the uses for rifalazil seem very effective, there are negative side effects which make the use limited. Rifalazil interacts with other drugs and on top of that, rapid resistance develops to other drugs.{{mcn|date=January 2016}}
