In 1987, Bartolini and colleagues reported progabide's actions on dopamine to be contradictory, decreasing dopamine release, dopamine receptor density and postsynaptic receptor responsivity to dopamine while reducing striatal cholinergic activity so as to increase dopaminergic effects.<ref name="Bartholini_et_al_1987">Bartholini G, Scatton B, Zivkovic B, Lloyd KG.

In addition to being tested for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia, progabide was itself tested as an antipsychotic; as early as 1979, it was obvious that it was ineffective for [[psychosis]].<ref name=Bartholini_1979>{{cite journal | first = G. | last = Bartholini | year = 1979 | title = [Potential therapeutic activity of GABA-mimetic drugs in neuropsychiatry] | journal = Schweizer Archiv für Neurologie, Neurochirurgie und Psychiatrie = Archives suisses de neurologie, neurochirurgie et de psychiatrie | volume = 125 | issue = 2 | pages = 265–9 | pmid = 45343 }} (French)</ref> While progabide may have been devoid of antipsychotic effects, it did have the effect in schizoaffective and hebephrenic patients of improving environmental responsiveness and social interactions.<ref name=Lloyd_et_al_1983>{{cite journal | author = Lloyd KG |author2=Morselli PL |author3=Depoortere H |author4=Fournier V |author5=Zivkovic B |author6=Scatton B |author7=Broekkamp C |author8=Worms P |author9=Bartholini G.   |date=June 1983 | title = The potential use of GABA agonists in psychiatric disorders: evidence from studies with progabide in animal models and clinical trials | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 957–66 | pmid = 6351106 | doi = 10.1016/S0091-3057(83)80021-5}}</ref>
