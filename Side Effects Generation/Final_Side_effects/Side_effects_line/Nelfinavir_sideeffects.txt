Common (>1%) side effects include [[insulin resistance]], [[hyperglycemia]] and [[lipodystrophy]].<ref name=Shim2014/>

 
Nelfinavir can produce a range of adverse side effects. Flatulence, [[diarrhea]] or abdominal pain are common (i.e. experienced by more than one in one hundred patients). Fatigue, urination, [[rash]], [[mouth ulcer]]s or [[hepatitis]] are less frequent effects (experienced by one in one thousand to one in one hundred patients). [[Nephrolithiasis]], [[arthralgia]], [[leukopenia]], [[pancreatitis]] or [[allergy|allergic]] reactions may occur, but are rare (less than one in one thousand patients) .

 
Since 2009, nelfinavir has been under investigation for potential use as an anti-cancer agent.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chow WA, Jiang C, Guan M |title= Anti-HIV drugs for cancer therapeutics: back to the future? |journal= Lancet Oncol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=61–71 |year=2009 |pmid=19111246 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70334-6}}</ref> When applied to cancer cells in culture ([[in vitro]]), it can inhibit the growth of a variety of cancer types and can trigger cell death ([[apoptosis]]).<ref name="pmid17785575">{{cite journal | last1 = Gills | first1 = JJ | last2 = Lopiccolo | first2 = J | last3 = Tsurutani | first3 = J | last4 = Shoemaker | first4 = RH | last5 = Best | first5 = CJM | last6 = Abu-Asab | first6 = MS | last7 = Borojerdi | first7 = J | last8 = Warfel | first8 = NA | last9 = Gardner | first9 = ER | last10 = Danish | first10 = M. | last11 = Hollander | first11 = M.
