Originally believed to exert its effects predominantly via [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|monoamine oxidase inhibition]], alpha-ethyltryptamine was [[drug development|developed]] during the 1960s as an [[antidepressant]] by [[Upjohn|Upjohn chemical company]] in the [[United States]] under the name '''Monase''', but was withdrawn from potential commercial use due to incidence of [[idiosyncratic drug reaction|idiosyncratic]] [[agranulocytosis]].<ref name="tihkalbook"/>

 
αET is [[chemical structure|structurally]] and [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] related to αMT, [[alpha-Methyltryptamine|α-methyltryptamine]], and it is believed<ref name="tihkalbook"/> its central stimulant activity is probably not due to its activity as an [[MAOI]], but appears to stem from its structural relationship to the [[indole|indolic]] psychedelics. In contrast to αMT, αET is less [[stimulant|stimulating]] and [[psychedelic drug|hallucinogenic]], its effects resembling more those of [[entactogen]]s like [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] ("Ecstasy").
