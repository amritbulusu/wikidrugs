Research suggests that the majority of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are coupled through G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins. Upon activation, CB<sub>1</sub> receptor exhibits its effects mainly through activation of [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub>]], which decreases intracellular cAMP concentration by inhibiting its production [[enzyme]], [[adenylate cyclase]], and increases [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAP kinase) concentration. Alternatively, in some rare cases CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activation may be coupled to [[Gs alpha subunit|G<sub>s</sub>]] proteins, which stimulate [[adenylate cyclase]].<ref name="pmid16570099" /> cAMP is known to serve as a second messenger coupled to a variety of ion channels, including the positively influenced [[Inward-rectifier potassium ion channel|inwardly rectifying potassium channels]] (=Kir or IRK),<ref name="pmid16109430">{{cite journal | vauthors = Demuth DG, Molleman A | title = Cannabinoid signalling | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–63 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16109430 | doi = 10.1016/j.lfs.2005.05.055 }}</ref> and [[calcium channel]]s, which are activated by cAMP-dependent interaction with such molecules as [[protein kinase A]] (PKA), [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), [[C-Raf|Raf-1]], [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]], [[JNK]], [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38]], [[c-fos]], [[c-jun]], and others.<ref name="endocrino" /> In terms of function, the inhibition of intracellular cAMP expression shortens the duration of pre-synaptic action potentials by  prolonging the rectifying potassium A-type currents, which is normally inactivated upon phosphorylation by PKA. This inhibition grows more pronounced when considered with the effect of activated CB<sub>1</sub> receptors to limit calcium entry into the cell, which does not occur through cAMP but by a direct G-protein-mediated inhibition. As presynaptic calcium entry is a requirement for vesicle release, this function will decrease the transmitter that enters the synapse upon release.<ref name="pmid11316486">{{cite journal | vauthors = Elphick MR, Egertová M | title = The neurobiology and evolution of cannabinoid signalling | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are expressed most densely in the central nervous system and are largely responsible for mediating the effects of cannabinoid binding in the brain.  Endocannabinoids released by a depolarized neuron bind to CB<sub>1</sub> receptors on pre-synaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, resulting in a respective decrease in either glutamate or GABA release. Limiting glutamate release causes reduced excitation, while limiting GABA release suppresses inhibition, a common form of short-term [[synaptic plasticity|plasticity]] in which the depolarization of a single neuron induces a reduction in [[GABA]]-mediated inhibition, in effect exciting the postsynaptic cell.<ref name="pmid11316486" />

 
CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are expressed throughout the [[basal ganglia]] and have well-established effects on movement in rodents. As in the hippocampus, these receptors inhibit the release of glutamate or GABA transmitter, resulting in decreased excitation or reduced inhibition based on the cell they are expressed in. Consistent with the variable expression of both excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA interneurons in both the basal ganglia's direct and indirect motor loops, synthetic cannabinoids are known to influence this system in a dose-dependent triphasic pattern. Decreased locomotor activity is seen at both higher and lower concentrations of applied cannabinoids, whereas an enhancement of movement may occur upon moderate dosages.<ref name="pmid11316486" />  However, these dose-dependent effects have been studied predominately in rodents, and the physiological basis for this triphasic pattern warrants future research in humans. Effects may vary based on the site of cannabinoid application, input from higher cortical centers, and whether drug application is unilateral or bilateral.

 
Many of the documented analgesic effects of cannabinoids are based on the interaction of these compounds with CB<sub>1</sub> receptors on [[spinal cord]] interneurons in the superficial levels of the [[Posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]], known for its role in nociceptive processing. In particular, the CB<sub>1</sub> is heavily expressed in layers 1 and 2 of the spinal cord dorsal horn and in lamina 10 by the central canal. Dorsal root ganglion also express these receptors, which target a variety of peripheral terminals involved in nociception. Signals on this track are also transmitted to the [[periaqueductal gray]] (PAG) of the midbrain. Endogenous cannabinoids are believed to exhibit an analgesic effect on these receptors by limiting both GABA and glutamate of PAG cells that relate to nociceptive input processing, a hypothesis consistent with the finding that anandamide release in the PAG is increased in response to pain-triggering stimuli.<ref name="pmid11316486" />

 
Enhanced receptor expression following disease has been found to result in a leftward shift in the log dose-response curve of cannabinol, and also an increase in the size of its maximal effects.<ref name="pmid17828291" />

 
A CB<sub>1</sub> receptor knock-out mouse study examined the effect that these receptors play on exploratory behavior in novel situations. Researchers selectively targeted glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical interneurons and studied results in open field, novel object, and sociability tests. Eliminating glutamatergic cannabinoid receptors led to decreased object exploration, social interactions, and increased aggressive behavior. In contrast, GABAergic cannabinoid receptor-knockout mice showed increased exploration of objects, socialization, and open field movement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Häring M, Kaiser N, Monory K, Lutz B | title = Circuit specific functions of cannabinoid CB1 receptor in the balance of investigatory drive and exploration | journal = PloS One | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = e26617 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22069458 | pmc = 3206034 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0026617 | editor1-last = Burgess | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...626617H | editor1-first = Harold A. }}</ref> These opposing effects reveal the importance of the endocannabinoid system in regulating anxiety-dependent behavior. Glutamatergic CB<sub>1</sub>receptors not only are responsible for mediating aggression but produce anxiolytic-like function by inhibiting excessive arousal, which prevented the mice from exploring both animate and inanimate objects. In contrast, GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub> receptors appear to control an anxiogenic-like function by limiting inhibitory transmitter release. Taken together, these results illustrate the regulatory function of the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor on the organism's overall sense of arousal during novel situations and suggest that investigatory drive is associated with impulsive behavior.

 
Another study found that differential synthesis of anandamide and 2-AG in response to stress mediated beneficial effects of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]]. These effects were eliminated by the application of the CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist [[AM251]], illustrating that this receptor is essential for modulating the function of the stress response.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill MN, McLaughlin RJ, Bingham B, Shrestha L, Lee TT, Gray JM, Hillard CJ, Gorzalka BB, Viau V | title = Endogenous cannabinoid signaling is essential for stress adaptation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 20 | pages = 9406–11 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20439721 | pmc = 2889099 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0914661107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.9406H }}</ref>

 
Inhibition of [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] activity has been observed after administration of [[THC]] or [[anandamide]]. This effect is assumed to be CB<sub>1</sub>-mediated, since this receptor is expressed by the [[peptide hormone]] [[cholecystokinin]], and application of the CB<sub>1</sub>-specific inverse agonist SR 141716A ([[Rimonabant]]) blocks the effect. Another report, however, suggests that inhibition of [[intestine|intestinal]] [[motility]] may also have a [[Cannabinoid receptor 2 (macrophage)|CB<sub>2</sub>]]-mediated component.<ref name="pmid15249429">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathison R, Ho W, Pittman QJ, Davison JS, Sharkey KA | title = Effects of cannabinoid receptor-2 activation on accelerated gastrointestinal transit in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 142 | issue = 8 | pages = 1247–54 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15249429 | pmc = 1575196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0705889 }}</ref>

 
The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor [[inverse agonist]] [[rimonabant]] has been found to reduce intake of food or sweet solutions in both humans and mice. Targeting this receptor with rimonabant has been found to prevent the THC-induced enhancement of DA release in the [[nucleus accumbens]] shell from food, suggesting that these receptors may be involved in determining the hedonic value of food.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = De Luca MA, Solinas M, Bimpisidis Z, Goldberg SR, Di Chiara G | title = Cannabinoid facilitation of behavioral and biochemical hedonic taste responses | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22063718 | pmc = 3705914 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.10.018 }}</ref> In addition, CB1 facilitates [[ghrelin]] release, normally happening when the stomach is constricted In the presence of a relatively active system, overeating is promoted.

Results found that both short- and long-term effects were dependent on CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activation in the striatum, whereas LTD induction in the BNST relied on [[TRPV1]] receptor. Effects vary based on the endocannabinoid molecule: 2-AG was found to act on presynaptic CB<sub>1</sub> receptors to mediate retrograde [[short-term depression]] following activation of L-type calcium currents, whereas anandamide was synthesized after mGluR5 activation and triggered [[autocrine signalling]] that induced [[long-term depression]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Puente N, Cui Y, Lassalle O, Lafourcade M, Georges F, Venance L, Grandes P, Manzoni OJ | title = Polymodal activation of the endocannabinoid system in the extended amygdala | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 12 | pages = 1542–7 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22057189 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2974 }}</ref>  These findings demonstrate the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor as a direct mechanism for the brain to selectively inhibit neuronal excitability over variable time scales. By selectively internalizing different receptors, the brain may limit the production of specific endocannabinoids to favor a time scale in accordance with its needs. mGlu5 forms a heterodimer with A2A, which allows endocannabinoids to regulate their own levels, as they inhibit cAMP production, thus increase free adenosine to agonise A2A. This forms a feedback loop between the positive and negative metabotropic receptors, which can maintain a relatively similar homeostasis with any neuron connected through an electrical synapse.

 
The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is expressed by a number of neurons that project from the [[anterior olfactory nucleus]] to the [[ipsilateral]] main [[olfactory bulb]]. However, the effects of cannabinoids on synaptic activity in these neurons has not been well-studied and its effects on olfaction warrant further research in rodents.<ref name="pmid11316486" /> Cannabinoids are not known to have effects on olfaction in humans. However, as with the rest of the brain, it plays a crucial role in modulation of NT release.

 
Selective CB<sub>1</sub> agonists may be used to isolate the effects of the receptor from the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor, as most cannabinoids and endocannabinoids bind to both receptor types.<ref name="pmid11316486" />
