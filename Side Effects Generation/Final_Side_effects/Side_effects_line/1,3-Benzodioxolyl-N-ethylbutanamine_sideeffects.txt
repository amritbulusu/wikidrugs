EBDB was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', the minimum dosage consumed was 90 [[milligram|mg]], and the duration is unknown.<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal077.shtml Ethyl-J Entry in ''PiHKAL'']</ref> EBDB produced few to no effects at the dosage range tested in PiHKAL, but at higher doses of several hundred milligrams it produces euphoric effects similar to those of [[methylbenzodioxylbutanamine]] (MBDB; "Eden", "Methyl-J"), although milder and shorter lasting.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
