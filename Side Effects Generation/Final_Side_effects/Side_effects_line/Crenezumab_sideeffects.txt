ABBY was a [[Clinical trial phase|phase II study]] that evaluated the effects of crenezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease, which concluded in 2014. The primary endpoints were reduction in cognitive decline and global function decline.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2014-07-16.htm|title=Roche announces phase II clinical results of crenezumab in Alzheimer’s disease|website=www.roche.com|access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref> Patients treated with high-dose intravenous crenuzumab showed non-significant reductions in both cognitive decline and global function decline, while patients who received subcutaneous crenezumab did not improve on either measure. Exploratory analysis of patients with the mildest symptoms (as defined by a [[Mini mental state examination|Mini Mental State Examination]] score of 22-26) who received high-dose intravenous crenezumab did show a significant reduction in cognitive decline, but not in global function decline.<ref name=":1" />

 
BLAZE was a [[Phases of clinical research|phase II study]] that also concluded in 2014 and evaluated the effects of crenezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease, however its primary endpoint was changes in brain amyloid load, with secondary endpoints of changes in other biomarkers, cognition, global function, and activities of daily living. The resultant data showed no significant difference between either high-dose intravenous or subcutaneous crenezumab and placebo.<ref name=":1" />

 
In July 2015, Genentech announced it was moving crenezumab into a [[Phases of clinical research|phase III study]], known as CREAD, to evaluate the effects of crenezumab in patients with prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer's Disease. This study aims to enroll 750 individuals between the ages of 50 and 85 at 233 international sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hugin.info/171580/R/1973540/721979.pdf|title=AC Immune receives milestone payment for crenezumab moving into phase III clinical development in Alzheimer’s disease|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=15 Nov 2016}}</ref> The primary outcome measure for this trial is change in [[Clinical Dementia Rating|clinical dementia rating]], with secondary outcomes of changes in cognition, quality of life, and time to clinically evident decline, among others.
