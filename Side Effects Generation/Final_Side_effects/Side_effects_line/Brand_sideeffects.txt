[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by assessing the effectiveness of these branding components.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin Lane|date=1993-01-01|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|jstor=1252054|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.2307/1252054}}</ref> As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is a marketing technique to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.<ref name=":0"/> A brand is in essence a promise to its customers of they can expect from their products, as well as emotional benefits.<ref name=":0"/> When a customer is familiar with a brand, or favours it incomparably to its competitors, this is when a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.<ref name=":1"/>

 
'''Brand recognition''' is the initial phase of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.<ref name=":5" /> When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.<ref name=":1" /> For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from.
