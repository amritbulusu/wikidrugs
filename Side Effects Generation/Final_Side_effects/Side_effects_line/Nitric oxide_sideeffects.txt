As seen in the Acid deposition section, nitric oxide can transform into nitrogen dioxide (this can happen with the hydroperoxy radical, HO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>, or diatomic oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>). Symptoms of short-term nitrogen dioxide exposure include nausea, [[dyspnea]] and headache. Long-term effects could include impaired immune and [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] function.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0930.html|title = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=1 July 2014 |accessdate = 10 December 2015|website =NIOSH |publisher = }}</ref>

 
The production of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by aiding in pulmonary vasculature [[vasodilation]]. Effects include vasodilatation, [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmission]] (see [[gasotransmitters]]), modulation of the [[Human hair growth|hair cycle]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.drproctor.com/Archd.htm |title=Endothelium-Derived Relaxing Factor and Minoxidil: Active Mechanisms in Hair Growth

In the United States, ongoing direct use of nitric oxide use is only approved for [[neonates]]. In the adult ICU setting, inhaled ·NO can improve hypoxemia in [[acute lung injury]], [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], and severe [[pulmonary hypertension]], although the effects are short-lived and there are no studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes. It is used on an individualized basis in ICUs as an adjunct to other definitive therapies for reversible causes of hypoxemic respiratory distress.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Mark J.D.
