[[Phencyclidine]] (PCP) is believed to be the first arylcyclohexylamine with recognized anesthetic properties, but several arylcyclohexylamines were described before PCP in the scientific literature, beginning with PCA (1-phenylcyclohexan-1-amine) the synthesis of which was first published in 1907. [[Eticyclidine|PCE]] was reported in 1953 and PCMo in 1954, with the latter compound described as a potent sedative.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal|first1=H.|last1=Morris|first2=J.|last2=Wallach|title=From PCP to MXE: a comprehensive review of the non-medical use of dissociative drugs|journal=Drug Testing and Analysis|year=2014|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1620/abstract|doi=10.1002/dta.1620|pmid=24678061|volume=6|issue=7–8|pages=614–32}}</ref> Arylcyclohexylamines anesthetics were intensively investigated at [[Parke-Davis]], beginning with the 1956 synthesis of [[phencyclidine]] and later the related compound [[ketamine]].<ref name="Morris"/> The 1970s saw the debut of these compounds, especially PCP and its [[structural analog|analogues]], as illicitly used [[recreational drugs]] due to their [[dissociative]] [[hallucinogen]]ic and [[euphoriant]] effects. Since, the class has been expanded by [[scientific research]] into [[stimulant]], [[analgesic]], and [[neuroprotective]] agents, and also by [[:wikt:clandestine|clandestine]] [[chemist]]s in search of novel [[recreational drug]]s.

 
}}</ref> actions have been reported for some of these agents. Antagonism of the NMDA receptor confers anesthetic, anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, and dissociative effects; blockade of the [[dopamine transporter]] mediates stimulant and euphoriant effects as well as [[psychosis]] in high amounts; and activation of the μ-opioid receptor causes analgesic and euphoriant effects. Stimulation of the σ and D<sub>2</sub> receptors may also contribute to hallucinogenic and psychomimetic effects.<ref name="pmid15852061"/>
