It is related in structure to the [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[tryptamine]] derivative [[5-MeO-DiPT]], but with the [[indole]] [[bioisostere|nitrogen replaced by oxygen]], making 5-MeO-DiBF a [[benzofuran]] derivative. It is several times less potent as a serotonin agonist than 5-MeO-DiPT and with relatively more activity at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, but still shows strongest effects at the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> family of receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm00089a017 | title=Benzofuran bioisosteres of hallucinogenic tryptamines | author=Zbigniew Tomaszewski  | author2=Michael P.
