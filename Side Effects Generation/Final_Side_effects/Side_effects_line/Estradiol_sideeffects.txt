'''Estradiol''' ('''E2'''), also spelled '''oestradiol''', is a [[steroid]], an [[estrogen]], and the primary [[female]] [[sex hormone]]. It is named for and is important in the regulation of the [[estrous cycle|estrous]] and [[menstrual cycle|menstrual]] female [[reproductive cycle]]s. Estradiol is essential for the development and maintenance of female [[reproductive organ|reproductive tissue]]s such as the [[breast]]s, [[uterus]], and [[vagina]] during [[puberty]], [[adulthood]], and [[pregnancy]],<ref name="pmid7083198">{{cite journal | author = Ryan KJ | title = Biochemistry of aromatase: significance to female reproductive physiology | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 42 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 3342s–3344s | date = August 1982 | pmid = 7083198 | url = }}</ref> but it also has important effects in many other [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, including [[bone]], [[fat]], [[skin]], [[liver]], and the [[brain]].

Estrogen is considered to play a significant role in women’s mental health, with links suggested between the hormone level, mood and well-being. Sudden drops or fluctuations in, or long periods of sustained low levels of estrogen may be correlated with significant mood-lowering. Clinical recovery from depression postpartum, perimenopause, and postmenopause was shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Douma SL, Husband C, O'Donnell ME, Barwin BN, Woodend AK | title = Estrogen-related mood disorders: reproductive life cycle factors | journal = Adv Nurs Sci | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 364–75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16292022 | doi = 10.1097/00012272-200510000-00008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lasiuk GC, Hegadoren KM | title = The effects of estradiol on central serotonergic systems and its relationship to mood in women | journal = Biol Res Nurs | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–60 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17909167 | doi = 10.1177/1099800407305600 }}</ref>

 
Estradiol has complex effects on the [[liver]]. It affects the production of multiple [[protein]]s, including [[lipoprotein]]s, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for [[blood clotting]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In high amounts, estradiol can lead to [[cholestasis]], for instance [[intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy|cholestasis of pregnancy]].

 
Estradiol acts primarily as an [[agonist]] of the [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), a [[nuclear receptor|nuclear]] [[steroid hormone receptor]]. There are two subtypes of the ER, [[estrogen receptor alpha|ERα]] and [[estrogen receptor beta|ERβ]], and estradiol potently binds to and activates both of these receptors. The result of ER activation is a modulation of [[gene transcription]] and [[gene expression|expression]] in ER-expressing [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, which is the predominant mechanism by which estradiol mediates its biological effects in the body. Estradiol also acts as an agonist of [[membrane estrogen receptor]]s (mERs), such as [[GPER]] (GPR30), a recently discovered non-nuclear receptor for estradiol, via which it can mediate a variety of rapid, non-[[genomic]] effects.<ref name="pmid24530924">{{cite journal |vauthors=Prossnitz ER, Barton M | title = Estrogen biology: New insights into GPER function and clinical opportunities | journal = Mol.

Thus, consumption may have oestrogenic effects. In light of this, consumption can be counterproductive to patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer, which usually includes depriving the cancer cells of estrogens.
