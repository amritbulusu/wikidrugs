Propiram exhibits weak opioid antagonist activity on the mu receptor—quite a bit weaker than its agonist effects—and the effect on kappa and delta opioid, sigma receptors, or the [[NMDA]] system are not well understood. Other drugs of the partial mu-opioid agonist/antagonist type include [[meptazinol]], [[buprenorphine]], [[butorphanol]], [[phenazocine]], [[nalbuphine]], [[pentazocine]], [[dezocine]] and its relatives.

 
With about 10% of the analgesic potency of [[morphine]], 50&nbsp;mg of propiram is equivalent to about 60&nbsp;mg of codeine or 50&nbsp;mg of pentazocine. In many patients, propiram is an effective analgesic comparable to other drugs such as these as well as [[pethidine]], with a normal dose of around 50–100&nbsp;mg and a duration of action of 3 to 6 hours.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7165237| year = 1982| author1 = Wilson| first1 = R.
