'''Dizocilpine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''MK-801''', is an uncompetitive [[NMDA receptor antagonist|antagonist of the ''N''-Methyl-<small>D</small>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor]], a [[glutamate receptor]], discovered by a team at Merck in 1982.<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | status = Patent | number = 4399141 | title = 5-Alkyl or hydroxyalkyl substituted-10,11-imines & Anticonvulsant Use Thereof | gdate = 1983-08-16 | inventor = ANDERSON, P.; CHRISTY, M.

It also inhibited the induction of [[long term potentiation]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Coan EJ, Saywood W, Collingridge GL |title=MK-801 blocks NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and long term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices |journal=Neurosci.

While ketamine may also trigger temporary [[psychosis]] in certain individuals, its short half-life and lower potency make it a much safer clinical option.  However, dizocilpine is the most frequently used non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist in animal models to mimic psychosis for experimental purposes.

 
The effects of dizocilpine at NMDA receptors are clear and significant. NMDA receptors are key in the progression of [[excitotoxicity]] (a process in which an excessive amount of extracellular [[glutamate]] overexcites [[glutamate receptor]]s and harms neurons).  Thus NMDA receptor antagonists including dizocilpine have been extensively studied for use in treatment of diseases with excitotoxic components, such as [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], and [[neurodegenerative disease]]s such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's]], [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]], and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. Dizocilpine has shown effectiveness in protecting neurons in [[cell culture]] and [[animal experimentation|animal models]] of excitotoxic neurodegeneration.<ref name="Ayala">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayala GX, Tapia R |title=Late N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade rescues hippocampal neurons from excitotoxic stress and death after 4-aminopyridine-induced epilepsy |journal=Eur.

Behavioural studies have shown that NMDA receptors are involved in the development of psychological dependence caused by chronic administration of morphine. Dizocilpine suppressed the morphine-induced rewarding effect. It is suggested that stimulating NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor and its associated kinases in the nucleus accumbens leads to the rewarding effect caused by morphine. Inhibition of this receptor and its kinases in the nucleus accumbens by co-treatment with NMDA antagonists prevents morphine-associated psychological dependence.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Narita M, Kato H, Miyoshi K, Aoki T, Yajima Y, Suzuki T |title=Treatment for psychological dependence on morphine: usefulness of inhibiting NMDA receptor and its associated protein kinase in the nucleus accumbens |journal=Life Sci. |volume=77 |issue=18 |pages=2207–20 |date=September 2005 |pmid=15946694 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2005.04.015 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0024-3205(05)00443-1}}</ref> An earlier study has shown that the prevention of morphine-associated psychological dependence was not due to state-dependency effects induced by dizocilpine<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tzschentke TM, Schmidt WJ |title=Interactions of MK-801 and GYKI 52466 with morphine and amphetamine in place preference conditioning and behavioural sensitization |journal=Behav.

Dizocilpine may be effective as a recreational drug. Little is known in this context about its effects, dosage, and risks. The high potency of dizocilpine makes its dosage more difficult to accurately control when compared to other similar drugs. As a result, the chances of [[overdosing]] are high. Users tend to report that the experience is not as enjoyable as other dissociative drugs, and it is often accompanied by strong auditory hallucinations. Also, dizocilpine is much longer-lasting than similar dissociative drugs such as [[ketamine]] and [[phencyclidine]] (PCP), and causes far worse [[amnesia]] and residual deficits in thinking, which have hindered its acceptance as a recreational drug.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

 
Several animal studies have demonstrated the addictive potential of dizocilpine. Rats learned to lever-press in order to obtain injections of dizocilpine into the nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex, however, when given a dopamine antagonist at the same time, the lever-pressing was not altered, which shows that the rewarding effect of dizocilpine is not dependent on dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carlezon WA, Wise RA |title=Rewarding actions of phencyclidine and related drugs in nucleus accumbens shell and frontal cortex |journal=J.
