'''Penfluridol''' ('''Semap''', '''Micefal''', '''Longoperidol''') is a highly potent, first generation [[diphenylbutylpiperidine]] [[antipsychotic]]. It was discovered at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1968. Related to other diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotics, [[pimozide]] and [[fluspirilene]], penfluridol has an extremely long elimination half-life and its effects last for many days after single oral dose. Its antipsychotic potency, in terms of dose needed to produce comparable effects, is similar to both [[haloperidol]] and pimozide. It is only slightly [[sedative]], but often causes [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side-effects, such as [[akathisia]], [[dyskinesia]]e and pseudo-[[Parkinsonism]]. Penfluridol is indicated for antipsychotic treatment of chronic [[schizophrenia]] and similar [[psychosis|psychotic disorders]], it is, however, like most typical antipsychotics, being increasingly replaced by the [[atypical antipsychotics]]. Due to its extremely long-lasting effects, it is often prescribed to be taken orally as tablets only once a week (q 7 days). The once-weekly dose is usually 10â€“60&nbsp;mg. A 2006 [[systematic review]] examined the use of penfluridol for people with schizophrenia:

 
|Although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. The [[Efficacy|effectiveness]] and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical [[Antipsychotic|antipsychotic]]s; both oral and depot. Furthermore, penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. One of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. It is also an option for people with long-term schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of [[Antipsychotic|antipsychotic]] medication. An additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low-cost intervention.<ref name=Soa2006/>
