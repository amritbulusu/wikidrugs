Dronedarone has been termed a “multichannel blocker” however it is unclear which channel(s) play a pivotal role in its success.<ref name="Guillemare">Guillemare E, Marion A, Nisato D, Gautier P, “Inhibitory effects of dronedarone on muscarinic K+ current in guinea pig atrial cells,” in Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, 2000 7</ref> Thus, dronedarone's actions at the cellular level are controversial with most studies suggesting an inhibition in multiple outward potassium currents including rapid delayed rectifier, slow delayed rectifier and ACh-activated inward rectifier.<ref name="Aimond">Aimond F, Beck L, Gautier P, Chérif OK, Davy JM, Lorente P, Nisato D, Vassort G, “Cellular and in vivo electrophysiological effects of dronedarone in normal and postmyocardial infarcted rats,” in The Journal of Pharmacology and experimental therapeutics, 2000. 11</ref> It is also believed to reduce inward rapid Na current and L-type Ca channels. The reduction in K current in some studies was shown to be due to the inhibition of K-ACh channel or associated GTP-binding proteins.<ref name="Guillemare" /> Reduction of K+ current by 69% led to increased AP duration and increased effective refractory periods, thus shown to suppress [[pacemaker]] potential of the SA node and return patients to a normal heart rhythm.<ref name="Aimond" /> In a European trial, the average time to recurrence of an arrhythmia was 41 days in the placebo group vs. 96 days in the dronedarone group (similar results obtained in the non-European trial, 59 and 158 days respectively).<ref>Singh BN, Connolly SJ, Crijns HJ, Roy D, Kowey PR, Capucci A, Radzik D, Aliot EM, Hohnloser SH; EURIDIS and ADONIS Investigators, “Dronedarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation or flutter,” in The New England Journal of Medicine, 2007. 12</ref>

 
Chemically, dronedarone is a [[benzofuran]] derivative related to [[amiodarone]], a popular [[Antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmic]]. The use of amiodarone is limited by toxicity due its high [[iodine]] content ([[pulmonary fibrosis]], [[thyroid]] disease) as well as by [[liver]] disease. In dronedarone, the iodine moieties are not present, reducing toxic effects on the thyroid and other organs. A methylsulfonamide group is added to reduce solubility in fats (lipophobicity) and thus reduce neurotoxic effects.<ref name="Zimetbaum"/>

Clinical trials have compared dronedarone to placebo and to amiodarone, for its ability to reduce atrial fibrillation, to reduce mortality overall and from cardiac causes, and for its adverse effects, including excess mortality.<ref name="Zimetbaum"/><ref>Guillemare E, Marion A, Nisato D, Gautier P, “Inhibitory effects of dronedarone on muscarinic K+ current in guinea pig atrial cells,” in Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, 2000. 7</ref> Dronedarone is a non-iodinated [[Class III antiarrhythmic|class III anti-arrhythmic drug]] which helps patients return to normal [[sinus rhythm]].
