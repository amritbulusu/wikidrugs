'''Org 28611''' ('''SCH-900,111''')  is a drug developed by [[Organon International]] which acts as a potent [[cannabinoid]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[full agonist]] at both the [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cannabinoid receptor 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]] receptors. It was developed with the aim of finding a [[solubility|water-soluble]] cannabinoid agonist suitable for [[intravenous]] use as an [[analgesic]],<ref>{{Cite journal |author= Adam, J.
