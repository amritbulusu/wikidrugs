Eribulin has both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic mechanisms of action.  Its cytotoxic effects are related to its antimitotic activities, wherein [[apoptosis]] of cancer cells is induced following prolonged and irreversible mitotic blockade.<ref name="pmid15313917">{{cite journal | author = Kuznetsov G, Towle MJ, Cheng H, Kawamura T, TenDyke K, Liu D, [[Kishi Y]], Yu MJ, Littlefield BA | title = Induction of morphological and biochemical apoptosis following prolonged mitotic blockage by halichondrin B macrocyclic ketone analog E7389 | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 64 | issue = 16 | pages = 5760–6 |date=August 2004 | pmid = 15313917 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1169 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid21127197">{{cite journal |vauthors=Towle MJ, Salvato KA, Wels BF, Aalfs KK, Zheng W, Seletsky BM, Zhu X, Lewis BM, Kishi Y, Yu MJ, Littlefield BA | title = Eribulin induces irreversible mitotic blockade: implications of cell-based pharmacodynamics for in vivo efficacy under intermittent dosing conditions | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 496–505 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21127197 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1874 | url =  }}</ref> In addition to its cytotoxic, antimitotic-based mechanisms, preclinical studies in human breast cancer models have shown that eribulin also exerts complex effects on the biology of surviving cancer cells and residual tumors that appear unrelated to its antimitotic effects.
