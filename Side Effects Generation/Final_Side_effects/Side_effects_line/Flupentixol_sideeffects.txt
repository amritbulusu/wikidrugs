;Common (>1% incidence) adverse effects include:

 
* Extrapyramidal side effects such as: (which ''usually'' become apparent soon after therapy is begun or soon after an increase in dose is made)

 
: and if the hyperprolactinemia persists ''chronically'', the following adverse effects may be seen:

Its antipsychotic effects are likely caused by D<sub>2</sub> and/or 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism, whereas its antidepressant effects at lower doses may be mediated by preferential D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> [[autoreceptor]] blockade, resulting in increased postsynaptic activation.
