'''Ticlopidine''' (trade name '''Ticlid''') is an antiplatelet drug in the [[thienopyridine]] family which is an [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) receptor inhibitor. Research initially showed that it was useful for preventing strokes and coronary stent occlusions. However, because of its rare but serious side effects of [[neutropenia]] and [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] it was primarily used in patients in whom aspirin was not tolerated, or in whom dual antiplatelet therapy was desirable. With the advent of newer and safer antiplatelet drugs such as [[clopidogrel]] and [[ticagrelor]], its use remained limited.

 
Ticlopidine is considered a second-line option for the prevention of thrombotic strokes among patients who have previously had a stroke or TIA. Studies have shown that it is superior to aspirin in the prevention of death or future strokes. However, it also has more frequent and serious side effects compared to aspirin, so it is reserved for those patients that cannot take aspirin.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A randomized trial comparing ticlopidine hydrochloride with aspirin for the prevention of stroke in high-risk patients.

When a patient needs to have a stent placed in one of the vessels around their heart, it is important that that stent stay open to keep blood flowing to the heart. Therefore, patients with stents must take medications after the procedure to help maintain that blood flow. Ticlopidine, taken together with aspirin, is FDA approved for this purpose, and in studies it has been shown to work better than aspirin alone or aspirin with an anticoagulant.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A randomized comparison of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy after the placement of coronary-artery stents|vauthors=Schomig L, Neumann FJ, Kastrati A |date = 1996|journal = N Engl J Med|doi = 10.1056/nejm199604253341702|pmid = 8598866|access-date = |display-authors=etal |volume=334 |pages=1084–1089}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A clinical trial comparing three antithrombotic-drug regimens after coronary-artery stenting.

Soon after its release, studies regarding ticlopidine found it had the potential to be helpful for other diseases including peripheral vascular disease,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Antiaggregatory, physiological and clinical effects of ticlopidine in subjects with peripheral atherosclerosis|vauthors=Kirstein P, Jogestrand T, Johnsson H |date = 1980|journal = Atherosclerosis|doi = 10.1016/0021-9150(80)90240-3|pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal |volume=36 |pages=471–480}}</ref> diabetic retinopathy,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ticlopidine treatment reduces the progression of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy|last = The TIMAD Study Group|date = 1990|journal = Arch Ophthalmol|doi = 10.1001/archopht.1990.01070130079035|pmid = |access-date =|volume=108|pages=1577}}</ref> and sickle cell disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Clinical and biological double-blind study of ticlopidine in preventive treatment of sickle cell disease crises|vauthors=Cabannes R, Lonsdorfer J, Castaigne JP |date = 1984|journal = Agents Actions|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal}}</ref> However none had enough evidence for FDA approval. Due to the blood cell side effects associated with ticlopidine, researchers for treatments for these conditions have turned to other avenues.

The most serious side effects associated with ticlopidine are those that affect the blood cells, although these life-threatening complications are relatively rare. The most common side effects include:<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2001/19-979S018_Ticlid_prntlbl.pdf|title = Ticlid (ticlopidine) package insert|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = |publisher = US Food & Drug Administration|last = Roche Laboratories, Inc.}}</ref>

 
Ticlopidine is a thienopyridine which, when metabolized by the body, irreversibly blocks the ADP receptor on the surface of platelets. Without ADP, fibrinogen does not bind to the platelet surface, preventing platelets from sticking to each other.<ref name=":1" /> By interfering with platelet function, ticlopidine prevents clots from forming on the inside of blood vessels.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, 12th ed.|vauthors=Katzung B, Masters S, Trevor A |publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 34: Drugs Used in Disorders of Coagulation}}</ref> Anti-platelet effects start within 2 days and reach their maximum by 6 days of therapy. Ticlopidine’s effects persist for 3 days after discontinuing ticlopidine although it may take 1–2 weeks for platelet function to return to normal, as the medication affects platelets irreversibly. Therefore, new platelets must be formed before platelet function normalizes.<ref name=":1" />

 
Ticlopidine interacts with several classes of medications. It increases the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs.<ref name=":1" /> Taking ticlopidine at the same time as antacids decreases the absorption of ticlopidine.<ref name=":1" /> Ticlopidine inhibits liver CYP2C19<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ticlopidine as selective mechanism-based inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 2C19|last = Ha-Duong NT, Dijols S, Macherey, AC|date = 2001|journal = Biochemistry|doi = 10.1021/bi010254c|pmid = |access-date =|volume=40|pages=12112–12122}}</ref> and CYP2B6<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Effect of clopidogrel and ticlopidine on cytochrome P450 2B6 activity as measured by bupropion hydroxylation|vauthors=Turpeinen M, Tolonen A, Uusitalo J |date = 2005|journal = Clin Pharmacol Ther|doi = 10.1016/j.clpt.2005.02.010|pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal |volume=77 |pages=553–559}}</ref> and thus can affect blood levels of medications metabolized by these systems.
