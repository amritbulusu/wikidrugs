'''Disulfiram''' (sold under the trade names '''Antabuse''' and '''Antabus''') is a [[medication|drug]] used to support the treatment of chronic [[alcoholism]] by producing an acute sensitivity to [[ethanol]] (drinking alcohol). Disulfiram works by [[Enzyme inhibition|inhibiting]] the [[enzyme]] [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], which means that many of the effects of a "[[hangover]]" are felt immediately after alcohol is consumed. "Disulfiram plus alcohol, even small amounts, produce flushing, throbbing in head and neck, throbbing headache, respiratory difficulty, nausea, copious vomiting, sweating, thirst, chest pain, palpitation, dyspnea, hyperventilation, tachycardia, hypotension, syncope, marked uneasiness, weakness, vertigo, blurred vision, and confusion. In severe reactions there may be respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, acute congestive heart failure, unconsciousness, convulsions, and death."<ref name=nih>{{cite web|title=Antabuse – disulifram tablet|url=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f0ca0e1f-9641-48d5-9367-e5d1069e8680|website=DailyMed|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=4 July 2016|date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>

 
Disulfiram is a [[disulfiram-like drug]]. In the body, alcohol is converted to [[acetaldehyde]], which is then broken down by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. If the dehydrogenase enzyme is inhibited, acetaldehyde builds up and causes unpleasant effects. Disulfiram should be used in conjunction with counseling and support.

 
Under normal [[metabolism]], alcohol is broken down in the [[liver]] by the [[enzyme]] [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] to [[acetaldehyde]], which is then converted by the enzyme [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] to a harmless [[acetic acid]] derivative ([[acetyl coenzyme A]]).  Disulfiram blocks this reaction at the intermediate stage by blocking acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.  After alcohol intake under the influence of disulfiram, the concentration of acetaldehyde in the blood may be five to 10 times higher than that found during metabolism of the same amount of alcohol alone.  As acetaldehyde is one of the major causes of the symptoms of a "[[hangover]]", this produces immediate and severe negative reaction to alcohol intake. Some five to 10 minutes after alcohol intake, the patient may experience the effects of a severe hangover for a period of 30 minutes up to several hours. Symptoms include [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] of the skin, accelerated heart rate, [[shortness of breath]], [[nausea]],  [[vomiting]], throbbing headache, visual disturbance, mental confusion, [[postural syncope]], and [[circulatory collapse]].

 
Disulfiram should not be taken if alcohol has been consumed in the last 12 hours.<ref name="urlDisulfiram Official FDA information, side effects and uses.">{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/disulfiram.html |title=Disulfiram Official FDA information, side effects and uses. |work= |accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> There is no tolerance to disulfiram: the longer it is taken, the stronger its effects.<ref name=nih/> As disulfiram is absorbed slowly through the digestive tract and eliminated slowly by the body, the effects may last for up to two weeks after the initial intake; consequently, [[medical ethics]] dictate that patients must be fully informed about the disulfiram-alcohol reaction.<ref name="pmid2189310">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(90)90534-K |title=Disulfiram treatment of alcoholism |year=1990 |last1=Wright |first1=Curtis |last2=Moore |first2=Richard D. |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=647–55 |pmid=2189310}}</ref>

 
==Side effects in absence of alcohol==

 
The most common side effects in the absence of alcohol are headache, and a metallic or garlic taste in the mouth, though more severe side effects may occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/disulfiram-side-effects.html|title=Disulfiram Side Effects|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref> [[Tryptophol]], a chemical compound that induces sleep in humans, is formed in the liver after disulfiram treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI109419 |title=Rapid distribution of tryptophol (3-indole ethanol) to the brain and other tissues |year=1979 |last1=Cornford |first1=E M |last2=Bocash |first2=W D |last3=Braun |first3=L D |last4=Crane |first4=P D |last5=Oldendorf |first5=W H |last6=MacInnis |first6=A J |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=1241–8 |pmid=447842 |pmc=372073}}</ref> Less common side effects include decrease in libido, liver problems, skin rash, and nerve inflammation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/brain-and-nervous-system/a6217/antabuse-disulfiram/ |title=Antabuse (disulfiram) |date=November 18, 2013 |website=netdoctor |access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref>

 
* [[Coprine]], which metabolizes to 1-aminocyclopropanol, a chemical having the same metabolic effects as disulfiram.  It occurs naturally in the otherwise edible common ink cap mushroom (''[[Coprinopsis atramentaria]]''), hence its colloquial name "tippler's bane". Similar reactions have been recorded with ''[[Clitocybe clavipes]]'' and ''[[Suillellus luridus]]'', although the agent in those species is unknown.

 
This chemical and similar compounds were used in the [[vulcanization]] of rubber for tires, and it had been noted that workers in those industries often had adverse reactions to alcohol; the connection between the reaction and exposure to these chemicals, though, had not been deduced. However in 1948 researchers Erik Jacobsen, Jens Hald, and Keneth Ferguson at the [[Denmark|Danish]] drug company [[Medicinalco]] uncovered the connection when they self-dosed with the chemical in the course of testing it as a possible anti-parasitic, and found themselves reacting violently to alcohol consumption.<ref>[http://www.alkohol.dk/antabus-hvad_er.htm Hvad er antabus, a Danish site describing the discovery of the drug’s effects.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506060446/http://www.alkohol.dk/antabus-hvad_er.htm |date=2009-05-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|title=Treatment of Alcoholism with Antabuse|first=Robert C.|last=Larimer|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=318202|volume=150|number=2|page=79|date= September 13, 1952|accessdate=2016-03-11|doi=10.1001/jama.1952.03680020013004}}</ref>
