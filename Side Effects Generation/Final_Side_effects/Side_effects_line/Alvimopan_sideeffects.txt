'''Alvimopan''' (trade name '''Entereg''') is a [[drug]] which behaves as a peripherally acting [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] [[antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonist]]. With the limited ability to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and reach the μ-opioid receptors of the [[central nervous system]], many of the clinically undesirable side-effects (such as [[euphoria]] and [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]) of centrally acting [[opioid]] agonists are minimized without affecting the intended activation of μ-opioid receptors of the [[peripheral nervous system]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  For the same reason, alvimopan has no [[analgesic]] properties at therapeutic doses.<ref name="neary_2005">{{cite journal | author=Neary P, Delaney P | title=Alvimopan | journal=Expert Opin Investig Drugs | year=2005 | pages=479–88 | volume=14 | issue=4 | pmid=15882122 | doi=10.1517/13543784.14.4.479}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Schmidt WK | title=Alvimopan* (ADL 8-2698) is a novel peripheral opioid antagonist | journal=Am J Surg | year=2001 | pages=27S–38S | volume=182 | issue=5A Supp | pmid=11755894 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9610(01)00784-X}}</ref> It is currently only [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved for the treatment of postoperative [[ileus]] which it received in May 2008.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01838.html   FDA press release - FDA Approves Entereg to Help Restore Bowel Function Following Surgery]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=A|author2=Jamal, MM|title=Opioid induced bowel disease: a twenty-first century physicians' dilemma.

== Adverse effects ==

 
The most common side effects associated with alvimopan are:<ref name="neary_2005" />

 
Alvimopan is absolutely contraindicated in patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than seven consecutive days immediately prior to when alvimopan would be initiated because individuals with recent exposure to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of mu-opioid receptor antagonists. The peripheral site of action of alvimopan suggests that such a heightened sensitivity would precipitate gastrointestinal effects beyond dyspepsia.<ref name="label" />
