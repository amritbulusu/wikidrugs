==Adverse effects and contraindications==

 
Pravastatin has undergone over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40-mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate pravastatin is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients.<ref>Pfeffer MA, Keech A, Sacks FM, et al. "Safety and tolerability of pravastatin in long-term clinical trials: prospective Pravastatin Pooling (PPP) Project." ''Circulation'' 2002;105:2341-2346</ref>  However, side effects may occur. A doctor should be consulted if symptoms such as heartburn or headache are severe and do not go away.

 
These uncommon side effects should be promptly reported to the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service:<ref name=AHFS />

 
[[Contraindication]]s, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with pravastatin, include pregnancy and breastfeeding.<ref name=RxList>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Eni|title=Pravachol Side Effects Center|url=http://www.rxlist.com/pravachol-side-effects-drug-center.htm|publisher=RxList|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> Taking pravastatin while pregnant could lead to birth defects. While the amount of pravastatin ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take pravastatin due to potential effects on the infant's lipid metabolism.<ref name=LactMed>{{cite web|title=Pravastatin|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~MNhuQa:1|work=LactMed|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>
