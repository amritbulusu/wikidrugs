It has been used experimentally to treat [[carcinoid syndrome]], but the side effects, mostly hypersensitivity reactions and psychiatric disturbances, have prevented development for this use.<ref>Kvols LK.

The effects of serotonin depletion from fenclonine are so drastic that serotonin cannot even be detected [[Histology|immunohistochemically]] within the first day after administration of a control dose. Tryptophan hydroxylase activity can be detected neither in cell bodies or nerve terminals. After one week 10% of control values (the baseline extrapolated for the study) had replenished in the raphe nucleus, and after two weeks from initial treatment as much was again detected in the hypothalamus region. Aromatic <small>L</small>-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) levels were at no time affected.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8015380 Early induction of rat brain tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) mRNA following parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) treatment.] Brain Res Mol Brain Res. 1994 Mar;22(1-4):20-8. {{PMID|8015380}}</ref>

 
It is used in scientific research in humans<ref>Ruh√© HG, Mason NS, Schene AH.
