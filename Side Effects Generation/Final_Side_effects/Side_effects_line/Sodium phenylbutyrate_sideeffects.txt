====Adverse effects====

 
Nearly 1/4 women may experience an [[adverse effect]] of [[amenorrhea]] or menstrual dysfunction.<ref name=NLM/> Appetite loss is seen is 4% of patients. Body odor due to metabolization of pheylbutyrate affects 3% of patients, and 3% experience unpleasant tastes. Gastrointestinal symptoms and mostly mild indications of [[neurotoxicity]] are also seen in less than 2% of patients, among several other reported adverse effects.<ref name=NLM/> Administration during pregnancy is not recommended because sodium phenylbutyrate treatment could mimic maternal [[phenylketonuria]] due to the production of phenylalanine, potentially causing fetal brain damage.<ref name=batshaw/>

 
University of Colorado researchers Dr. Curt Freed and Wenbo Zhou demonstrated that phenylbutyrate stops the progression of [[Parkinson's disease]] in mice by turning on a gene called [[DJ-1]] that can protect [[dopaminergic]] neurons in the [[midbrain]] from dying. {{As of|1=July 2011}} they plan on testing phenylbutyrate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in humans.<ref name="pmid21902286">{{cite journal | vauthors = Iannitti T, Palmieri B | title = Clinical and experimental applications of sodium phenylbutyrate | journal = Drugs R D | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 227â€“49 |date=September 2011  | pmid = 21902286 | pmc = 3586072 | doi = 10.2165/11591280-000000000-00000 | layurl=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_18407428#ixzz1RFVzEItR | laysource=Denver Post |laydate=7 March 2014 | quote = The same authors investigated the effects of phenylbutyrate on the accumulation of Parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like receptor (Pael-R), pathologically relevant to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, showing that (i) phenylbutyrate restores the normal expression of Pael-R protein and suppresses ER stress induced by the overexpression of Pael-R; (ii) phenylbutyrate attenuates the activation of ER stress-induced signal transduction pathways and subsequent neuronal cell death; and (iii) phenylbutyrate restores the viability of yeasts that fail to induce an ER stress response under ER stress conditions. These findings lead the author to conclude that phenylbutyrate suppresses ER stress by directly reducing the amount of misfolded protein, including Pael-R accumulated in the ER.[175]}}</ref>
