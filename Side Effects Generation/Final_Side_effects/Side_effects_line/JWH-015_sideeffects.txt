'''JWH-015''' is a chemical from the [[naphthoylindole]] family that acts as a subtype-selective [[cannabinoid]] agonist. Its affinity for [[Cannabinoid receptor 2 (macrophage)|CB<sub>2</sub> receptors]] is 13.8 nM, while its affinity for [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] is 383 nM, meaning that it binds almost 28x more strongly to CB<sub>2</sub> than CB<sub>1</sub><ref name="pmid10940540">{{cite journal |vauthors=Aung MM, Griffin G, Huffman JW, Wu M, Keel C, Yang B, Showalter VM, Abood ME, Martin BR | title = Influence of the N-1 alkyl chain length of cannabimimetic indoles upon CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub>)receptor binding | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–40 |date=August 2000 | pmid = 10940540 | doi =10.1016/S0376-8716(99)00152-0 }}</ref> However it still displays some CB<sub>1</sub> activity, and in some model systems can be very potent and efficacious at activating CB<sub>1</sub> receptors,<ref name="pmid22921769">{{cite journal |vauthors=Murataeva N, Mackie K, Straiker A | title = The CB2-preferring agonist JWH015 also potently and efficaciously activates CB1 in autaptic hippocampal neurons | journal = Pharmacol.
