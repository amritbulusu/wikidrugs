Colistimethate sodium, a less toxic prodrug, became available for injection in 1959. In the 1980s, polymyxin use was widely discontinued because of nephro- and neurotoxicity. As multi-drug resistant bacteria became more prevalent in the 1990s, colistin started to get a second look as an emergency solution, in spite of toxic effects.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Falagas M, Kasiakou S | title = Colistin: The Revival of Polymyxins for the Management of Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections | journal = Rev Anti Infect Agen | volume = 40 | year = 2005 }}</ref>

 
* Colistin A (polymyxin E1) and colistin B (polymyxin E2) can be purified individually to research and study their effects and potencies as separate compounds.

 
The main toxicities described with intravenous treatment are [[nephrotoxicity]] (damage to the kidneys) and neurotoxicity (damage to the nerves),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolinsky E, Hines JD | title = Neurotoxic and nephrotoxic effects of colistin in patients with renal disease | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 266 | issue = 15 | pages = 759–68 | year = 1962 | pmid = 14008070 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM196204122661505 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koch-Weser J, Sidel VW, Federman EB, Kanarek P, Finer DC, Eaton AE | title = Adverse effects of sodium colistimethate.
