For the next several decades, research on derivatives lapsed until phenothiazine itself came to market as an insecticide and deworming drug.  In the 1940s, chemists working with Paul Charpentier at Rhone-Poulenc Laboratories in Paris (a precursor company to [[Sanofi]], began making derivatives.  This work led to [[promethazine]] which had no activity against infective organisms, but did have good [[antihistamine]] activity, with a strong sedative effect. It went to market as a drug for allergies and for [[anesthesia]]. As of 2012 it was still on the market.<ref name=DDD/>  At the end of the 1940s the same lab produced [[chlorpromazine]] which had an even stronger sedative and soothing effect, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] attempted to use it on their psychiatric patients, publishing their results in the early 1950s.  The strong effects they found opened the door of the modern field of psychiatry and led to a proliferation of work on phenothiazine derivatives.<ref name=DDD/>  The systematic research conducted by chemists to explore phenothiazine derivatives and their activity was a pioneering example of [[medicinal chemistry]]; phenothiazine is often discussed as a prototypical example of a pharmaceutical [[Pharmacophore|lead structure]].<ref name=DDD/><ref name=Jaszczyszyn/>

 
The term "phenothiazines" describes the largest of the five main classes of [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drugs]]. These drugs have antipsychotic and, often, [[antiemetic]] properties, although they may also cause severe [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] such as [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] (including [[akathisia]] and [[tardive dyskinesia]]), [[hyperprolactinaemia]], and the rare but potentially fatal [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], as well as substantial weight gain.<ref name=DDD/>   Use of phenothiazines has been associated with [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], but no causal relationship has been established.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Antiphospholipid Syndrome - Doctor&#39;s Information {{!}} Patient|url = http://patient.info/doctor/antiphospholipid-syndrome-pro|website = Patient|accessdate = 2015-07-25}}</ref>
