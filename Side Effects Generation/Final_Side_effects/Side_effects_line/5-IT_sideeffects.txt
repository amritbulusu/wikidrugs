Although 5-IT is a [[positional isomer]] of the [[tryptamine]] drug [[alpha-methyltryptamine|αMT]], the compound is not itself a tryptamine as the indole ring is substituted at the 5 position rather than at the 3 position. The compound is closer chemically to phenethylamine derivatives such as [[5-APB]]. This is reflected in the compound's effects when used as a drug, which are reportedly stimulating rather than psychedelic.

 
== Dosage and effects ==

 
* 5-IT is a positional isomer of [[αMT]], and as such is considered legally the same as [[αMT]] under the [[Controlled Substance Act]] in the USA. (The Federal Analog Act includes a clause concerning the effects of the substance as well.)
