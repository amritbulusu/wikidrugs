A non-verified study from 2002 by the Progressive Medical Group claims that after testing the remedy on 52 patients, all of them had "at least minimal improvement not only in any upper gastrointestinal symptoms (probably associated with the natural digestive enzyme), but also in lower gastrointestinal symptoms and yeast-associated problems (altered cognition, craving carbohydrates, arthralgias, myalgias, allergies, etc.)." The study claims that side effects were "minimal with only rare gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, etc.) that resolved when association with food intake was altered", and that these side effects were deemed to not be statistically significant.<ref>[http://coastherbal.com/product_info.php/products_id/329 Candex, A Clinical Study, CoastHerbal.com]</ref> The study has not been reviewed by scientific peers, nor published in medical journals.  Some have questioned its usefulness due to the lack of a control group.
