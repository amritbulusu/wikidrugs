Secretin is found in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the [[hypothalamus]] and along the neurohypophysial tract to [[neurohypophysis]]. During increased osmolality, it is released from the [[posterior pituitary]]. In the hypothalamus, it activates [[vasopressin]] release.<ref name="Chu"/> It is also needed to carry out the central effects of angiotensin II. In the absence of secretin or its receptor in the gene knockout animals, central injection of angiotensin II was unable to stimulate water intake and vasopressin release.<ref name="pmid20739612">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee VH, Lee LT, Chu JY, Lam IP, Siu FK, Vaudry H, Chow BK |title=An indispensable role of secretin in mediating the osmoregulatory functions of angiotensin II |journal=FASEB Journal |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=5024–32 |year=2010 |pmid=20739612 |pmc=2992369 |doi=10.1096/fj.10-165399 }}</ref>
