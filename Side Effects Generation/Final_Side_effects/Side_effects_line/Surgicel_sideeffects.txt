Surgicel is used extensively in oral and maxillofacial surgery to control intrabony arterial bleeds from the inferior alveolar artery.  It is frequently used to stop bleeding following newborn circumcision if pressure alone is inadequate. When placed in the mandibular canal with the inferior alveolar nerve exposed there have been reports of neurotoxic effects.
