Coca was first introduced to Europe in the 16th century, but did not become popular until the mid-19th century, with the publication of an influential paper by Dr. [[Paolo Mantegazza]] praising its stimulating effects on cognition. This led to invention of [[coca wine]] and the first production of pure cocaine. Coca wine (of which [[Vin Mariani]] was the best-known brand) and other coca-containing preparations were widely sold as patent medicines and tonics, with claims of a wide variety of health benefits. The original version of [[Coca-Cola]] was among these. These products became illegal in most countries outside of South America in the early 20th century, after the addictive nature of cocaine was widely recognized. In 1859, [[Albert Niemann (chemist)|Albert Niemann]] of the [[University of Göttingen]] became the first person to isolate the chief alkaloid of coca, which he named "cocaine".<ref>{{cite book

 
The historic rationale for international prohibition of coca leaf in the 1961 Single Convention comes from "The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf study" published in 1950. It was requested of the United Nations by the permanent representative of Peru, and was prepared by a commission that visited Bolivia and Peru briefly in 1949 to "investigate the effects of chewing the coca leaf and the possibilities of limiting its production and controlling its distribution." It concluded that the effects of chewing coca leaves were negative, even though chewing coca was defined as a habit, not an addiction.<ref name=com>[https://www.tni.org/en/issues/unscheduling-the-coca-leaf/item/995-report-of-the-commission-of-enquiry-on-the-coca-leaf Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf], UNGASS 10-year review website, Transnational Institute</ref><ref name=bul>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1949-01-01_1_page006.html The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf], Bulletin on Narcotics – 1949 Issue 1</ref>
