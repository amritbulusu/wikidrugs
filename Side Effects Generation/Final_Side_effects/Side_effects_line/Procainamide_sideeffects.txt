==Side effects ==

 
There are many side effects following the induction of procainamide. These adverse effects are [[ventricular dysrhythmia]], [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. The adverse effects occur even more often if the daily doses are increased. Procainamide may also lead to [[drug fever]] and other [[allergic response]]s. There is also a chance that [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] occurs, which at the same time leads to [[polyarthralgia]], [[myalgia]] and [[pleurisy]]. Most of these side effects may occur due to the [[acetylation]] of procainamide.<ref name="adverse">{{cite journal |last1=Lawson |first1=DH |last2=Jick |first2=H |title= Adverse reactions to procainamide |journal= British journal of clinical pharmacology |date= October 1977 |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=507-11 |pmid= 911600 |pmc= 1429167}}</ref>

 
Due to the loss of Indonesia in [[World War II]], the source for [[cinchona alkaloids]], a precursor of [[quinidine]], was reduced. This led to research for a new [[antiarrhythmic drug]]. As a result, [[procaine]] was discovered, which has similar cardiac effects as quinidine.<ref name="one">MJA Walker: "Antiarrhythmic drug research".

Studies were done on various congeners and metabolites and this ultimately led to the discovery of procainamide by Mark ''et al''. It was found that procainamide was effective for treating [[ventricular arrhythmias]], but it had the same toxicity profile as quinidine, and it could cause [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]-like syndrome.<ref name="one" /><ref name="two" /> These negative characteristics slowed down the search for new antiarrhythmics based on the chemical structure of procainamide. In 1970 only five drugs were reported. These were the [[cardiac glycosides]], [[quinidine]], [[propranolol]], [[lidocaine]] and [[diphenylhydantoin]]. In January 1996, extended release procainamide hydrochloride (Procanbid extended-release tablets) was approved by the FDA.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2002/20545s007_Procanbid_biopharmr.pdf |title= Center for Drug Evaluation and Research: Drug Approval Package |last= |first=|date= |website=FDA |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}</ref>
