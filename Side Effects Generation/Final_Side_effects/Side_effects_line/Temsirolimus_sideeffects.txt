In patients with RCC, the adverse effect profile of temsirolimus is primarily metabolic in nature, with minimal impact on QoL compared with the commonly seen side-effects with oral multikinase inhibitors. Temsirolimus’ high level of specificity for mTOR likely contributes to the tolerability of temsirolimus. However, temsirolimus increases mortality in cancer patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdt155 |laysummary=http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/MGUCS/37404 |laysource=[[MedPage Today]] |laydate=Feb 17, 2013 |title=Incidence and risk of treatment-related mortality in cancer patients treated with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors |year=2013 |last1=Choueiri |first1=T.

The recommended dose of temsirolimus is 25&nbsp;mg IV infused over 30–60 minutes once per week (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2007). Weekly treatment may continue until disease progression or until patients experience intolerable side effects.

 
Although infusion reactions can occur while temsirolimus is being administered, most hypersensitivity reactions occurring on the same day as temsirolimus administration were not severe. [[Antihistamine]] pretreatment (e.g. 25–50&nbsp;mg diphenhydramine, 30 minutes prior to administration) is recommended to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction.<ref name="b">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdn066 |title=Temsirolimus safety profile and management of toxic effects in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and poor prognostic features |year=2008 |last1=Bellmunt |first1=J. |last2=Szczylik |first2=C. |last3=Feingold |first3=J. |last4=Strahs |first4=A. |last5=Berkenblit |first5=A. |journal=Annals of Oncology |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=1387–92 |pmid=18385198}}</ref><ref name="c"/>
