Isoxsuprine is most commonly used to treat hoof-related problems in the horse, most commonly for [[laminitis]] and [[navicular disease]], as its effects as a vasodilator are thought to increase circulation within the hoof to help counteract the problems associated with these conditions.  Isoxsuprine is given orally, and many horses find the pills quite palatable.<ref>{{cite book | author = Forney, Barbara C | title = Equine Medications | publisher = Blood Horse Publications | location = Lexington, KY | year = 2007}}</ref>  Isoxsuprine is a prohibited class B drug in [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]]-regulated competition, and is often prohibited by other equine associations. It may be detected in the urine for several weeks or months following administration. It is therefore important to check the drug-rules within an animal's given competitive organization, before administering the drug.
