Mathematical models describe one way in which a loss of infection control can occur after measures for screening and isolation seem to be effective for years, as happened in the UK. In the "search and destroy" strategy that was employed by all UK hospitals until the mid-1990s, all hospitalized people with MRSA were immediately isolated, and all staff were screened for MRSA and were prevented from working until they had completed a course of eradication therapy that was proven to work. Loss of control occurs because colonised people are discharged back into the community and then readmitted; when the number of colonised people in the community reaches a certain threshold, the "search and destroy" strategy is overwhelmed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper BS, Medley GF, Stone SP, Kibbler CC, Cookson BD, Roberts JA, Duckworth G, Lai R, Ebrahim S |title= Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' in hospitals and the community: stealth dynamics and control catastrophes |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume= 101 |issue= 27 |pages= 10223–8 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15220470 |pmc= 454191 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0401324101}}</ref> One of the few countries not to have been overwhelmed by MRSA is the [[Netherlands]]: An important part of the success of the Dutch strategy may have been to attempt eradication of carriage upon discharge from hospital.<ref name=bootsma2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bootsma MC, Diekmann O, Bonten MJ |title= Controlling methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'': quantifying the effects of interventions and rapid diagnostic testing |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume= 103 |issue= 14 |pages= 5620–5 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16565219 |pmc= 1459403 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0510077103}}</ref>
