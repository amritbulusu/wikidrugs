'''Troglitazone''' ('''Rezulin''', '''Resulin''', '''Romozin''', '''Noscal''') is an [[antidiabetic]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] drug, and a member of the [[medication|drug]] class of the [[thiazolidinedione]]s. It was prescribed for patients with [[diabetes mellitus type 2]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lawrence|title=Adverse Diabetes Drug News Sends Warner-Lambert Down|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/04/business/adverse-diabetes-drug-news-sends-warner-lambert-down.html|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 November 1997}}</ref>  It was developed by [[Daiichi Sankyo]] (Japan). In the United States, it was introduced and manufactured by [[Parke-Davis]] in the late 1990s, but turned out to be associated with an [[idiosyncratic drug reaction|idiosyncratic reaction]] leading to drug-induced [[hepatitis]]. The F.D.A. medical officer assigned to evaluate troglitazone, John Gueriguian, did not recommend its approval due to potential high liver toxicity; Parke-Davis complained to the FDA and Gueriguian was subsequently removed from his post.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/medtech/drugs/multimedia/2008/10/gallery_retired_drugs?slide=6&slideView=6 Retired Drugs: Failed Blockbusters, Homicidal Tampering, Fatal Oversights], wired.com</ref> A full panel of experts approved it in January 1997.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00125-006-0245-0 | title = Risks of troglitazone apparent before approval in USA | year = 2006 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J.

It did not get approval in the rest of Europe.

 
Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and – more strongly – PPARγ. Troglitazone also contains an α-tocopheroyl moiety, potentially giving it [[vitamin E]]-like activity in addition to its PPAR activation. It has been shown to reduce [[inflammation]]:<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Aljada A, Garg R, Ghanim H, etal |title=Nuclear factor-kappaB suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence of an antiinflammatory action? |journal=J.

NFκB is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response.

 
Troglitazone was developed as the first anti-diabetic drug having a mechanism of action involving the enhancement of insulin sensitivity.  At the time it was widely believed that such drugs, by addressing the primary metabolic defect associated with Type 2 diabetes, would have numerous benefits including avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia associated with insulin and earlier oral antidiabetic drugs.  It was further believed that reducing insulin resistance would potentially reduce the very high rate of cardiovascular disease that is associated with diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Henry RR |title=Effects of troglitazone on insulin sensitivity |journal=Diabet.

The F.D.A. approved the drug on January 29, 1997, and it appeared in pharmacies in late March. At the time Dr. Solomon Sobel, a director at the F.D.A., overseeing diabetes drugs, said in a [[New York Times]] interview that adverse effects of troglitazone appeared to be rare and relatively mild.<ref name=NYTapprove>{{cite news|last=Leary|first=Warren|title=New Class of Diabetes Drug Is Approved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/31/us/new-class-of-diabetes-drug-is-approved.html|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 January 1997}}</ref>
