It is a generic sold in Europe and China as '''Glucobay''' ([[Bayer|Bayer AG]]), in North America as '''Precose''' ([[Bayer|Bayer Pharmaceuticals]]), and in Canada as '''Prandase''' ([[Bayer|Bayer AG]]). It is cheap and popular in China, but not in the U.S. One physician explains the use in the U.S. is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-21/china-s-thirst-for-new-diabetes-drugs-threatens-bayer-s-lead.html |title= China’s Thirst for New Diabetes Drugs Threatens Bayer’s Lead |author = Naomi Kresge | date = 21 November 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111121232819/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-21/china-s-thirst-for-new-diabetes-drugs-threatens-bayer-s-lead.html | archivedate = 21 November 2011 | accessdate= 15 April 2016 |publisher= Bloomberg Business Week}}</ref> However, a recent large study concludes "acarbose is effective, safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes."<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 23435929 | doi=10.1007/s40261-013-0063-3 | volume=33 | title=A multinational, observational study to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of acarbose as add-on or monotherapy in a range of patients: the Gluco VIP study | journal=Clin Drug Investig | pages=263-74 | last1 = Zhang | first1 = W | last2 = Kim | first2 = D | last3 = Philip | first3 = E | last4 = Miyan | first4 = Z | last5 = Barykina | first5 = I | last6 = Schmidt | first6 = B | last7 = Stein | first7 = H | date = 2013}}</ref> A possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that acarbose is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high carbohydrate Eastern diet <ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 23602502 | doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.03.020 | volume=35 | title=Comparison of the hypoglycemic effect of acarbose monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus consuming an Eastern or Western diet: a systematic meta-analysis | journal=Clin Ther | pages=880-99 | last1 = Zhu | first1 = Q | last2 = Tong | first2 = Y | last3 = Wu | first3 = T | last4 = Li | first4 = J | last5 = Tong | first5 = N | date = 2013}}</ref>

 
==Side-effects==

 
Since acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon.  In the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], bacteria digest the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as [[flatulence]] (78% of patients) and [[diarrhea]] (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose-related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9428831 | volume=103 | issue=6 | title=Efficacy of 24-week monotherapy with acarbose, metformin, or placebo in dietary-treated NIDDM patients: the Essen-II Study |date=December 1997 | journal=Am.
