'''Propylhexedrine''' ('''Benzedrex''', '''Obesin''')  or hexahydromethamphetamine is a stimulant drug. It is an anolog of [[methamphetamine]] that is used medicinally as a [[nasal decongestant]] (for relief of congestion due to [[Common cold|colds]], [[Allergy|allergies]] and allergic [[rhinitis]]) and recreationally for its psychostimulant effects. When used as a [[vasoconstrictor]] used to decongest nasal mucosa, it is administered by [[inhalation]]. Propylhexedrine is a [[structural analog]] of [[methamphetamine]]. The only difference is that propylhexedrine has a saturated [[cyclohexane]] ring where methamphetamine has a [[benzene]] ring.

 
=== Effects ===

 
Propylhexedrine has [[sympathomimetic]], [[adrenergic agonist|adrenergic]], [[vasoconstrictor|vasocontricive]] and [[psychostimulant]] effects when taken above the medical dosage. Effects include increased [[sweating]], talkativeness, [[mydriasis]], [[emotional lability]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[tachycardia]], [[palpitations]], [[dry mouth]], [[bruxism]], [[anxiety]], [[euphoria]] or [[dysphoria]], increased [[aggressiveness]], [[paranoia]], [[headache]], [[dizziness]], [[psychosis]], slurred or impaired speech, rarely [[convulsions]] and serious [[heart]] problems.<ref name="Fornazzari">{{cite journal | first1=L | last1=Fornazzari | title=Intravenous Abuse of Propylhexedrine (Benzedrex®) and the Risk of Brainstem Dysfunction in Young Adults | last2=Carlen | first2=PL | last3=Kapur | first3=BM | journal=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences / Journal Canadien des Sciences Neurologiques | year=1986 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=337–339 | doi=10.1017/S0317167100036696 | pmid=2877725}}</ref> Propylhexedrine can also cause swelling, dryness and irritation of [[mucous membranes]].<ref>[https://www.caymanchem.com/msdss/12058m.pdf Safety Data Sheet - Cayman Chemical]</ref>

 
While propylhexedrine is limited in a number of administration routes, attempts to extract the drug from the nasal inhaler and then inject it have been reported. Recreational use by intravenous injection (IV) is dangerous and could result in serious bodily harm or death. IV use of propylhexedrine is known to cause mild side-effects such as [[diplopia|transient diplopia]] as well as some serious (and potentially fatal) effects such as brainstem dysfunction, and deaths have been recorded in the medical literature. Typically, recorded cases of IV use are prepared by forming propylhexedrine [[hydrochloride|HCl]] in a solution with hydrochloric acid, the solution is then heated to evaporate and the resulting crystals are dissolved in water for injection.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Proposed Rules | journal=Federal Register | volume=50 | issue=10 | pages=2226–2227}}</ref><ref>{{cite court | litigants= Prince v.
