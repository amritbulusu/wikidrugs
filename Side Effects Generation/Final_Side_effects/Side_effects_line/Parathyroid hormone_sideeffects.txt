[[File:Calcium balance 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A diagrammatic representation of the movements of calcium ions into and out of the blood plasma (the central square labeled  PLASMA Ca<sup>2+</sup>) in an adult in calcium balance.  The widths of the red arrows indicating movement into and out of the plasma are roughly in proportion to the daily amounts of calcium moved in the indicated directions. The size of the central square in not in proportion to the size of the diagrammatic bone, which represents the calcium present in the skeleton, and contains approximately 25,000&nbsp;mmol (or 1&nbsp;kg) of calcium compared to the 9&nbsp;mmol (360&nbsp;mg) dissolved in the blood plasma. The differently colored narrow arrows indicate where the specified hormones act, and their effects (“+” means stimulates; “-“ means inhibits) when their plasma levels are high. PTH is parathyroid hormone, 1,25&nbsp;OH&nbsp;VIT D<sub>3</sub> is [[calcitriol]] or 1,25&nbsp;dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, and [[Calcitonin|CALCITONIN]] is a hormone secreted by the [[thyroid gland]] when the plasma ionized calcium level is high or rising. The diagram does not show the extremely small amounts of calcium that move into and out of the cells of the body, nor does it indicate the calcium that is bound to the extracellular proteins (in particular the plasma proteins) or to plasma phosphate.<ref name="pmid25287933" /><ref name=Brini>{{cite book | first1 = Marisa | last1 = Brini | first2 = Denis | last2 = Ottolini | first3 = Tito | last3 = Calì | first4 = Ernesto | last4 = Carafoli | editor-first1 = Astrid | editor-last1 = Sigel  | editor-last2 = Helmut | editor-first2 = Roland K.

Parathyroid hormone regulates [[serum calcium]] through its effects on bone, kidney, and the intestine:<ref name="pmid15180028">{{cite journal | vauthors = Coetzee M, Kruger MC | title = Osteoprotegerin-receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand ratio: a new approach to osteoporosis treatment? | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 97 | issue = 5 | pages = 506–11 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15180028 | doi = 10.1097/00007611-200405000-00018 }}</ref>

 
In bone, PTH enhances the release of calcium from the large reservoir contained in the bones.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Poole KE, Reeve J | title = Parathyroid hormone - a bone anabolic and catabolic agent | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 612–7 | date = Dec 2005 | pmid = 16181808 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2005.07.004 }}</ref> [[Bone resorption]] is the normal destruction of bone by [[osteoclast]]s, which are indirectly stimulated by PTH. Stimulation is indirect since osteoclasts do not have a receptor for PTH; rather, PTH binds to [[osteoblast]]s, the cells responsible for creating bone. Binding stimulates osteoblasts to increase their expression of RANKL and inhibits their secretion of [[Osteoprotegerin]] (OPG). Free OPG competitively binds to [[RANKL]] as a decoy receptor, preventing RANKL from interacting with RANK, a receptor for RANKL. The binding of RANKL to [[RANK]] (facilitated by the decreased amount of OPG available for binding the excess RANKL) stimulates these osteoclast precursors to fuse, forming new osteoclasts, which ultimately enhances [[bone resorption]]. Another mechanism to regulate this pathways as PTH does is by estrogen. Estrogen suppresses T cell TNF production by regulating T cell differentiation and activity in the bone marrow, thymus, and peripheral lymphoid organs. In the bone marrow, estrogen downregulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells through an IL-7 dependent mechanism.<ref name="pmid12633785">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bord S, Ireland DC, Beavan SR, Compston JE | title = The effects of estrogen on osteoprotegerin, RANKL, and estrogen receptor expression in human osteoblasts | journal = Bone | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–41 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12633785 | doi = 10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00953-5 }}</ref>
