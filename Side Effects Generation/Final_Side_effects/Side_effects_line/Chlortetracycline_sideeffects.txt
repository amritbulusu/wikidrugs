Chlortetracycline may increase the anticoagulant activities of [[acenocoumarol]]. The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when chlortetracycline is combined with [[acitretin]], [[adapalene]], or [[alitretinoin]]. Aluminum phosphate and aluminum hydroxide can cause decreases in the absorption of chlortetracycline resulting in a reduced serum concentration and potentially a decrease in efficacy. The therapeutic efficacy of [[mecillinam]] (amdinocillin), [[amoxicillin]], and [[ampicillin]] can be decreased when used in combination with chlortetracycline. Chlortetracycline may increase the neuromuscular blocking activities of [[atracurium besilate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09093 |title=Chlortetracycline - DrugBank |website=Drugbank.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}</ref>
