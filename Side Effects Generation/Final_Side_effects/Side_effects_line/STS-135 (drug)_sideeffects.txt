'''STS-135''' ('''''N''-(adamantan-1-yl)-1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1''H''-indole-3-carboxamide''', also called '''5F-APICA''') is a [[designer drug]] offered by online vendors as a cannabimimetic agent. The structure of STS-135 appears to use an understanding of [[structure-activity relationship]]s within the indole class of cannabimimetics, although its design origins are unclear.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1071/CH14198| title = Bioisosteric Fluorine in the Clandestine Design of Synthetic Cannabinoids| journal = Australian Journal of Chemistry| volume = 68| pages = 4| year = 2015| last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = S.
