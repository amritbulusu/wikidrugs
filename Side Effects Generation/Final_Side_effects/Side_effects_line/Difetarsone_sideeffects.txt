'''Difetarsone''' is an [[antiprotozoal agent]]. Various studies have shown it to be particularly effective against ''[[Trichuris trichiura]]'', commonly known as the whipworm. Prior to the drugs use in the early 1970s, there were few effective treatments for this infection.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Difetarsone in Difetarsone in outpatient treatment of Trichuris trichiura infestation |author1=P.M.
