== Adverse effects ==

 
Side effects from taking glimepiride include [[gastrointestinal tract]] (GI) disturbances, occasional allergic reactions, and rarely blood production disorders including [[thrombocytopenia]], [[leukopenia]], and [[hemolytic anemia]]. In the initial weeks of treatment, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased. Alcohol consumption and exposure to sunlight should be restricted because they can worsen side effects.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>
