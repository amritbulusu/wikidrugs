'''Cefodizime''' is a 3rd generation [[cephalosporin]] antibiotic with [[Broad-spectrum antibiotic|broad spectrum]] activity against aerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Clinically, it has been shown to be effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and gonorrhea. Cefodizime is a bactericidal antibiotic that targets penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1A/B, 2, and 3 resulting in the eventual death of the bacterial cell. ''In vivo'' experimental models of infection showed that bacterial clearance by this drug is at least as effective compared with other 3rd generation cephalosporins. It has similar adverse effect profile to other 3rd generation cephalosporins as well, mainly being limited to gastrointestinal or dermatological side effects.<ref name=Barradell>{{cite journal|last1=Barradell|first1=Lee B.|last2=Brogden|first2=Rex N.|title=Cefodizime: A Review of its Antibacterial Activity, Pharmacokinetic Properties and Therapeutic Use|journal=Drugs|date=1993|volume=44|issue=5|pages=800–834|pmid=1280568|doi=10.2165/00003495-199244050-00008 }}</ref>

 
Cefodizime demonstrated superior clinical efficacy that what could be predicted from its ''in vitro'' experimental results. Certain immunomodulatory properties of the drug might account for its increased ''in vivo'' activity against specific bacterial species. These immunomodulatory properties stimulate some phagocyte and lymphocyte cellular functions when they have been impaired.<ref name=Barradell /> It was shown in a 2004 study that cefodizime increased expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in neutrophils stimulated by ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' infection which then affected the production of cytokines in the stimulated cells.<ref name=Song>{{cite journal|last1=Song|first1=H|last2=Li|first2=G|last3=Ye|first3=J|last4=Qian|first4=Y|title=Immunomodulating effects of cefodizime on Klebsiella pneumoniae-stimulated neutrophils.|journal=Immunobiology|date=2004|volume=209|issue=3|pages=277–82|pmid=15518339|doi=10.1016/j.imbio.2004.05.003}}</ref>

 
== Adverse effects ==

 
Cefodizime has been shown to be generally well tolerated in drug trials and its adverse effects are mainly gastrointestinal or dermatological. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed in 2.4% of patients during clinical trials and included: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and elevated transaminases. Allergic symptoms were observed in 1.1% of patients and include: [[exanthema]], [[urticaria]], and [[pruritus]]. Other adverse effects observed include local site reactions, pain at site of injection, and [[phlebitis]].<ref name=Barradell />
