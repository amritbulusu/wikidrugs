Though it vaporises very readily, it is a liquid at room temperature. [[Anaesthetic machine]]s are fitted with a specialized [[anaesthetic vaporiser]] unit that heats liquid desflurane to a constant temperature.  This enables the agent to be available at a constant vapor pressure, negating the effects fluctuating ambient temperatures would otherwise have on its concentration imparted into the fresh gas flow of the anesthesia machine.
