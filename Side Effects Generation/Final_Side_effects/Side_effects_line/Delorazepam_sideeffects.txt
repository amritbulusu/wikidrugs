Delorazepam is well absorbed after administration, reaching peak plasma levels within 1 – 2 hours.

==Side effects and contraindications==

 
Delorazepam hosts all the classic side-effects of GABA<sub>A</sub> full agonists (such as most benzodiazepines). These include sedation/[[somnolence]], dizziness/[[ataxia]], amnesia, reduced inhibition, increased talkativeness/sociability, euphoria, impaired judgement, hallucinations, and respiratory depression. [[Paradoxical]] reactions including increased anxiety, [[Psychomotor agitation|excitation]], and aggression may occur and are more common in elderly, pediatric, and schizophrenic patients. In rare instances, delorazepam may cause suicidal ideation and actions.

 
The most serious effect of long term delorazepam use is dependence, with withdrawal symptoms which mimic [[delirium tremens]] presenting when delorazepam use is discontinued. Although the withdrawal effects from delorazepam are generally less severe than its shorter-acting counterparts, they can be life-threatening. Slow de-titration of delorazepam over a period of weeks or months is generally suggested to minimize the severity of withdrawal. Psychological effects of withdrawal such as rebound anxiety and insomnia have been known to persist for months after physical dependence has been successfully treated.

 
People with [[renal failure]] on [[haemodialysis]] have a slow elimination rate and a reduced volume of distribution of the drug.<ref name="Sennesael-1991">{{Cite journal | last1 = Sennesael | first1 = J. | last2 = Verbeelen | first2 = D. | last3 = Vanhaelst | first3 = L. | last4 = Pirola | first4 = R. | last5 = Bareggi | first5 = SR. | title = Pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral chlordesmethyldiazepam in patients on regular haemodialysis | journal = Eur J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–8 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1782980 | doi = 10.1007/BF00280109 }}</ref> Liver disease has a profound effect on the elimination rate of delorazepam, resulting in the half-life almost doubling to 395 hours, whereas healthy patients showed an elimination half-life of 204 hours on average.
