Along with strong [[sedation|sedative]] effects, embutramide also produces [[respiratory depression]] and [[Cardiac arrhythmia|ventricular arrhythmia]]. Because of these properties, it was never adopted for medical use as an anesthetic as it was considered too dangerous for this purpose. Instead it is used for [[Animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] in [[veterinary medicine]], mainly for the euthanization of dogs.
