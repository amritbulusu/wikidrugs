'''Trimethobenzamide''' (trade names '''Tebamide''', '''Tigan''') is an [[antiemetic]] used to prevent [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. It is often prescribed for patients with [[gastroenteritis]], medication-induced nausea, and other illnesses. Trimethobenzamide is generally considered the most potent antiemetic that does not have effects on the serotonergic, dopaminergic, or histaminergic systems, so it has a lower likelihood of causing undesired side effects. In the United States, it requires a prescription.
