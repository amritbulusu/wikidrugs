'''Cloroqualone''' is a quinazolinone-class [[Gabaergic|GABAergic]] and is an analogue of [[methaqualone]] developed in the 1980s and marketed mainly in France and some other European countries. It has [[sedative]] and [[antitussive]] properties resulting from its agonist activity at the Î² subtype of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>a</sub> receptor]] and [[sigma-1 receptor]], and was sold either alone or in combination with other ingredients as a [[cough medicine]]. Cloroqualone has weaker sedative properties than methaqualone and was sold for its useful cough-suppressing effects, but was withdrawn from the French market in 1994 because of concerns about its potential for abuse and overdose.
