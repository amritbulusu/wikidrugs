'''Thiopropamine''' is a [[stimulant]] drug which is an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[amphetamine]] where the [[phenyl]] ring has been replaced by [[thiophene]]. It has similar stimulant effects to amphetamine but with around one third the potency. The [[Methiopropamine|N-methyl]] and thiophen-3-yl analogues are also known and are somewhat more potent, though still generally weaker than the corresponding amphetamines.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/72/3/265.abstract |last1=Alles |first1=Gordon A. |last2= Feigen |first2=George A. |title=Comparative Physiological Actions of Phenyl-, Thienyl- and Furylisopropylamines |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |date=July 1941 |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=265–75}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01646a054 |title=3-Substituted Thiophenes.
