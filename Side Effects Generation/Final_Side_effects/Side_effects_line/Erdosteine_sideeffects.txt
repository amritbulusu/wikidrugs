'''Erdosteine''' is a [[mucolytic agent|mucolytic]]. Specifically it is a [[thiol]] derivative developed for the treatment of [[chronic bronchitis|chronic obstructive bronchitis]], including acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Erdosteine contains two blocked sulfhydryl groups which are released following [[first pass effect|first-pass metabolism]]. The three active metabolites exhibit mucolytic and [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] scavenging activity. Erdosteine modulates mucus production and viscosity and increases mucociliary transport, thereby improving expectoration. It also exhibits inhibitory activity against the effects of free radicals produced by cigarette smoke.
