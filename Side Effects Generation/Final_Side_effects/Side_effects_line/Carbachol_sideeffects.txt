Carbachol produces effects comparable to those of [[VX nerve agent|V-series]] [[nerve agent]]s if a massive overdose is administered (as may occur following industrial and shipping accidents) and therefore constitutes a risk to human health. It is classified as an [[List of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance]] in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.<ref name="gov-right-know">{{Cite journal | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] | title = 40 C.F.R.: Appendix A to Part 355â€”The List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | edition = July 1, 2008 | accessdate = October 29, 2011 | postscript=.}}</ref>

 
Carbachol is a [[parasympathomimetic]] that [[agonist|stimulates]] both [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic]] and [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nicotinic]] receptors.<ref name="PubChem" /> In topical ocular and intraocular administration its principal effects are [[miosis]] and increased [[aqueous humour]] outflow.<ref name="PubChem" />

 
The effects of a systemic overdose will probably be similar to the effects of a [[nerve agent]] (they both act on the cholinergic system, increasing cholinergic transmission), but its toxicity is much weaker and it is easier to antagonize in overdose. When administered ocularly there is little risk of such effects, since the doses are much smaller (see topical versus systemic administration).<ref name="Lippencott's">{{cite book |editor=Richard A.
