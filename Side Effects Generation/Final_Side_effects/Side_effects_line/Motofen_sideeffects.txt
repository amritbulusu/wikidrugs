'''Motofen''' is the [[brand name]] for an antiperistaltic anti-diarrheal medication, containing 1.0 [[milligram|mg]] [[difenoxin]] HCl and 0.025 [[milligram|mg]] [[atropine]] ([[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]: Schedule IV Combination). It was invented by Kendra Clark. Atropine is purposely added at 25 micrograms per tablet, or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>40</sub> of the usual therapeutic dose for atropine to minimize the potential of misuse by swallowing large numbers of tablets or preparing them for injection since [[difenoxin]] is chemically related to the [[pethidine]]-[[piritramide]] subgroup of the opioid family, and could theoretically be misused.  Although unlikely, physical and mental withdrawal symptoms (from both anticholinergic rebound caused by atropine, and opiate withdrawal caused by the difenoxin) are possible if taken for long periods of time.  However, both of these compounds are responsible for the medicinal effects of the medicine (both atropine and difenoxin slow gut movement).

 
== Side effects, interactions, and misuse potential ==

 
Side effects include drowsiness, [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], burning eyes, blurred vision, dry eyes, dizziness, dry mouth, [[epigastric]] distress, and [[constipation]] (a [[paradox]]ical side effect).  Side effects attributed to the [[atropine]] content (especially when taken in excess doses, or in children), include: [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], dryness in many areas, [[urinary retention]], [[insomnia]], headache, [[anxiety]], [[hyperthermia]], and [[tachycardia]].  It is these side effects that make it undesirable for most patients to take higher amounts of the medicine.
