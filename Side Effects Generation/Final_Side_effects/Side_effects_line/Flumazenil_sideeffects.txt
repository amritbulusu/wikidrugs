It has been used as an [[antidote]] in the treatment of [[benzodiazepine overdose]]s.<ref name=gold2002/> It reverses the effects of benzodiazepines by [[competitive inhibitor|competitive inhibition]] at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].  There are many complications that must be taken into consideration when used in the [[acute care]] setting.<ref name=gold2002/> These include lowered seizure threshold, agitation, and anxiousness. Flumazenil's short half-life requires multiple doses and careful patient monitoring to prevent recurrence of overdose symptoms.

 
It is also sometimes used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines after surgery in a manner similar to [[naloxone]]'s application to reverse the effect of [[opiates]] and [[opioids]] following surgery. This requires careful monitoring by an anesthesiologist due to potential side effects and serious risks associated with both over-administering flumazenil and the removal of patient life-support and monitoring equipment before the benzodiazepines have worn off (due to flumazenil masking their continued effect).

 
The onset of action is rapid and usually effects are seen within one to two minutes. The peak effect is seen at six to ten minutes. The recommended dose for adults is 200 μg every 1–2 minutes until the effect is seen, to a maximum of 3&nbsp;mg per hour. It is available as a clear, colourless solution for [[intravenous injection]], containing 500 μg in 5 mL.

| title = Reduction of aggression during benzodiazepine withdrawal: effects of flumazenil

 
Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes the actions of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the [[GABAA receptor|GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex]]. Because the body does not produce endogenous benzodiazepines, flumazenil only creates behavioral effects when administered concurrently with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist or inverse agonist. Flumazenil is a weak partial agonist in some animal models of activity, but has little or no agonist activity in humans.

 
Flumazenil does not antagonize all of the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, or general anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids.

 
The duration and degree of reversal of sedative benzodiazepine effects are related to the dose and plasma concentrations of flumazenil.
