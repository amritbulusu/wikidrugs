Sugammadex, unlike [[neostigmine]], does not inhibit [[acetylcholinesterase]] so [[cholinergic]] effects are not produced and co-administration of an [[antimuscarinic]] agent ([[glycopyrronium bromide]] or [[atropine]]) is not needed. Sugammadex might therefore be expected to have fewer adverse effects than the traditional reversal agents.
