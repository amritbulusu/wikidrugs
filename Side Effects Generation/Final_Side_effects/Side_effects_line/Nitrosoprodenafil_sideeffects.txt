'''Nitrosoprodenafil''' is a synthetic [[designer drug]] found in "herbal" [[aphrodisiac]] products, which is a novel nitrosated [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[sildenafil]] (Viagra). It has an innovative structure which acts as a [[prodrug]], breaking down in the body to release both the [[cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5|PDE<sub>5</sub>]] inhibitor [[aildenafil]] as well as free [[nitric oxide]], which have powerfully synergistic effects. This dual mechanism of action has never been exploited by conventional pharmaceutical companies because of the risks involved; usually combining [[PDE5 inhibitor|PDE<sub>5</sub> inhibitors]] with nitric oxide releasers like [[amyl nitrite]] is contraindicated as it can cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure that can potentially result in death. [[Nitrosamine]]s are also generally avoided in drug development as they can often be [[hepatotoxic]], so while the combined mechanisms of action are likely to be effective, this drug also has severe risks of toxicity.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Venhuis, B.
