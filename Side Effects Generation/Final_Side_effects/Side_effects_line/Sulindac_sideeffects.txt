Like other NSAIDs, it is useful in the treatment of [[Acute (medical)|acute]] or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[inflammation|inflammatory]] conditions. Sulindac is a [[prodrug]], derived from [[sulfinylindene]], that is converted in the body to the active NSAID. More specifically, the agent is converted by liver enzymes to a sulfide that is excreted in the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestine. This is thought to help maintain constant blood levels with reduced gastrointestinal side effects. Some studies have shown sulindac to be relatively less irritating to the stomach than other NSAIDs except for drugs of the [[COX-2 inhibitor]] class {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The exact mechanism of its NSAID properties is unknown, but it is thought to act on enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, inhibiting [[prostaglandin]] synthesis.
