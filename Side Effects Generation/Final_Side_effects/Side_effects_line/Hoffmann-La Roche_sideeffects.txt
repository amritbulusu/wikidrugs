Founded in 1896 by [[Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche]], the company was early on known for producing various [[vitamin]] preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
