There are two types of TNF [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s: those found embedded in white blood cells that respond to TNF by releasing other cytokines, and ''soluble'' TNF receptors which are used to deactivate TNF and blunt the immune response. In addition, TNF receptors are found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells (red blood cells, which are not nucleated, do not contain TNF receptors on their surface). Etanercept mimics the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors, the difference being that etanercept, because it is a fusion protein rather than a simple TNF receptor, has a greatly extended half-life in the bloodstream, and therefore a more profound and long-lasting biologic effect than a naturally occurring soluble TNF receptor.<ref name="pmid16135466">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Madhusudan S, Muthuramalingam SR, Braybrooke JP, etal |title=Study of etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor, in recurrent ovarian cancer |journal=J.
