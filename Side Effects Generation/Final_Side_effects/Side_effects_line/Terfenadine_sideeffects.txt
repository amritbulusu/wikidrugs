Terfenadine acts as a [[peripherally-selective drug|peripherally-selective]] [[antihistamine]], or [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]]. It is a [[prodrug]], generally completely [[metabolism|metabolized]] to the active form [[fexofenadine]] in the [[liver]] by the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome P450 3A4]]. Due to its near complete metabolism by the liver immediately after leaving the gut, terfenadine normally is not measurable in the plasma. Terfenadine itself, however, is [[cardiotoxic]] at higher doses, while its major [[active metabolite]] is not. Terfenadine, in addition to its antihistamine effects, also acts as a [[potassium channel blocker]] (K<sub>v</sub>11.1 encoded by the gene ''[[hERG]]''). Since its active metabolite is not a potassium channel blocker, no cardiotoxicity is associated with [[fexofenadine]].<ref name="Cir1996"/> Toxicity is possible after years of continued use with no previous problems as a result of an interaction with other medications such as [[erythromycin]], or foods such as [[List of drugs affected by grapefruit|grapefruit]]. The addition of, or a dosage increase in, these CYP3A4 inhibitors makes it harder for the body to metabolize and remove terfenadine. In larger plasma concentrations, it may lead to toxic effects on the heart's rhythm (e.g. [[ventricular tachycardia]] and ''[[torsades de pointes]]'').
