Decongestants can be absorbed from the nose via an [[inhaler]] and produce systemic effects, mainly [[central nervous system]] stimulation and rise in [[blood pressure]]. These drugs should be used cautiously in hypertensives and in those receiving [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs), as they can cause [[hypertensive crisis]].

 
Decongestant nasal sprays and eye drops often contain [[oxymetazoline]] and are used for [[topical decongestant|topical decongestion]]. Pseudoephedrine acts indirectly on the adrenergic receptor system, whereas phenylephrine and oxymetazoline are direct [[agonists]]. The effects are not limited to the nose, and these medicines may cause [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) through [[vasoconstriction]]; it is for this reason that people with hypertension are advised to avoid them. Most decongestants, however, are not pronounced stimulants, due to lack of response from the other adrenoreceptors. Besides hypertension, common side-effects include sleeplessness, anxiety, dizziness, excitability, and nervousness.
