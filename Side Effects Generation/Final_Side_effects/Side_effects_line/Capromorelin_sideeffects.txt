In a one-year treatment trial (starting 1999) with 395 seniors between 65 and 84 years old, patients who received the drug gained an average of 3&nbsp;lb (1.4&nbsp;kg) in lean body mass in the first six months and also were better able to walk in a straight line in a test of balance, strength and coordination. After 12 months, patients receiving capromorelin also had an improved ability to climb stairs, however the results were not good enough to continue the trial for the 2nd planned year.<ref>Heidi K.
