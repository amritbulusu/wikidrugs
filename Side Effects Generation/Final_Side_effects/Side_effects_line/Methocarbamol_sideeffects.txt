'''Methocarbamol''' is a central [[muscle relaxant]] used to treat [[skeletal muscle]] [[spasm]]s. Under the trade name '''Robaxin''', it is marketed by Actient Pharmaceuticals in the United States and [[Pfizer]] in Canada. The mechanism of action of methocarbamol is currently unknown, but may involve the inhibition of [[carbonic anhydrase]].<ref name = "Parr_Khalifah_1992">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parr JS, Khalifah RG | title = Inhibition of carbonic anhydrases I and II by N-unsubstituted carbamate esters | journal = J Biol Chem | date = 1992 | volume = 267 | issue = 35 | pages = 25044–25050 | pmid = 1460006}}</ref> The muscle relaxant effects of methocarbamol are largely attributed to central depressant effects;<ref name = "Truitt_Little_1958">{{cite journal |author1=Truitt EB Jr. |author2=Little JM. | title = A pharmacologic comparison of methocarbamol (AHR-85), the monocarbamate of 3-(o-methoxyphenoxy)-1,2-propanediol with chemically related interneuronal depressant drugs | journal = J Pharmacol Exp Ther | date = 1958 | volume = 122 | issue = 2 | pages = 239–246 | pmid = 13514612}}</ref> however, peripheral effects of methocarbamol to prolong muscle [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] have also been reported.<ref name = "Crankshaw_Raper_1968">{{cite journal |vauthors=Crankshaw DP, Raper C | title = Some studies on peripheral actions of mephenesin, methocarbamol and diazepam | journal = Br J Pharmacol | date = 1968 | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 579–590 | pmid = 5726787 | doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1968.tb08486.x | pmc=1703503}}</ref> As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is less than 25 USD.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=2}}</ref>

 
==Side-effects==

 
Potential side-effects include: drowsiness, dizziness, clumsiness ([[ataxia]]), upset stomach, flushing, blurred vision, and fever. Both [[tachycardia]] (fast heart rate) and [[bradycardia]] (slow heart rate) have been reported;<ref>[http://Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/methocarbamol medical-dictionary_thefreedictionary-methocarbamol]</ref><ref>[http://www.drugs.com/sfx/methocarbamol-side-effects.html Drugs.com-methocarbamol-side-effects]</ref> these can be serious. Other serious side-effects include the development of a severe skin rash or itching, fainting, jaundice, persistent nausea/vomiting, stomach/abdominal pain, mental/mood changes, trouble urinating, and signs of infection. If taken in large amounts at once or more than directed or as prescribed, dysphoria or suicidal thoughts may occur.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/methocarbamol-oral/article.htm METHOCARBAMOL – ORAL (Robaxin) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions].

However, this effect is harmless.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682579.html#side-effects Methocarbamol: MedlinePlus Drug Information]. Nlm.nih.gov.

Because of the potential for side-effects, this drug is considered to be a high-risk medication for the elderly.<ref>See NCQA’s HEDIS Measure: [http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf Use of High Risk Medications in the Elderly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201113909/http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |date=2010-02-01 }}</ref>

 
Unlike other carbamates such as [[meprobamate]] and its prodrug [[carisoprodol]], methocarbamol has greatly reduced abuse potential.  Studies comparing it to the benzodiazepine [[lorazepam]] and the antihistamine [[diphenhydramine]], along with placebo, find that methocarbamol produces increased "liking" responses and some sedative-like effects, however, at higher doses [[dysphoria]] is reported.  It is considered to have an abuse profile similar to, but weaker than, lorazepam.<ref name = "PubMed">{{cite journal | title = Subjective and behavioral effects of diphenhydramine, lorazepam and methocarbamol: evaluation of abuse liability | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | pmid=1501118 | volume=262 | pages=707–20 | vauthors=Preston KL, Wolf B, Guarino JJ, Griffiths RR}}</ref>
