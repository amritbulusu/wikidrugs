'''AB-005''' or '''[1-[(1-methyl-2-piperidinyl)methyl]-1''H''-indol-3-yl](2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)-methanone''' is a [[designer drug]] offered by online vendors as a cannabimimetic agent. The structure and pharmacological activity of AB-005 was published in 2010, prior to its commercial availability in 2012, where it was reported to have high affinity for both CB1 (''K''<sub>i</sub> = 5.5 nM) and CB2 receptors (''K''<sub>i</sub> = 0.48 nM).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Frost |first1= J.
