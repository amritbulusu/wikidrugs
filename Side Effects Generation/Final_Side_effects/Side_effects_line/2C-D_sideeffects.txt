Not much information is known about the toxicity of 2C-D, as no major studies have been conducted. According to Shulgin, the effects of 2C-D typically last for 4–6 hours. Shulgin himself referred to this substance as a “pharmacological [[tofu]],” meaning that when mixed with other substances, it can extend or potentiate their effects without coloring the experience too much, in a manner similar to how tofu absorbs the flavors of sauces or spices it is cooked with. Some people have claimed 2C-D is relatively uninteresting on its own, but many other users have strongly disagreed with this assessment and believe instead 2C-D to be a true [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] in its own right. [[Hanscarl Leuner]], working in Germany, explored the use of 2C-D under the name LE-25 in psychotherapeutic research.
