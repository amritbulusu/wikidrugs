== Side effects ==

 
The main [[Adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s of exenatide use are gastrointestinal in nature, including acid or sour stomach, belching, diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and vomiting; exenatide is therefore not meant for people with severe gastrointestinal disease. Other side effects include dizziness, headache, and feeling jittery.<ref name="drugs.com">[http://www.drugs.com/cons/byetta.html Drugs.com Accessed September 6, 2008].</ref> Drug interactions listed on the package insert include delayed or reduced concentrations of [[lovastatin]], [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), and [[digoxin]], although this has not been proven to alter the effectiveness of these other medications.   

 
Exenatide is a synthetic version of exendin-4, a [[hormone]] found in the saliva of the [[Gila monster]] that was first isolated by [[John Eng MD]] in 1992 while working at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in the Bronx, New York. It is a 39-[[amino-acid]] [[peptide]], an insulin [[secretagogue]], with glucoregulatory effects. Exenatide was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] on April 28, 2005 for patients whose diabetes was not well-controlled on other [[antidiabetic drug|oral medication]].<ref name="fda-approval">[http://www.fda.gov/cder/rdmt/InternetNDA05.htm CDER Drug and Biologic Approvals for Calendar Year 2005], from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]. Accessed August 28, 2008.</ref> The medication is injected subcutaneously twice per day using a filled pen-like device (Byetta), or on a weekly basis with either a pen-like device or conventional syringe (Bydureon). The abdomen is a common injection site, after the area is cleaned with an alcohol pad. A new pen must first be tested to see if the medicine is flowing.

 
Commercially, exenatide is produced by direct chemical synthesis. Historically, exenatide was discovered as Exendin-4, a protein naturally secreted in the saliva and concentrated in the tail of the [[Gila monster]]. Exendin-4 shares extensive homology and function with mammalian GLP-1, but has a therapeutic advantage in its resistance to degradation by DPP-IV (which breaks down GLP-1 in mammals) therefore allowing for a longer pharmacological half life. The biochemical characteristics of Exendin-4 enabled consideration and development of exenatide as a diabetes mellitus treatment strategy. Given this history, exenatide is sometimes referred to as "lizard spit". Subsequent clinical testing led to the discovery of the also desirable glucagon and appetite-suppressant effects.

 
In August 2013, a federal judiciary panel approved the consolidation of 53 lawsuits against manufacturers of "GLP-1/DPP-4 products" before a judge in U.S. District Court in San Diego. Claims involving allegations of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and other side effects attributed to the use of Januvia, Janumet, Byetta and Victoza will continue to be eligible for review.  The order referenced the March 2013 FDA study announcement that included the drugs exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), sitagliptin (Januvia, Janumet, Janumet XR, Juvisync), [[saxagliptin]] (Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR), [[alogliptin]] (Nesina, Kazano, Oseni), and [[linagliptin]] (Tradjenta, Jentadueto).<ref name='USJP, 2013'>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/sites/jpml/files/MDL-2452-Initial_Transfer-07-13.pdf | title = IN RE: INCRETIN MIMETICS PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATION | accessdate = 2013-08-26 | date = August 26, 2013 | work = USJP | publisher = United States Judicial Panel on Multidistric Litigation}}</ref>
