'''Pagoclone''' is an [[anxiolytic]] agent from the [[cyclopyrrolone]] family, related to better-known drugs such as the sleeping medication [[zopiclone]]. It was synthesized by a French team working for Rhone-Poulenc & Rorer S.A.<ref>2-amino naphthyridine derivative, its preparation and its use US 5498716</ref> Pagoclone belongs to the class of [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s, which have similar effects to the older [[benzodiazepine]] group, but with quite different [[chemical structure]]s. It was never commercialised.

 
It binds with roughly equivalent high affinity (0.7–9.1 nM) to the benzodiazepine [[binding site]] of human [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] containing either an α1, α2, α3 or α5 [[Protein subunit|subunit]]. It is a [[partial agonist]] at α1-, α2- and α5-containing GABAA receptors and a full agonist at receptors containing an α3 subunit. In rats 5′-hydroxypagoclone was identified as a major [[metabolite]]. This metabolite has a considerably greater [[efficacy]] at the α1 subtype than the parent compound and was shown to have significant anxiolytic-like activity and to produce sedation.<ref name="pmid16430927">{{cite journal |vauthors=Atack JR, Pike A, Marshall G, Stanley J, Lincoln R, Cook SM, Lewis RT, Blackaby WP, Goodacre SC, McKernan RM, Dawson GR, Wafford KA, Reynolds DS |title=The in vivo properties of pagoclone in rat are most likely mediated by 5'-hydroxy pagoclone |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=677–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16430927 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2005.11.014 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Atack | first1 = JR | date = May 2005 | title = The benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors as a target for the development of novel anxiolytics | url = | journal = Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 601–18 | doi=10.1517/13543784.14.5.601 | pmid=15926867}}</ref> In contrast to zopiclone, pagoclone produces anxiolytic effects with little [[sedative]] or [[amnestic]] actions at low doses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Atack | first1 = JR | date = Aug 2003 | title = Anxioselective compounds acting at the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine binding site | url = | journal = Current Drug Targets.

The pharmacologist [[David Nutt]] has suggested pagoclone as a possible base from which to make a better social drug, as it produces the positive effects of [[alcohol]], such as relaxation and sociability, but without also causing the negative effects  like aggression, [[amnesia]], [[nausea]], loss of coordination and liver damage. Its effect can be quickly reversed by the action of [[flumazenil]], which is already used as an antidote to [[benzodiazepine overdose]].<ref>{{cite journal | author= Nutt DJ| title=  For "Critique and Commentaries" section of the Journal of Psychopharmacology: Alcohol alternatives - a goal for psychopharmacology? | journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology| year=2006  | volume=20 | pages=318–320 | doi=10.1177/0269881106063042 | pmid= 16574703 | issue= 3}}</ref> Nutt has published studies<ref>{{cite journal | author= Lingford-Hughes A | title=  A proof-of-concept study using [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil PET to demonstrate that pagoclone is a partial agonist | journal=Psychopharmacology| year=2005  | volume=180 | pages=1–3 | pmid=15986186 | doi=10.1007/s00213-005-0060-1 | issue= 4 | display-authors= 1 | last2= Wilson | first2= S.

The long-term safety of pagoclone has not been assessed. The abuse potential of pagoclone has been assessed as being similar to, or slightly less than that of [[diazepam]] and it would also be expected to be somewhat safer due to its relatively weaker sedative effects,<ref>de Wit H, Vicini L, Haig GM, Hunt T, Feltner D.
