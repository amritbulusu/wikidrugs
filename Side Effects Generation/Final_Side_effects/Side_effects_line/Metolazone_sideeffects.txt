Metolazone and the other thiazide diuretics inhibit the function of the sodium-chloride symporter, preventing sodium and chloride, and therefore water too, from leaving the lumen to enter the tubule cell. As a result, water remains in the lumen and is excreted as urine, instead of being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Since most of the sodium in the lumen has already been reabsorbed by the time the filtrate reaches the distal convoluted tubule, thiazide diuretics have limited effects on water balance and on [[electrolyte]] levels.<ref name="G&G" /> Nevertheless, they can be associated with [[hyponatremia|low sodium levels]], [[volume depletion]], and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], among other adverse effects.

 
Metolazone may also be used in renal (kidney) disease, such as [[chronic renal failure]] or the [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Chronic renal failure causes excess fluid retention that is often treated with [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] adjustments and diuretics.<ref name="Harrison's" /> Metolazone may be combined with other diuretics (typically loop diuretics) to treat diuretic resistance in CHF, chronic renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome.<ref name="CDT">Rosenberg J, Gustafsson F, Galatius S, & Hildebrandt PR. "Combination therapy with metolazone and loop diuretics in outpatients with refractory heart failure: an observational study and review of the literature." ''[[Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy]]''. 2005 Aug;19(4):301-6. {{PMID|16189620}}.</ref> Metolazone and a loop diuretic will synergistically enhance diuresis over the use of either agent alone. Using this combination, diuretic effects will occur at two different segments of the nephron; namely, the loop diuretic will act at the [[loop of Henle]], and metolazone will act at the distal convoluted tubule. Metolazone is frequently prescribed in addition to the loop diuretic. Metolazone may be used for edema caused by liver [[cirrhosis]] as well.

 
Since thiazide diuretics affect the transport of [[electrolyte]]s and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal of too much fluid can cause [[volume depletion]] and [[hypotension]]. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including [[hyponatremia]] (low sodium), [[hypokalemia]] (low potassium), [[hypochloremia]] (low chloride), [[hypomagnesemia]] (low [[magnesium]]), [[hypercalcemia]] (high [[calcium]]), and [[hyperuricemia]] (high [[uric acid]]). These may result in [[dizziness]], [[headache]], or heart [[arrhythmia]]s (palpitations).<ref name="G&G" /> Serious, though rare, side effects include [[aplastic anemia]], [[pancreatitis]], [[agranulocytosis]], and [[angioedema]]. Metolazone, like other thiazide diuretics, may unmask latent [[diabetes mellitus]] or exacerbate [[gout]], especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, are [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides ("sulfa allergy") may also be allergic to metolazone.<ref name="G&G" />
