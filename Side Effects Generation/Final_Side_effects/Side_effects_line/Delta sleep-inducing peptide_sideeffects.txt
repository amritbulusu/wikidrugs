*There is also conflicting evidence as to its involvement in sleep patterns.

*Due to its possible effects on sleep and nociception, trials have been carried out to determine whether DSIP can be used as an [[anaesthetic]].  One such study found that administration of DSIP to humans as an adjunct to [[isoflurane]] anaesthesia actually increased the heart rate and reduced the depth of anaesthesia instead of deepening it as expected.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/EJA.0b013e32831c8644 |vauthors=Pomfrett CJ, Dolling S, Anders NR, Glover DG, Bryan A, Pollard BJ | title = Delta sleep-inducing peptide alters bispectral index, the electroencephalogram and heart rate variability when used as an adjunct to isoflurane anaesthesia | journal = Eur J Anaesthesiol  | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 128–34 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19142086}}</ref>

Safety and possible side-effects of long-term DSIP use haven't been established in clinical research studies.
