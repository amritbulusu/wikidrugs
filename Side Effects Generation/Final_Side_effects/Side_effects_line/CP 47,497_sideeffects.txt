On the 19th of January 2009, the University of Freiburg in Germany announced that an [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of CP 47,497 is the main active ingredient in the herbal "incense" product [[Spice (drug)|Spice]], specifically the 1,1-dimethyloctyl [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of CP 47,497. Both the dimethylheptyl and dimethyloctyl homologues were detected in different batches, with considerable variation in the concentration present in different samples that were analysed. The weaker dimethylhexyl and dimethylnonyl homologues were not found in any batches of smoking blends tested, but have been legally scheduled alongside the others in some jurisdictions, to forestall any potential use for this purpose.<ref>Hauptwirkstoff von „Spice“ identifiziert, University of Freiburg http://www.pr.uni-freiburg.de/pm/2009/pm.2009-01-19.19/</ref><ref>Spice - weitere Analyseresultate http://www.basg.at/servlet/sls/Tornado/web/ages/content/4E5A4B86295BF5C0C125753E006A5E3C</ref><ref>Auwärter V, ''et al.''
