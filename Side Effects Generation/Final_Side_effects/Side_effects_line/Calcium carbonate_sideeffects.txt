The main use of calcium carbonate is in the construction industry, either as a building material or limestone aggregate for road building or as an ingredient of cement or as the starting material for the preparation of builder's lime by burning in a kiln. However, because of weathering mainly caused by [[acid rain]],<ref>{{cite web|title = Effects of Acid Rain|publisher = US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate = 14 March 2015|url = http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/materials.html}}</ref> calcium carbonate (in limestone form) is no longer used for building purposes on its own, but only as a raw/primary substance for building materials.

 
Excess calcium from supplements, fortified food and high-calcium diets, can cause [[milk-alkali syndrome]], which has serious toxicity and can be fatal. In 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced the "Sippy regimen" of hourly ingestion of milk and cream, and the gradual addition of eggs and cooked cereal, for 10 days, combined with alkaline powders, which provided symptomatic relief for peptic ulcer disease. Over the next several decades, the Sippy regimen resulted in [[renal failure]], [[alkalosis]], and [[hypercalcaemia]], mostly in men with peptic ulcer disease. These adverse effects were reversed when the regimen stopped, but it was fatal in some patients with protracted vomiting. Milk-alkali syndrome declined in men after effective treatments for [[peptic ulcer]] disease arose. During the past 15 years, it has been reported in women taking calcium supplements above the recommended range of 1.2 to 1.5&nbsp;g daily, for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and is exacerbated by [[dehydration]]. Calcium has been added to over-the-counter products, which contributes to inadvertent excessive intake. Excessive calcium intake can lead to [[hypercalcemia]], complications of which include vomiting, abdominal pain and altered mental status.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Clinical problem-solving, back to basics|author=Gabriely, Ilan |journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2008|volume=358|pmid=18450607|doi=10.1056/NEJMcps0706188|issue=18|last2=Leu|first2=James P.|last3=Barzel|first3=Uriel S.|pages=1952–6}}</ref>

 
 Limestone Dispenser Fights Acid Rain in Stream |date=13 June 1989|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD9173FF930A25755C0A96F948260|work = The New York Times}}</ref> His hope was that the calcium carbonate would counter the acid in the stream from acid rain and save the trout that had ceased to spawn. Although his experiment was a success, it did increase the amount of aluminium ions in the area of the brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that CaCO<sub>3</sub> can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in [[river]] ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water.<ref name=env>{{cite web|title=Environmental Uses for Calcium Carbonate|url=http://www.congcal.com/markets/environmental/|publisher=Congcal|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author = Schreiber, R.

The trends are illustrative for pool management, but whether scaling occurs also depends on other factors including interactions with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, B(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> and other ions in the pool, as well as supersaturation effects.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wojtowicz, J.
