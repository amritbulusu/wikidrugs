== Side effects ==

 
Reported side effects include injection site reactions, [[rash]], and rarely [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]]. Gastrointestinal side effects generally include [[diarrhea]] and [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. There may be drug-induced [[eosinophilia]]. Because of the unfused beta-lactam ring unique to aztreonam, there is somewhat lower cross-reactivity between aztreonam and many other [[beta-lactam]] antibiotics, and it may be safe to administer aztreonam to many patients with hypersensitivity (allergies) to penicillins and nearly all [[cephalosporin]]s.<ref name="AHFS" /> However, like other beta lactams, there is a risk of very serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.  The aztreonam label directs physicians to be aware of the possibility of these severe adverse reactions.   This is more likely if the patient is allergic to a certain cephalosporin known as [[ceftazidime]]. Azetreonam exhibits cross-reactivity with this cephalosporin due to a similar side chain.  Physicians should evaluate prior allergy history when prescribing this medicine.
