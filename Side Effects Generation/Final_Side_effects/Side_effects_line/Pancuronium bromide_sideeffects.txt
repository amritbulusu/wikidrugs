Pancuronium is a typical [[depolarization|non-depolarizing]] [[curare]]-mimetic [[muscle relaxant]]. It [[Competitive inhibition|competitively inhibits]] the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] at the [[neuromuscular junction]] by blocking the binding of [[acetylcholine]]. It has slight [[vagus nerve|vagolytic]] activity, causing an increase in heart rate,  but no [[ganglioplegic]] (i.e., blocking [[ganglion]]s) activity. It is a very potent muscle relaxant drug, with an [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|ED95]] (i.e., the dose that causes 95% depression of muscle twitch response) of only 60&nbsp;µg/kg body weight. Onset of action is relatively slow compared to other similar drugs, in part due to its low dose - an intubating dose takes 3–6 minutes for full effect. Clinical effects (muscle activity lower than 25% of physiological) last for about 100 minutes. The time needed for full (over 90% muscle activity) recovery after single administration is about 120–180 minutes in healthy adults. 

 
The effects of pancuronium can be at least partially reversed by [[cholinesterase inhibitor|anticholinesterasics]], such as [[neostigmine]], [[pyridostigmine]], and [[edrophonium]].

 
Pancuronium is used with [[general anesthesia]] in surgery for muscle relaxation and as an aid to [[intubation]] or ventilation. It does not have [[sedative]] or [[analgesic]] effects.

 
[[Adverse effect (medicine)|Side-effects]] include moderately raised [[heart rate]] and thereby [[arterial pressure]] and cardiac output, excessive [[saliva]]tion, [[apnea]] and [[respiratory depression]], [[rash]]es, [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], and [[sweating]].{{medcn|date=January 2016}} The muscular relaxation can be dangerous in the seriously ill and it can accumulate leading to extended weakness. Pancuronium is not preferable in long-term use in ICU-ventilated patients.
