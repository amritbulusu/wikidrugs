'''Phenindamine''' ('''Nolahist''', '''Thephorin''') is an [[antihistamine]] and [[anticholinergic]] closely related to [[cyproheptadine]]. It was developed by [[Hoffman-La Roche]] in the late 1940s.<ref>US Patent 2546652 - Pyridindenes and process for their manufacture</ref> It is used to treat symptoms of the [[common cold]] and [[allergies]], such as sneezing, itching, rashes, and [[hives]]. Its efficacy against some symptoms of opioid withdrawal was researched in the 1950s and 1960s in a number of countries; [[William S. Burroughs]]' book ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'' mentions this technique. Like many other first-generation antihistamines, phenindamine has useful potentiating effects on many narcotic analgesics and is even more useful with those opioids which release histamine when in the body.
