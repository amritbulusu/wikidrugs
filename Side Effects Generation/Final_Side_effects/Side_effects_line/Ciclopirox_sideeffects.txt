In contrast to the [[azole]]s and other antimycotic drugs, the [[mechanism of action]] of ciclopirox is poorly understood.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Niewerth M, Kunze D, Seibold M, Schaller M, Korting HC, Hube B | title = Ciclopirox Olamine Treatment Affects the Expression Pattern of Candida albicans Genes Encoding Virulence Factors, Iron Metabolism Proteins, and Drug Resistance Factors | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |date=June 2003 | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1805–17 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.6.1805-1817.2003 | pmid = 12760852 | pmc = 155814}}</ref>  However, loss of function of certain [[catalase]] and [[peroxidase]] enzymes has been implicated as the mechanism of action, as well as various other components of cellular metabolism. In a study conducted to further elucidate ciclopirox's mechanism, several ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' mutants were screened and tested. Results from interpretation of the effects of both the drug treatment and mutation suggested that ciclopirox may exert its effect by disrupting DNA repair, cell division signals and structures (mitotic spindles) as well as some elements of intracellular transport.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leem SH, Park JE, Kim IS, Chae JY, Sugino A, Sunwoo Y |title=The possible mechanism of action of ciclopirox olamine in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Mol.
