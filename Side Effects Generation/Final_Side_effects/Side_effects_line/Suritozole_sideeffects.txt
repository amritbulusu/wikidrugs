'''Suritozole''' ('''MDL 26,479''') is an investigational [[cognition enhancer]]. It acts as a partial [[inverse agonist]] at the [[benzodiazepine receptor]] site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> ion channel complex, but does not have either [[anxiogenic]] or [[convulsant]] effects, unlike other BZD inverse agonists such as [[DMCM]].<ref name="pmid1330168">{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller JA, Dudley MW, Kehne JH, Sorensen SM, Kane JM |title=MDL 26,479: a potential cognition enhancer with benzodiazepine inverse agonist-like properties |journal=Br.
