'''Butyrfentanyl''' or '''butyrylfentanyl''' is a potent short-acting synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] [[medication|drug]].  It is an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[fentanyl]] with around one quarter of its potency. One of the first mentions of this drug can be found in document written by The College on Problem of Drug Dependence, where it is mentioned as ''N''-butyramide fentanyl analog.<ref name="The College on Problem of Drug Dependence">[http://www.cpdd.vcu.edu/DEC_ARCHIVES/DEC/acrobat/DECindices.pdf The College on Problem of Drug Dependence], Foreword to the Drug Evaluation Committee (DEC) Analgesic, Stimulant, and Depressant Drug Indices</ref> This document also states that the article describing its clinical effects (analgesic studies, μ-, δ-, κ-opioid receptor binding, and ''[[in vitro]]'' measures of drug efficacy, antinociceptive, and narcotic properties) was published in 1987. It is an agonist for the [[μ-opioid receptor]]s.<ref name="Part II">[http://content.lib.utah.edu/utils/getfile/collection/etd1/id/1285/filename/1341.pdf Utilization of a radioreceptor assay for the analysis of fentanyl analogs in urine] Mario Enrique Alburges</ref>

 
Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]], and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]] which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959%2815%2900097-3/abstract | title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?
