Brofaromine also acts as a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]], and its dual pharmacologic effects offered promise in the treatment of a wide spectrum of depressed patients while producing less severe [[anticholinergic]] side effects in comparison with older standard drugs like the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.

 
Brofaromine is a [[reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A]] (RIMA, a type of [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI)) and acts on [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), [[serotonin]], and [[dopamine]]. Unlike standard MAOIs, possible side effects do not include [[cardiovascular]] complications ([[hypertension]]) with [[encephalopathy]], [[Hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]] or [[hyperthermia]].
