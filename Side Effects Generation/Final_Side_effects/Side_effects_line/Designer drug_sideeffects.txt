A '''designer drug''' is a [[structural analog|structural]] or [[Functional analog (chemistry)|functional analog]] of a [[controlled substance]] that has been designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug, while avoiding classification as illegal and/or detection in standard [[drug test]]s.<ref name="pmid21083227">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wohlfarth A, Weinmann W | title = Bioanalysis of new designer drugs | journal = Bioanalysis | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–79 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21083227 | doi = 10.4155/bio.10.32 }}</ref> Designer drugs include [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] that have been designated by the [[European Union]] as '''new psychoactive substances''' ('''NPS''')<ref name="urlNew Psychoactive Substances (NPS) | Drug War Facts">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/chapter/NPS#sthash.rL4NWCVl.dpbs | title = New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) | publisher = Common Sense for Drug Policy | work = Drug War Facts | quote = The term 'new psychoactive substances' had been legally defined by the European Union as a new narcotic or psychotropic drug, in pure form or in a preparation, that is not scheduled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 or the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, but which may pose a public health threat comparable to that posed by substances listed in those conventions (Council of the European Union decision 2005/387/JHA).}}</ref> as well as analogs of [[performance-enhancing drugs]] such as '''designer steroids'''.<ref name="pmid22191595">{{cite journal | vauthors = Teale P, Scarth J, Hudson S | title = Impact of the emergence of designer drugs upon sports doping testing | journal = Bioanalysis | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–88 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22191595 | doi = 10.4155/bio.11.291 }}</ref> Some of these were originally synthesized by academic or industrial researchers in an effort to discover more potent derivatives with fewer side effects and were later co-opted for recreational use.

The development of designer drugs may be considered a subfield of [[drug design]]. The exploration of modifications to known active drugs—such as their [[structural analogue]]s, [[stereoisomer]]s, and [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]]—yields drugs that may differ significantly in effects from their "parent" drug (e.g., showing increased potency, or decreased [[side effects]]).<ref name="pmid22092008"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Buchanan JF, Brown CR | title = 'Designer drugs'. A problem in clinical toxicology | journal = Med Toxicol Adverse Drug Exp | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–17 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3285124 | doi = 10.1007/bf03259928 }}</ref> In some instances, designer drugs have similar effects to other known drugs, but have completely dissimilar chemical structures (e.g. [[JWH-018]] vs [[THC]]). Despite being a very broad term, applicable to almost every synthetic drug, it is often used to connote synthetic recreational drugs, sometimes even those which have not been designed at all (e.g. LSD, the psychedelic side effects of which were discovered unintentionally).

 
Following the passage of the second [[International Opium Convention]] in 1925, which specifically banned [[morphine]], the [[acetyl|diacetyl]] [[ester]] of morphine, [[heroin]], and a number of alternative esters of morphine quickly started to be manufactured and sold. The most notable of these were [[dibenzoylmorphine]] and [[acetylpropionylmorphine]], which have virtually identical effects to heroin but were not covered by the Opium Convention. This then led the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] to pass several resolutions attempting to bring these new drugs under control, ultimately leading in 1930 to the first broad analogues provisions extending legal control to all esters of morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1953-01-01_2_page009.html | title = Esters of Morphine | journal = UNODC Bulletin on Narcotics | year = 1953 | issue = 2 | pages = 36–38}}</ref> Another early example of what could loosely be termed designer drug use, was during the [[Prohibition]] era in the 1930s, when [[diethyl ether]] was sold and used as an alternative to illegal [[alcoholic beverage]]s in a number of countries.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brecher | first = Edward M. | title = The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs | publisher = Consumer Reports Magazine. | year = 1972 | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>

 
Mephedrone and the [[cathinone]]s marked somewhat of a turning point for designer drugs, turning them from little known, ineffective substances sold in [[head shops]] to powerful substances able to compete with classical drugs on the black market. Mephedrone especially experienced a somewhat meteoric rise in popularity in 2009<ref name=Measham>{{cite journal | last1 = Measham | first1 = F. | first2 = K. | last2 = Moore | first3 = R. | last3 = Newcombe | first4 = Z. | last4 = Smith | name-list-format = vanc | date=12 March 2010|title=Tweaking, bombing, dabbing and stockpiling: the emergence of mephedrone and the perversity of prohibition |journal=Drugs and Alcohol Today|volume=10|issue=1|pages=14–21|doi=10.5042/daat.2010.0123}}{{subscription}}</ref> and the resulting media panic resulted in its prohibition in multiple countries, including, unusually, China. Following this there was a considerable emergence of other cathinones which attempted to mimic the effects of mephedrone, and with a newly attracted customer base, plenty of money to drive innovation.

 
The safety of research chemicals is untested and little if any research has been done on the [[toxicology]] or pharmacology of most of these drugs. Few, if any, human or [[animal studies]] have been done. Many research compounds have produced unexpected side-effects and adverse incidents due to the lack of screening for off-target effects prior to marketing; both [[bromo-dragonfly]] and [[mephedrone]] seem to be capable of producing pronounced [[vasoconstriction]] under some circumstances, which has resulted in several deaths,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreasen MF, Telving R, Birkler RI, Schumacher B, Johannsen M | title = A fatal poisoning involving Bromo-Dragonfly | journal = Forensic Sci.

[[Substituted phenethylamine]]s such as the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]] and [[substituted amphetamine]]s such as the [[DOx|DOx family]] have also caused a limited number of deaths.
