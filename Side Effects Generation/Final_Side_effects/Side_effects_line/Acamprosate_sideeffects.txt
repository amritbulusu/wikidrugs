Current studies have not shown any serious drug-drug interactions between acamprosate and alcohol, [[diazepam]], [[imipramine]], or [[disulfiram]].<ref name="ClinicalPK"/> One study found that giving acamprosate with [[naltrexone]] had no harmful effects and no clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of either drugs.<ref name=MasonPKPD>{{cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=BJ|last2=Goodman|first2=AM|last3=Dixon|first3=RM|last4=Hameed|first4=MH|last5=Hulot|first5=T|last6=Wesnes|first6=K|last7=Hunter|first7=JA|last8=Boyeson|first8=MG|title=A pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interaction study of acamprosate and naltrexone|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=Oct 2002|volume=27|issue=4|pages=596–606|pmid=12377396|doi=10.1016/s0893-133x(02)00368-8}}</ref>

 
The [[mechanism of action]] of acamprosate is unknown and controversial.<ref name="ReillyLobo2008">{{cite journal|last1=Reilly|first1=Matthew T.|last2=Lobo|first2=Ingrid A.|last3=McCracken|first3=Lindsay M.|last4=Borghese|first4=Cecilia M.|last5=Gong|first5=Diane|last6=Horishita|first6=Takafumi|last7=Adron Harris|first7=R.|title=Effects of Acamprosate on Neuronal Receptors and Ion Channels Expressed inXenopusOocytes|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=32|issue=2|year=2008|pages=188–196|issn=0145-6008|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2007.00569.x}}</ref> At high concentrations, well above those that occur clinically (1–3 μM), reports of inhibition of [[glutamate receptor]]-activated responses (1 mM), enhancement of [[NMDA receptor]] function (300 μM), weak [[receptor antagonist|antagonization]] of the NMDA receptor, [[partial agonism]] of the [[polyamine]] site of the NMDA receptor, and possible inhibition of the [[mGluR1]] and [[mGluR5]] (10 μM) have all been published.<ref name="ReillyLobo2008" /> However, no direct action of acamprosate at clinically-relevant concentrations has yet been reported. Moreover, a subsequent study found no action of acamprosate on the mGluR1 or mGluR5 at concentrations as high as 100 μM, nor at [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] or [[glycine receptor]]s or [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s.<ref name="ReillyLobo2008" />

 
Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on the central nervous system by binding to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., it is a positive allosteric modulator). In chronic alcohol abuse, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. becoming generally less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the GABA system). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect; compounded with the fact that GABA normally inhibits action potential formation, there are not as many receptors for GABA to bind to — meaning that excitatory neurotransmission is unopposed, leading to over-excitation. Acamprosate's mechanism of action is supposed to be, at least partially, due to an enhancement effect on GABA receptors. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control [[tinnitus]], hyperacusis, ear pain and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

 
In addition, alcohol also inhibits the activity of [[NMDA receptor|''N''-methyl-<small>D</small>-aspartate receptors]] (NMDARs). Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction ([[upregulation]]) of these receptors. Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of [[delirium tremens]] and [[excitotoxicity|excitotoxic]] neuronal death.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tsai | first1 = G | last2 = Coyle | first2 = JT | title = The role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of alcoholism | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 49 | pages = 173–84 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9509257 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.49.1.173 }}</ref> [[Drug withdrawal|Withdrawal]] from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory [[neurotransmitter]]s like [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], which activates NMDARs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tsai | first1 = GE | last2 = Ragan | first2 = P | last3 = Chang | first3 = R | last4 = Chen | first4 = S | last5 = Linnoila | first5 = VM | last6 = Coyle | first6 = JT | title = Increased glutamatergic neurotransmission and oxidative stress after alcohol withdrawal | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/155/6/726 | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 155 | issue = 6 | pages = 726–32 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9619143 }}</ref> Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge.<ref name="De Witte 2005">{{cite journal | last1 = De Witte | first1 = P | last2 = Littleton | first2 = J | last3 = Parot | first3 = P | last4 = Koob | first4 = G | title = Neuroprotective and abstinence-promoting effects of acamprosate: elucidating the mechanism of action | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 517–37 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15963001 | doi=10.2165/00023210-200519060-00004}}</ref> The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by [[ethanol withdrawal]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = S | last2 = Harris | first2 = BR | last3 = Gibson | first3 = DA | last4 = Blanchard | first4 = JA | last5 = Prendergast | first5 = MA | last6 = Holley | first6 = RC | last7 = Littleton | first7 = J | title = Acamprosate, MK-801, and ifenprodil inhibit neurotoxicity and calcium entry induced by ethanol withdrawal in organotypic slice cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1468–78 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12394279 | doi = 10.1097/01.ALC.0000033261.14548.D2 }}</ref> and from glutamate exposure combined with ethanol withdrawal.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Al Qatari | first1 = M | last2 = Khan | first2 = S | last3 = Harris | first3 = B | last4 = Littleton | first4 = J | title = Acamprosate is neuroprotective against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity when enhanced by ethanol withdrawal in neocortical cultures of fetal rat brain | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 1276–83 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11584146 | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2001.tb02348.x }}</ref>

 
In contrast to the aforementioned wide array of purported mechanisms of action, a 2013 profile animal study published in ''[[Neuropsychopharmacology (journal)|Neuropsychopharmacology]]''<ref name=Spanagel2014>{{cite journal |vauthors=Spanagel R, Vengeliene V, Jandeleit B, Fischer WN, Grindstaff K, Zhang X, Gallop MA, Krstew EV, Lawrence AJ, Kiefer F |title=Acamprosate produces its anti-relapse effects via calcium. |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology. |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=783–791 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24081303 |doi=10.1038/npp.2013.264 |url=}}</ref> suggests that acamprosate has by itself no psychotropic profile, no [[NMDA receptor|''N''-methyl-<small>D</small>-aspartate receptor]] or [[metabotropic glutamate receptor 5]] activity, and that therapeutic effects are due to the active calcium moiety co-administered with the acamprosate salt form. These findings have not yet been reproduced.

 
===Neuroprotective effects===

 
In addition to its apparent ability to help patients refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that acamprosate is [[neuroprotection|neuroprotective]] (that is, it protects [[neuron]]s from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, and possibly other causes of [[neurotoxicity]]).<ref name="De Witte 2005"/><ref name=MannReview>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mann K, Kiefer F, Spanagel R, Littleton J |title=Acamprosate: recent findings and future research directions |journal=Alcohol.
