==Efficacy and side-effects==

 
Batroxobin could be used as a [[medical adhesive]] against bleeding injuries. A study was done, where researchers aimed to examine the effects of batroxobin-containing adhesive for hemostasis. The fibrinogen conversion ability of batroxobin was evaluated by a fibrinogen clotting assay and a whole blood clotting assay. Both results proved that batroxobin containing adhesive forms blood clots. Higher concentrations of batroxobin more rapidly induced hemostasis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=You, K.E. |year=2014 |title=The effective control of a bleeding injury using a medical adhesive containing batroxobin |journal=Biomed Mater |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=1748-6041|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Another study has tested the effects of 2 units of batroxobin on perioperative blood loss and coagulation in patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), while undergoing a hip replacement. This is done by giving 240 patients LMWH, 12 hours previously to the hip operation. These patients were randomly divided into a testing group (120 patients) and a control group (120 patients). The testing group and the control group received 2 units of batroxobin and 50&nbsp;mg mannitol respectively 10 minutes before incision. There is tested on perioperative blood loss, postoperative 24 drainage and blood routine test, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen. The study showed that the perioperative blood loss in the test group was 422,64 mL, which is less than the 667,67 mL blood loss of the control group. Red blood cell, hemoglobin and red blood cell volume and platelet were decreasing after the operation in both groups, but not significant different between the two groups. Also were there no drug-related adverse effects found in both groups, nor were there differences found in hospitalization between the two groups. The study concludes that 2 units of batroxobin could reduce the perioperative blood loss in patients getting a hip replacement operation with LMWH.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ding, G. |year=2014 |title=[Effects of batroxobin on perioperative blood loss and coagulation in patients with low molecular weight heparin when undergoing the total hip replacement] |journal=Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=737–40|display-authors=etal}}</ref> There has also been studies done to examine the effects of batroxobin with continuous transcranial doppler monitoring in patients with acute cerebral stroke. The aim was to find out whether the effect of continuous transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring could be increased by the use of batroxobin on patients suffering from an acute cerebral stroke beyond the thrombolytic time window. In this study 90 patients were analyzed within twelve hours of the beginning of the symptoms. The patient were divided into a target and a control group which respectively got batroxobin with and without one hour of continuous TCD monitoring. Clinical sereneness of the strokes were based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Barthel index (BI), Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia score (TIBI), the incidence of advancing stroke, and the recurrence of cerebral infarction. The target group showed a significant better NIHSS score 57 days after the treatment, when compared with the control group. Also the incidence of advancing stroke one week afterwards and the incidence of stroke iteration after three months were significantly reduced in the target group. Safety of TCD monitoring in the clinical use for the groups was confirmed because no significant difference between the groups of the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage had shown one week after the use of TCD monitoring. The study concludes that the use of batroxobin combined with continuous TCD monitoring reduced the chance of advancing stroke and stroke recurrence after the treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yitao, H. |year=2014 |title=Effects of batroxobin with continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring in patients with acute cerebral stroke: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Echocardiography |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1283–92|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1111/echo.12559}}</ref>

 
===Adverse effects===

 
The effects of batroxobin from different species are slightly different. There will be an overview of two different snakes, ''Bothrops atrox'' and ''Bothrops moojeni''. When injected with batroxobin there will be major symptoms affecting the hemostatic system. Batroxobin from ''Bothrops atrox'' mediates the formation of fibrin I. This then renders the blood more prone to coagulation.<ref name="Serrano">{{cite journal |author=Serrano, S.M.T. |year=2013 |title=The long road of research on snake venom serine proteinases |journal=Toxicon |volume=62 |issue=0 |pages=19–26 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.09.003 |pmid=23010164}}</ref> An overdose will lead to excessive blood-clotting, which can result in bleeding due to damage to blood vessels or even thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The clots can also cause secondary organ damage, such as renal damage or intracerebral hemorrhage.<ref name="Yonamine">{{cite book |author1 =Yonamine, C.M. |author2 =Á.R.d.B.P.d. Silva |author3 =G.S. Magalhães |year=2013 |chapter=Serine proteases – Cloning, Expression and Potential Applications |title=An Integrated View of the Molecular Recognition and Toxinology - From Analytical Procedures to Biomedical Applications}}</ref> If the dose is high enough this will eventually lead to death. In the case of batroxobin from the ''Bothrops moojeni'' also formation of fibrin I is mediated, however there is also a release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). This results in a rapid degradation of fibrin I and a lowered fibrinogen concentration. Which leads to a reduction of blood viscosity and blood coagulability.<ref name="Serrano"/> The blood is thinner and there is an increased tendency to bleed and to leak blood. Hypovolemic shock could occur. This shock can cause organs to stop working and eventually lead to death.<ref name="Yonamine"/>

 
==Effects on animals==

 
===Single-dose effects===

 
===Long-term effects===

 
The long-term effects of batroxobin are tested on rats and ''Macaca mulatta''. The subjects received an injection of batroxobin once a day for 30 consecutive days. In rats the batroxobin had pharmacological and toxicological effects on the hematology system and liver. There was a decrease of fibrinogen. The effects were reversible.<ref name="Guan-Ren_2008"/> In ''Macaca mulatta'', the fibrinogen concentration was significantly decreased and the decrease was dose-dependent. There was a local inflammatory reaction in the injection sites of the animals. After 15 days there were antibodies to batroxobin detected. The conclusion was that batroxobin has pharmacological and toxicological effects on the hematology system of ''Macaca mulatta'' and the effects are reversible.<ref name="Guo-cai"/>
