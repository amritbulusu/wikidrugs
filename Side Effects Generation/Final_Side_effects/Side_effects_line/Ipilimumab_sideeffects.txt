== Adverse effects ==

 
Ipilimumab treatment has been associated with severe and potentially fatal immunological adverse effects due to [[T cell activation]] and proliferation; these occur in 10-20% of people and are a major drawback of this drug.<ref name=2015TherAdvRev>{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson DB, Peng C, Sosman JA |title=Nivolumab in melanoma: latest evidence and clinical potential |journal=Ther Adv Med Oncol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=97–106 |year=2015 |pmid=25755682 |pmc=4346215 |doi=10.1177/1758834014567469 |url=}}</ref>  Most of the serious adverse effects are associated with the [[gastro-intestinal tract]]; they include stomach pain, bloating, constipation or diarrhea, but also fever, breathing or urinating problems.

Sequencing and [[epitope]] prediction algorithms identified neoantigens in mouse tumors that functioned as tumor-specific T cell targets. Neoantigens were recognized by T cells in melanoma patients and were likely the major contributor to positive clinical effects of [[adoptive cell transfer]]. Mouse models established that neoantigens were the targets of T cells activated by checkpoint blockade therapy and that synthetic long [[peptides]] comprising these neoantigens were effective when administered as vaccines with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 mAbs. Cancers with higher mutation burdens, and an associated likelihood of expressing neoantigens, appear most likely to respond to checkpoint therapy. In melanoma and certain other cancers, the numbers of mutations and neoantigens correlate with patient response. Increased PD ligand 2 (PD-L2) transcript expression and an immune “cytolytic” gene signature also correlated with neoantigen load and tumor response. CTLA-4 expression  was a response indicator, which along with PD-L2 were likely expressed in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. An inflamed TME prior to treatment is also associated with response.<ref name=":1" />

 
On December 10, 2007, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Medarex released the results of three studies on ipilimumab for melanoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medarex.com/cgi-local/item.pl/20071210-1085876 |title=Top-Line Data Available from Three Ipilimumab Pivotal Trials in Patients with Advanced Metastatic Melanoma |date=2007-12-10 |publisher=Medarex, Inc. |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020042102/http://www.medarex.com/cgi-local/item.pl/20071210-1085876 |archivedate=October 20, 2008 }}</ref> The three studies tested 487 patients with advanced skin cancer. One of the three studies failed to meet its primary goal of shrinking tumors in at least 10.0% of the study's 155 patients. <!-- Side effects are often considered acceptable risks for cancer drugs given the severity of the disease, and ipilimumab is no exception.--> Side effects included rashes, diarrhea, and hepatitis. <!-- Despite the weaker-than-anticipated results, the companies are still planning to meet with regulatory agencies to discuss moving ahead with the medication since patients suffering from extremely serious diseases like melanoma have so few treatment options, the companies believe that even the marginal success rate will be appealing to some. -->

 
In March 2014, an open-label, randomized, two agent, single center trial started combining ipilimumab with [[phosphatidylserine]]-targeting immunotherapy [[bavituximab]] for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The number of treated patients in arm A (ipilimumab plus bavituximab) was to be 16, with 8 in arm B (ipilimumab only). The trial was expected to complete in March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Two-arm, Single Center Phase 1b Trial of Bavituximab Plus Ipilimumab in Advanced Melanoma Patients|publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01984255?term=bavituximab&rank=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Peregrine Pharmaceuticals Announces Initiation of an Investigator-Sponsored Trial Combining Its Immunotherapy Bavituximab and Ipilimumab (Yervoy®) in Advanced Melanoma|publisher=Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc|url=http://ir.peregrineinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=841892}}</ref> Previous, preclinical studies showed that PS targeting antibodies (such as bavituximab) enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies.

Bluestone and Linsley separately studied the similarities between CD28 and CTLA-4. Bluestone’s lab published studies, one together with Krummel and Allison, for ''in vitro'' studies of CTLA-4 function.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Walunas T.L. |author2=Bakker C.Y. |author3=Bluestone J.A. | year = 1996 | title = CTLA-4 ligation blocks CD28-dependent T cell activation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 183 | issue = 6| pages = 2541–2550 | doi=10.1084/jem.183.6.2541 | pmid=8676075 | pmc=2192609}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Walunas T.L. |author2=Lenschow D.J. |author3=Bakker C.Y. |author4=Linsley P.S. |author5=Freeman G.J. |author6=Green J.M. |author7=Thompson C.B. |author8=Bluestone J.A. | year = 1994 | title = CTLA-4 can function as a negative regulator of T cell activation | url = | journal = Immunity | volume = 1 | issue = 5| pages = 405–413 | doi=10.1016/1074-7613(94)90071-x | pmid=7882171}}</ref> In collaboration with Mark Jenkins, they were able to see effects of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies ''in vivo'' in an immunization setting,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kearney E.R. |author2=Walunas T.L. |author3=Karr R.W. |author4=Morton P.A. |author5=Loh D.Y. |author6=Bluestone J.A. |author7=Jenkins M.K. | year = 1995 | title = Antigen-dependent clonal expansion of a trace population of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in vivo is dependent on CD28 costimulation and inhibited by CTLA-4 | url = | journal = J Immunol | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 1032–1036 }}</ref> but did not effectively carry this into tumor biology.
