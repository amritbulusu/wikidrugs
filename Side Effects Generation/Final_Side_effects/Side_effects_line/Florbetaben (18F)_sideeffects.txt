Florbetaben PET imaging showed strong tracer accumulation in the anatomically matched brain regions confirmed to have β-amyloid plaques by postmortem histopathology, thus providing direct target validation for florbetaben. Evaluation of whole brain florbetaben PET images using the clinically applicable visual assessment method demonstrated that florbetaben provides good diagnostic efficacy in detecting/excluding cerebral neuritic β-amyloid plaques. Sensitivity and specificity of the whole brain assessment was 98 and 89%, respectively, against the histopathological standard of truth. Good agreement between blinded readers (kappa 0.90) was reported. Furthermore, high negative and positive predictive values were reported for florbetaben imaging to exclude or detect β-amyloid plaques (negative predictive value 96.0% and positive predictive value 93.9%, see <ref name=Sabri />). Intravenous injections of florbetaben are generally well tolerated in all subject groups. Analysis of 872 patients with 978 florbetaben administrations found no serious adverse reactions related to the tracer.<ref name=US /> All adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate in severity and temporary only. The most common reactions (incidence < 1%) were injection-site pain (3.9% of patients), injection-site erythema (1.7%) and injection-site irritation (1.2%).<ref name=US /> There was no overall difference in the tolerability of florbetaben between different age populations.<ref name=US /> Repeated annual florbetaben injections showed no differences in the tolerability profile.<ref name=EU /> Risks and side effects are addressed in the patient information leaflet.<ref name=US /><ref name=EU /> You may also ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information.
