Consistent with its hypothesized role as “endogenous amphetamine,” β-PEA was shown to possess reinforcing properties, a defining feature that underlies the abuse liability of amphetamine and other psychomotor stimulants. β-PEA was also as effective as amphetamine in its ability to produce conditioned place preference (i.e., the process by which an organism learns an association between drug effects and a particular place or context) in rats (Gilbert and Cooper, 1983) and was readily self-administered by dogs that had a stable history (i.e., consisting of early acquisition and later maintenance) of amphetamine or cocaine self-administration (Risner and Jones, 1977; Shannon and Thompson, 1984). In another study, high concentrations of β-PEA dose-dependently maintained responding in monkeys that were previously trained to self-administer cocaine, and pretreatment with a MAO-B inhibitor, which delayed β-PEA deactivation, further increased response rates (Bergman et al., 2001).}}</ref><br />Moderate (with an MAO-B inhibitor)<ref name="TAAR1 and TA pharmacology 2016 review" />

 
Many substituted phenethylamines are psychoactive drugs which belong to a variety of different drug classes, including [[central nervous system stimulant]]s (e.g., [[amphetamine]]), [[hallucinogen]]s (e.g., [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine]]), [[entactogen]]s (e.g., [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]]), [[appetite suppressant]]s (e.g. [[phentermine]]), [[nasal decongestant]]s and [[bronchodilator]]s (e.g., [[pseudoephedrine]]), [[antidepressant]]s (e.g. [[bupropion]]), [[antiparkinson agent]]s (e.g., [[selegiline]]), and [[vasopressor]]s (e.g., [[ephedrine]]), among others. Many of these psychoactive compounds exert their pharmacological effects primarily by modulating [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] systems; however, there is no mechanism of action or biological target that is common to all members of this subclass.

 
Thirty minutes of moderate to high intensity physical exercise has been shown to induce an enormous increase in urinary [[phenylacetic acid]], the primary metabolite of phenethylamine.<ref name="Renaissance">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindemann L, Hoener MC | title = A renaissance in trace amines inspired by a novel GPCR family | journal = Trends Pharmacol.

In addition to the various beneficial effects for brain function mainly attributed to an upregulation of peptide growth factors [52,53], exercise induces a rapidly enhanced excretion of the main β-PEA metabolite β-phenylacetic acid (b-PAA) by on average 77%, compared with resting control subjects [54], which mirrors increased β-PEA synthesis in view of its limited endogenous pool half-life of ~30 s [18,55].}}</ref><ref name="PEA exercise primary">{{cite journal | vauthors = Szabo A, Billett E, Turner J | title = Phenylethylamine, a possible link to the antidepressant effects of exercise? | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 342–343 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11579070 | pmc = 1724404 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.35.5.342| quote = The 24 hour mean urinary concentration of phenylacetic acid was increased by 77% after exercise.&nbsp;... These results show substantial increases in urinary phenylacetic acid levels 24 hours after moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise. As phenylacetic acid reflects phenylethylamine levels<sup>3</sup>, and the latter has antidepressant effects, the antidepressant effects of exercise appear to be linked to increased phenylethylamine concentrations. Furthermore, considering the structural and pharmacological analogy between amphetamines and phenylethylamine, it is conceivable that phenylethylamine plays a role in the commonly reported "runners high" thought to be linked to cerebral β-endorphin activity. The substantial increase in phenylacetic acid excretion in this study implies that phenylethylamine levels are affected by exercise.&nbsp;... A 30 minute bout of moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise increases phenylacetic acid levels in healthy regularly exercising men. The findings may be linked to the antidepressant effects of exercise.}}</ref><ref name="Neuropsychiatric">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berry MD | title = The potential of trace amines and their receptors for treating neurological and psychiatric diseases | journal = Rev Recent Clin Trials | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–19 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18473983 | doi = 10.2174/157488707779318107| quote = It has also been suggested that the antidepressant effects of exercise are due to an exercise-induced elevation of PE [151].}}</ref> Two reviews noted a study where the mean 24&nbsp;hour urinary phenylacetic acid concentration following just 30&nbsp;minutes of intense exercise rose 77% above its base level;<ref name="Renaissance" /><ref name="PEA exercise primary" /><ref name="Neuropsychiatric" /> the reviews suggest that phenethylamine synthesis sharply increases during physical exercise during which it is rapidly metabolized due to its short half-life of roughly 30&nbsp;seconds.<ref name="Renaissance" /><ref name="PEA exercise primary" /><ref name="Neuropsychiatric" /><ref name="Vascular" /> In a resting state, phenethylamine is synthesized in [[catecholamine]] neurons from {{smallcaps all|L}}-[[phenylalanine]] by [[aromatic amino acid decarboxylase]] at approximately the same rate as dopamine is produced.<ref name="Vascular">{{cite journal | author = Broadley KJ | title = The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines | journal = Pharmacol.
