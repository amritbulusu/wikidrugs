Risedronate is taken orally, usually weekly or monthly.  Notably, if risedronate lodges in the [[esophagus]], it can lead to esophageal [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]]. Therefore, it is recommended that risedronate be taken with the body upright, and followed by a glass of water.  Moreover, risedronate is poorly absorbed when taken with food, so it is recommended that no food or drink other than water be taken for 2 hours before and 30 minutes after taking risedronate. Risedronate has a faster esophageal transit time and different chemical chain which results in less gastrointestinal side-effects than other drugs in this class. The dosage instructions also show that risedronate can be taken with less water than other drugs in the class.
