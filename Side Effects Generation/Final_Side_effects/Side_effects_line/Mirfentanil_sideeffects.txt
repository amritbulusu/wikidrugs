'''Mirfentanil''' is a [[fentanyl]] derivative with strong selectivity for the [[mu opioid receptor|μ opioid receptor]]. At lower doses, it antagonizes the [[analgesic]] effects of [[alfentanil]] and substitutes for [[naloxone]] in [[morphine]]-treated monkeys; however, it also reverses naloxone-precipitated [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] in pigeons trained to discriminate morphine from naloxone.<ref name="France 1991">{{cite journal | last1 = France | first1 = CP | last2 = Winger | first2 = G | last3 = Medzihradsky | first3 = F | last4 = Seggel | first4 = MR | last5 = Rice | first5 = KC | last6 = Woods | first6 = JH | date = Aug 1991 | title = Mirfentanil: pharmacological profile of a novel fentanyl derivative with opioid and nonopioid effects | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 258 | issue = 2| pages = 502–10 | pmid = 1650830 }}</ref>

 
Side effects of [[fentanyl]] analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]], which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959%2815%2900097-3/abstract | title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?
