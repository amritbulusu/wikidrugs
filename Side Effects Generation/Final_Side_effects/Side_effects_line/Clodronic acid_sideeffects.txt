'''Clodronic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''clodronate disodium''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is a first generation (non-nitrogenous) [[bisphosphonate]]. It is an anti-osteoporotic drug approved for the prevention and treatment of [[osteoporosis]] in post-menopausal women and men to reduce vertebral fractures, [[hyperparathyroidism]], [[hypercalcemia]] in malignancy, [[multiple myeloma]] and fracture related pain because of its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects shown as a reduction in inflammatory markers like [[Interleukin 1 beta|IL-1β]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-α]].<ref>{{cite journal | first1=Niina | last1=Pennanen | title=Effect of Liposomal and Free Bisphosphonates on the IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα Secretion from RAW 264 Cells in Vitro | last2=Lapinjoki | first2=Seppo | last3=Urtti | first3=Arto | last4=Mönkkönen | first4=Jukka | journal=Pharmaceutical Research | year=1995 | volume=12 | issue=6 | pages=916–922 | issn=0724-8741 | doi=10.1023/A:1016281608773}}</ref> While bisphosphonates are shown to be effective in reducing vertebral fractures and pain, their role in improving overall survival remains unclear.<ref>{{cite journal | first1=Rahul | last1=Mhaskar | title=Bisphosphonates in multiple myeloma: a network meta-analysis | last2=Redzepovic | first2=Jasmina | last3=Wheatley | first3=Keith | last4=Clark | first4=Otavio Augusto Camara | last5=Miladinovic | first5=Branko | last6=Glasmacher | first6=Axel | last7=Kumar | first7=Ambuj | last8=Djulbegovic | first8=Benjamin | last9=Kumar | first9=Ambuj | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | year=2012 | volume=5 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003188.pub3 | pmid=22592688 | pages=CD003188}}</ref>

 
Clodronic acid is approved for human use in Canada and Australia, the United Kingdom, where it is marketed as Bonefos, Loron, Clodron and in Italy as Clasteon, Difosfonal, Osteostab and several generics. In other countries is prescribed as a bone resorption inhibitor and antihypercalcemic agent.  It is not approved for use in the United States, because it has too many adverse effects.

 
Clodronic acid is approved for use in horses under the trade name Osphos, for treatment of bone resorptive processes of [[navicular syndrome]]. It is given by intramuscular injection at one point in time, with the total dose divided into 2-3 sites on the horse. Clinical effects (e.g. improvement of lameness) after a single treatment can be seen up to 6 months post-treatment.

 
Clodronic acid has been shown to have several adverse effects.
