On December 2, 2005, the FDA approved a synthetic (recombinant or rDNA) "human" hyaluronidase, Hylenex ([[Halozyme Therapeutics]]).<ref name="urlHalozyme Therapeutics and Baxter Healthcare Corporation Announce FDA Approval of Hylenex">{{cite web|url=http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/news_room/news_releases/2005/12-05-05-hylenex.html |title=Halozyme Therapeutics and Baxter Healthcare Corporation Announce FDA Approval of Hylenex |work= |accessdate=2008-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018065242/http://baxter.com/about_baxter/news_room/news_releases/2005/12-05-05-hylenex.html |archivedate=October 18, 2007 }}</ref> The FDA also approved [[HyQvia]] in late 2014,<ref name=fdahyq1>{{cite web|title=September 12, 2004 Approval Letter|url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProducts/LicensedProductsBLAs/FractionatedPlasmaProducts/ucm414148.htm|website=FDA|publisher=FDA.gov|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> a form of [[sub-cutaneous immunoglobulin]] (SCIG) that uses Hylenex to allow for a far greater volume of SCIG to be administered than would normally be possible to administer sub-cutaneously, providing a form of SCIG that can be dosed on a monthly basis, a longer period of time than other forms of SCIG allow.

Other studies suggest no contribution or effects independent of enzyme activity. Non-specific inhibitors (apigenin, sulfated glycosaminoglycans) or crude enzyme extracts have been used to test most hypotheses, making data difficult to interpret. It has been hypothesized that, by helping degrade the ECM surrounding the tumor, hyaluronidases help cancer cells escape from primary tumor masses. However, studies show that removal of hyaluronan from tumors prevents tumor invasion.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Hyaluronidases are also thought to play a role in the process of [[angiogenesis]], although most hyaluronidase preparations are contaminated with large amounts of angiogenic growth factors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahmanian|first1=Mehdi|last2=Heldin|first2=Paraskevi|title=Testicular hyaluronidase induces tubular structures of endothelial cells grown in three-dimensional colagen gel through a CD44-mediated mechanism|journal=International Journal of Cancer|date=10 February 2002|volume=97|issue=5|pages=601–607|doi=10.1002/ijc.10087}}</ref>
