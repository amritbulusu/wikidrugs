'''Epiestriol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (brand names '''Actriol''', '''Arcagynil''', '''Klimadoral'''), or '''epioestriol''' ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]), also known as '''16β-epiestriol''' or simply '''16-epiestriol''' as well as '''16β-hydroxy-17β-estradiol''', is a minor and weak [[endogenous]] [[estrogen]], and the 16β-[[epimer]] of [[estriol]] (which is 16α-hydroxy-17β-estradiol).<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.
