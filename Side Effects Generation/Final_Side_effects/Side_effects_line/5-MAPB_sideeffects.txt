'''5-MAPB''' ('''1-(benzofuran-5-yl)-''N''-methylpropan-2-amine''') is an [[entactogen]]ic [[designer drug]] similar to [[MDMA]] on its structure and effects.<ref name='ACMD report'>{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title = Temporary class drug order report on 5-6APB and NBOMe compounds | accessdate = 2013-07-10 | date = 4 Jun 2013 | publisher = UK Home Office}}</ref>

 
Little formal knowledge exists on 5-MAPB. It does not share the [[neurotoxin|neurotoxicity]] of [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]] caused by the [[2,5-bis-(glutathion-S-yl)-alpha-methyldopamine|alpha-methyldopamine]] metabolite.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McCann UD | author2 = Ricaurte GA | title = Major metabolites of (±)3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) do not mediate its toxic effects on brain serotonin neurons | journal = Brain Research | volume = 545 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 279–282 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1860050 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(91)91297-E }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Miller RT | author2 =  Lau SS | author3 = Monks TJ | title = 2,5-Bis-(glutathion-S-yl)-alpha-methyldopamine, a putative metabolite of (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, decreases brain serotonin concentrations | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 323 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 173–80 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9128836 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(97)00044-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Conway EL | author2 = Louis WJ | author3 = Jarrott B | title = Acute and chronic administration of alpha-methyldopa: regional levels of endogenous and alpha-methylated catecholamines in rat brain | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 52 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 271–80 | year = 1978 | pmid = 729639 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(78)90279-0 }}</ref> A study in rats indicated that the major metabolites of 5-MAPB are [[5-APB]] and 3-carboxymethyl-4-hydroxymethamphetamine.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00216-014-8360-0| pmid=25471293| title=Benzofuran analogues of amphetamine and methamphetamine: Studies on the metabolism and toxicological analysis of 5-APB and 5-MAPB in urine and plasma using GC-MS and LC-(HR)-MSn techniques| journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry| volume=407| issue=5| pages=1371–88| year=2014| last1=Welter| first1=Jessica| last2=Kavanagh| first2=Pierce| last3=Meyer| first3=Markus R.| last4=Maurer| first4=Hans H.}}</ref>

 
5-MAPB binds to the dopamine transporter in rat brain cells with a lower potency than cocaine. ''[[In silico]]'' data suggests that the primary action on dopamine is through reversal of the transporter to release dopamine. This is consistent with the effects and it is likely that it exerts a similar action on serotonin and norepinephrine transporters.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sahai |first=Michelle A |last2=Davidson |first2=Colin |last3=Khelashvili |first3=George  |year=2016 |title=Combined in vitro and in silico approaches to the assessment of stimulant properties of novel psychoactive substances – The case of the benzofuran 5-MAPB |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584616303979 |journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry |volume=75 |pages=1-9 |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2016.11.004}}</ref>
