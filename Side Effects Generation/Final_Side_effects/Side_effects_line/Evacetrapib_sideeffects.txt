'''Evacetrapib''' was a [[medication|drug]] under development by [[Eli Lilly & Company]] (investigational name '''LY2484595''') that inhibits [[cholesterylester transfer protein]] ([[CETP inhibitor]]). CETP collects [[triglyceride]]s from [[very low-density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL) or [[low-density lipoprotein]]s (LDL) and exchanges them for [[cholesteryl ester]]s from [[high-density lipoprotein]]s (HDL), and vice versa, but primarily increasing high-density lipoprotein and lowering low-density lipoprotein. It is thought that modifying lipoprotein levels modifies the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name="pmid21957197"/> The first CETP inhibitor, [[torcetrapib]], was unsuccessful because it increased levels of the hormone [[aldosterone]] and increased [[blood pressure]],<ref name="pmid19522058"/> which led to excess cardiac events when it was studied.<ref name="pmid19522058"/> Evacetrapib does not have the same effect.<ref name="pmid21957197">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cao G, Beyer TP, Zhang Y |title=Evacetrapib is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein that elevates HDL cholesterol without inducing aldosterone or increasing blood pressure |journal=J.

Evacetrapib evaluation for treatment of high-risk vascular disease was discontinued due to lack of efficacy, as had already happened in the past with two other CETP inhibitors ([[torcetrapib]] and [[dalcetrapib]]<ref name="pmid23126252">{{cite journal |author=Schwartz GG |title=Effects of dalcetrapib in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=367 |issue=22 |pages=2089–99 |date=Nov 2015 |pmid=23126252|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1206797}}</ref>) due to increased deaths and little identifiable cardiovascular benefit (despite substantial increases in HDL). Some hypothesize that CETP inhibitors may still be useful in the treatment of dyslipidemia, though significant caution is warranted.<ref name="pmid19522058">{{cite journal |vauthors=Joy T, Hegele RA |title=The end of the road for CETP inhibitors after torcetrapib? |journal=Curr.
