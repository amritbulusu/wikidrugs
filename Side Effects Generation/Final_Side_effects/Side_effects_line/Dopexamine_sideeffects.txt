Dopexamine may potentiate the effects of other catecholamines like [[noradrenaline]].    Effects of depexamine may be suppressed by concomitant use with  ÃŸ2-adrenergic and dopamine receptor antagonists requires caution.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

 
As of 2004 there was some controversy surrounding the mechanism of dopexamine.  Some held that its local effects of increased tissue perfusion were due only to increased output from the heart, while others held that were direct peripheral effects.<ref name=ESA2004>{{cite web|last1=Meier-Hellmann|first1=Andreas|last2=Vlasakov|first2=Kamen|title=Management of Sepsis|publisher=European Society of Anaesthesiologists|date=June 5, 2004}}</ref>
