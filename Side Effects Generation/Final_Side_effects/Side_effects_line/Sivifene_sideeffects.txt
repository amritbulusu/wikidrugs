Initially, due to its structural similarity to [[tamoxifen]], sivifene was thought to be a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM), but subsequent research revealed that it does not bind to the [[estrogen receptor]] (ER) and does not possess [[antiestrogen]]ic activity.<ref name="pmid16184382" /> The actual [[mechanism of action]] of sivifene is unknown, but it is thought to produce its immunomodulating effects via [[upregulation]] of the [[CD45]] [[T-lymphocyte]] [[cell surface receptor]].<ref name="pmid16184382" />
