Johann Rudolf Geigy-Merian (1830–1917) and Johann Muller-Pack acquired a site in Basel in 1857, where they built a [[dyewood]] mill and a [[dye]] extraction plant. Two years later, they began the production of synthetic [[fuchsine]]. In 1901, they formed the [[public limited company]] Geigy and the name of the company was changed to J. R. Geigy Ltd in 1914. In 1925, J. R. Geigy Ltd. began producing textile auxiliaries,<ref>"Textile auxiliaries" are in the class of [[specialty chemicals]] and "enable a processing operation in preparation, dyeing, printing, or finishing to be carried out more effectively or which is essential if a given effect is to be obtained.

The [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] effects of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) were discovered at the Sandoz laboratories in 1943 by [[Arthur Stoll]] and [[Albert Hofmann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/albert-hofmann-102-invented-lsd/75591/ |title=Albert Hofmann, 102, Invented LSD - The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020203430/http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/albert-hofmann-102-invented-lsd/75591/ | archivedate = 2013-10-20| deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2438259|title=Patent US2438259 - D-lysergic acid diethyl amide|work=google.com}}</ref> Sandoz began clinical trials and marketed the substance, from 1947 through the mid-1960s, under the name ''Delysid'' as a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] drug, thought useful for treating a wide variety of [[Mental disorder|mental ailments]], ranging from [[alcoholism]] to [[sexual deviancy]].

The drug became a cultural novelty of the 1960s after psychologist [[Timothy Leary]] at [[Harvard University]] began to promote its use for recreational and spiritual experiences among the general public.
