Tubocurarine is a naturally occurring mono-quaternary [[alkaloid]] obtained from the bark of the South American plant ''[[Chondrodendron tomentosum]]'', a climbing vine known to the European world since the Spanish conquest of South America. [[Curare]] had been used as a source of [[arrow poison]] by South American natives to hunt animals, and they were able to eat the animals' contaminated flesh subsequently without any adverse effects because tubocurarine cannot easily cross [[mucous membranes]].Thus, tubocurarine is effective only if given [[parenteral]]ly, as demonstrated by [[Claude Bernard|Bernard]], who also showed that the site of its action was at the neuromuscular junction.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Bernard C |title= Analyse physiologie des propriétés des actions de curare et de la nicotine sure systèmes musculaire et nerveux au moyen du curare | journal= Compt.

Unna et al. reported the effects of tubocurarine on humans:

 
Tubocurarine has a time of onset of around 5 minutes which is relatively slow among [[neuromuscular-blocking drug]]s, and has a duration of action of 60 to 120 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Thompson MA |title= Muscle relaxant drugs| journal= Br J Hosp Med | volume= 23 |issue= 2|pages=153–4, 163–4, 167–8 passim |year=1980 |month= |pmid= 6102875|doi= }}</ref><ref name=Rang151>Page 151 in: {{cite book |author=Rang, H.

The [[potassium channel blocker]] [[tetraethylammonium]] (TEA) has been shown to reverse the effects of tubocurarine. It is thought to do so by increasing ACh release, which counteracts the antagonistic effects of tubocurarine on the ACh receptor.
