'''Moxonidine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a new-generation centrally acting [[antihypertensive]] drug licensed for the treatment of mild to moderate [[essential hypertension]]. It may have a role when [[thiazides]], [[beta-blocker]]s, [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[calcium channel blocker]]s are not appropriate or have failed to control blood pressure. In addition, it demonstrates favourable effects on parameters of the [[insulin resistance]] syndrome, apparently independent of blood pressure reduction. It is manufactured by [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]] Pharmaceuticals under the brand name '''Physiotens'''.

 
'''Effects on insulin resistance'''

 
In all animal models of insulin resistance, moxonidine had striking effects on the development of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and impaired glucose homeostasis. Given the importance of insulin resistance as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is of considerable relevance that  it has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.

 
Routine toxicology studies have provided no evidence that moxonidine has any teratogenic, mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. No evidence has been found of serious adverse effects on organs or organ systems, and the drug has not been shown to have deleterious effects on perinatal or postnatal growth and development.

 
Moxonidine should be avoided in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug should also be avoided. If concomitant treatment with a beta blocker has to be stopped, the beta blocker should be discontinued first, then moxonidine after a few days. Alcohol may potentiate the hypotensive effects of Moxonidine.

 
Concomitant administration of moxonidine and a thiazide diuretic such as [[hydrochlorothiazide]] is not indicated, as both drugs' hypotensive effects may be enhanced.
