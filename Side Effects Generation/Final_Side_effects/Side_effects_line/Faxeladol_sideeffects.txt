'''Faxeladol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) (code names '''GRTA-9906''', '''GRTA-0009906''', '''EM-906''', '''GCR-9905''', '''GRT-TA300''') is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] which was developed by [[Gr√ºnenthal GmbH]] but was never marketed for medical use anywhere in the world. It is related to [[tramadol]] and [[ciramadol]], and was developed shortly after tramadol in the late 1970s. Similarly to tramadol, it was believed faxeladol would have [[analgesic]], as well as [[antidepressant]] effects, due to its action on [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] [[reuptake]]. In various studies in the 1970s alongside tramadol, faxeladol was seen to be slightly more potent than tramadol, but with a higher rate of sudden [[seizure]]s than tramadol, which is known to cause seizures without warning in some users.
