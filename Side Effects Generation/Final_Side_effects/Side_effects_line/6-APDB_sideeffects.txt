In animal studies, 6-APDB fully substitutes for [[N-methyl-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)butan-2-amine|MBDB]] and [[5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-aminoindane|MMAI]] but not for [[amphetamine]] or [[LSD]].<ref name="pmid8246240"/> ''[[In vitro]]'', 6-APDB has been shown to [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]] with [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 322 nM, 1,997 nM, and 980 nM, respectively.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> These values are very similar to those of MDA, but with those for the [[catecholamine]]s slightly lower in comparison, perhaps more similarly to MDMA.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> In contrast, 5-APDB is highly selective for serotonin.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> Though 6-APDB does not substitute for amphetamine in rats at the doses used in referenced study, based on its ''in vitro'' profile it can be suggested that it may have amphetamine-like effects at higher doses.

 
The unsaturated benzofuran derivative [[6-APB]], or 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran is also known, but the difference in pharmacological effects between 6-APB and 6-APDB is unclear.
