'''Eterobarb''' ('''Antilon''') is a [[barbiturate]] derivative. It has mainly [[anticonvulsant]] action with less [[sedative]] effects than the closely related compound [[phenobarbital]]. It saw reasonable success in clinical trials, but is not in widespread medical use.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = BB | last2 = Baumel | first2 = IP | last3 = Woodbury | first3 = SG | last4 = Dimicco | first4 = JA | title = Clinical evaluation of eterobarb, a new anticonvulsant drug | journal = Neurology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 399–404 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1094318 | doi=10.1212/wnl.25.5.399}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = DB | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = SG | last3 = Roomet | first3 = A | title = A comparison of the toxicity effects of the anticonvulsant eterobarb (antilon, DMMP) and phenobarbital in normal human volunteers | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–55 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3956454 | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1986.tb03518.x}}</ref>
