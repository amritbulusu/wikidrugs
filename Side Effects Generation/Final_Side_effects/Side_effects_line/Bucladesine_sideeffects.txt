Recently, the effect of bucladesine as a cAMP analog has been studied on the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure in the wild-type mice. The data showed that bucladesine (300nM/mouse) reduced the seizure latency and threshold. In addition they found that combination of bucladesine and pentoxyfillin has additive effect on seizure latency and threshold.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hosseini-Zare MS, Salehi F, Seyedi SY, Azami K, Ghadiri T, Mobasseri M, Gholizadeh S, Beyer C, Sharifzadeh M |title=Effects of pentoxifylline and H-89 on epileptogenic activity of bucladesine in pentylenetetrazol-treated mice |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=670 |issue=2–3 |pages=464–70 |year=2011 |pmid=21946102 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.09.026 }}</ref>
