'''BMS-564,929''' is an investigational [[selective androgen receptor modulator]], which is being developed by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] for treatment of the symptoms of age-related decline in androgen levels in men ("[[andropause]]"). These symptoms may include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], loss of [[muscle]] mass and [[Physical strength|strength]], reduction in [[libido]] and [[osteoporosis]]. Treatment with exogenous [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] is effective in counteracting these symptoms but is associated with a range of side effects, the most serious of which is enlargement of the [[prostate gland]], which can lead to [[benign prostatic hypertrophy]] and even [[prostate cancer]]. This means there is a clinical need for selective androgen receptor modulators, which produce [[anabolic]] effects in some tissues such as muscle and bone, but without stimulating androgen receptors in the prostate.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = W | last2 = Dalton | first2 = JT | title = Expanding the therapeutic use of androgens via selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 12 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 241–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17331889 | pmc = 2072879 | doi = 10.1016/j.drudis.2007.01.003 }}</ref> 

 
Selective androgen receptor modulators may also be used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to [[anabolic steroid]]s but with significantly fewer side effects. For this reason, SARMs have already been banned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] since January 2008 despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs are currently being developed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thevis | first1 = M | last2 = Kohler | first2 = M | last3 = Schlörer | first3 = N | last4 = Kamber | first4 = M | last5 = Kühn | first5 = A | last6 = Linscheid | first6 = MW | last7 = Schänzer | first7 = W | title = Mass spectrometry of hydantoin-derived selective androgen receptor modulators | journal = Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 639–50 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18095383 | doi = 10.1002/jms.1364 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thevis | first1 = M | last2 = Kohler | first2 = M | last3 = Thomas | first3 = A | last4 = Maurer | first4 = J | last5 = Schlörer | first5 = N | last6 = Kamber | first6 = M | last7 = Schänzer | first7 = W | title = Determination of benzimidazole- and bicyclic hydantoin-derived selective androgen receptor antagonists and agonists in human urine using LC-MS/MS | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 391 | issue = 1 | pages = 251–61 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18270691 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-008-1882-6 }}</ref>
