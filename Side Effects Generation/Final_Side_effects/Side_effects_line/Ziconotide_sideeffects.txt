Ziconotide is derived from the toxin of the [[cone snail]] species ''[[Conus magus]]''. Scientists have been intrigued by the effects of the thousands of chemicals in marine snail toxins since the initial investigations in the late 1960s by [[Baldomero Olivera]]. Olivera, now a professor of biology in the [[University of Utah]], was inspired by accounts of the deadly effects of these toxins from his childhood in the Philippines. Ziconotide was discovered in the early 1980s by University of Utah research scientist Michael McIntosh,<ref name="pmid7149738">{{cite journal |vauthors=McIntosh M, Cruz LJ, Hunkapiller MW, Gray WR, Olivera BM | title = Isolation and structure of a peptide toxin from the marine snail Conus magus | journal = Arch.

Due to the profound side effects or lack of efficacy when delivered through more common routes, such as orally or intravenously, ziconotide must be administered [[intrathecal]]ly (i.e. directly into the spinal fluid). As this is  the most expensive and invasive method of drug delivery and involves additional risks of its own,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/510621_7 |title=Medscape |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format= |work=}}</ref> ziconotide therapy is generally considered appropriate (as evidenced by the range of use approved by the FDA in US) only for “management of severe chronic pain in patients for whom intrathecal (IT) therapy is warranted and who are intolerant of or refractory to other treatment, such as systemic [[analgesics]], adjunctive therapies or IT [[morphine]]”.<ref name="titleU.S. Pharmacist">{{cite web |url=http://www.uspharmacist.com/index.asp?page=ce/10186/default.htm |title=U.S. Pharmacist |accessdate=2007-12-21 |work=}}</ref> Research is ongoing to determine whether ziconotide can be formulated in a way that would allow it to be administered by less invasive means.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Anand|first=Prachi|date=3 August 2015|title=Tailored delivery of analgesic ziconotide across a blood brain barrier model using viral nanocontainers|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150730/srep12497/full/srep12497.html|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|doi=10.1038/srep12497|access-date=27 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Palca|first=Joe|date=3 August 2015|title=Snail Venom Yields Potent Painkiller, But Delivering The Drug Is Tricky|url=http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/08/03/428990755/snail-venom-yields-potent-painkiller-but-delivering-the-drug-is-tricky|newspaper=[[NPR]]|location= |access-date=5 August 2015}}</ref>

Ziconotide is also contraindicated for patients with certain preexisting [[mental disorders]] (e.g. [[psychosis]]) due to evidence that they are more susceptible to certain severe side effects.<ref>[https://www.prialt.com/downloads/product_information.pdf prialt.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315192710/https://www.prialt.com/downloads/product_information.pdf |date=March 15, 2006 }}</ref>

 
The most common side effects are dizziness, [[nausea]], confusion, nystagmus and headache. Others may include weakness, [[hypertonia]], [[ataxia]], abnormal vision, [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[somnolence]], unsteadiness on feet, [[vertigo]], urinary retention, pruritis, increased sweating, [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], vomiting, [[asthenia]], [[fever]], rigors, [[sinusitis]], muscle spasms, myalgia, [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], amnesia, [[nystagmus]], [[tremor]], memory impairment and induced psychiatric disorders. Other side effects which are less frequent but still clinically significant include auditory and visual [[hallucinations]], thoughts of suicide, acute kidney failure, [[atrial fibrillation]], cardiovascular accident, [[sepsis]], new or worsening depression, paranoia, disorientation, [[meningitis]] and [[seizures]]. Therefore, it is contraindicated in people with a history of [[psychosis]], [[schizophrenia]], clinical depression, and [[bipolar disorder]]. Recent incidents suggesting a link between intrathecal ziconotide treatment and increased risk of suicide have led to calls for strict and ongoing psychiatric monitoring of patients to avoid suicide occurring in vulnerable individuals.<ref name="pmid21041028">{{cite journal |vauthors=Maier C, Gockel HH, Gruhn K, Krumova EK, Edel MA |title=Increased risk of suicide under intrathecal ziconotide treatment? – A warning |journal=Pain |volume= 152|issue= 1|pages= 235–237|date=October 2010 |pmid=21041028 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2010.10.007 |url=}}</ref> There is no known antidote.
