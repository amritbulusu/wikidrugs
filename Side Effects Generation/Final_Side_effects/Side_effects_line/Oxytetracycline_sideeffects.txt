== Side effects ==

 
Side effects are mainly gastrointestinal and photosensitive allergic reactions common to the [[tetracycline antibiotics]] group. It can also damage calcium-rich organs, such as teeth and bones, although this is very rare.  It sometimes causes nasal cavities to erode; quite commonly, the BNF suggests, because of this, tetracyclines should not be used to treat pregnant or lactating women and children under 12 except in certain conditions where it has been approved by a specialist because there are no obvious substitutes. [[Candidiasis]] (thrush) is not uncommon following treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

 
Oxytetracycline can also be used to correct breathing disorders in livestock. It is administered in a powder or through an intramuscular injection.  American livestock producers apply oxytetracycline to livestock feed to prevent diseases and infections in cattle and poultry.  The antibiotic is partially absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal and the remaining is deposited in manure.  Researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] studied the breakdown of oxytetracycline in manure depending on various environmental conditions. They found the breakdown slowed with increased saturation of the manure and concluded this was a result of decreased oxygen levels.
