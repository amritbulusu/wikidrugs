Intravenous etilefrine increases the pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, [[central venous pressure]] and [[mean arterial pressure]] of healthy individuals. [[Peripheral vascular resistance]] falls during the infusion of 1–8&nbsp;mg etilefrine but begins to rise at higher dosage. Marked falls in pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and peripheral bloodflow, accompanied by rises in mean arterial pressure, occur when etilefrine is infused after administration of intravenous [[propranolol]] 2,5&nbsp;mg. These findings indicate that etilefrine has both β<sub>1</sub> and [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic]] effects in man.
