'''Silibinin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''silybin '''(both from ''[[Silybum]]'', the [[Genus–differentia definition|generic]] name of the [[plant]] from which it is extracted), is the major active constituent of '''silymarin''', a standardized extract of the [[Silybum marianum|milk thistle]] seeds, containing a mixture of [[flavonolignan]]s consisting of silibinin, [[isosilibinin]], [[silicristin]], [[silidianin]], and others.  Silibinin itself is a mixture of two [[diastereomer]]s, silybin A and silybin B, in approximately equimolar ratio.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis-Searles P, Nakanishi Y, Nam-Cheol K ''et al'' | year = 2005 | title = Milk Thistle and Prostate Cancer: Differential Effects of Pure Flavonolignans from Silybum marianum on Antiproliferative End Points in Human Prostate Carcinoma Cells | url = | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 65 | issue = 10| pages = 4448–57 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4662 | pmid=15899838}}</ref>  The mixture exhibits a number of pharmacological effects, particularly in the liver, and there is some clinical evidence for the use of silibinin as a supportive element in alcoholic and child grade 'A' [[liver cirrhosis]].<ref name=Saller2008/>

 
A [[phase I clinical trial]] in humans with prostate cancer designed to study the effects of high dose silibinin found 13 grams daily to be well tolerated in patients with advanced prostate cancer with asymptomatic liver toxicity ([[hyperbilirubinemia]] and elevation of [[alanine aminotransferase]]) being the most commonly seen adverse event.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Investigational New Drugs | year = 2007 | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–146 | title = A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of silybin-phytosome in prostate cancer patients |author1=Thomas W.

Silibinin also has a number of potential mechanisms that could benefit the skin. These include chemoprotective effects from environmental toxins, anti-inflammatory effects, protection from UV induced photocarcinogenesis, protection from sunburn, protection from [[Ultraviolet|UVB]]-induced [[epidermal hyperplasia]], and [[DNA repair]] for UV induced DNA damage (double strand breaks).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Rana P.|last2=Agarwal|first2=Rajesh|title=Cosmeceuticals and silibinin|journal=Clinics in Dermatology|date=September 2009|volume=27|issue=5|pages=479–484|doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2009.05.012|pmid=19695480|pmc=2767273}}</ref>
