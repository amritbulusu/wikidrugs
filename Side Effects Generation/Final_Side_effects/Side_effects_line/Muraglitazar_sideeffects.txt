Data on muraglitazar is relatively sparse due to the recent introduction of this agent. One double-blind randomized clinical trial<ref name="Kendall" /> comparing muraglitazar and [[pioglitazone]] found that the effects of the former were favourable in terms of [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL-C]] increase, decrease in total [[cholesterol]], [[apolipoprotein B]], [[triglyceride]]s and a greater reduction in [[Glycated hemoglobin|HbA<sub>1c</sub>]] ([[p-value|''p'']] <0.0001 for all comparisons). However, the muraglitazar group had a higher all-cause mortality, greater incidence of [[edema]] and [[heart failure]] and more weight gain compared to the pioglitazone group. A [[meta-analysis]] of the phase II and III clinical trials of muraglitazar revealed that it was associated with a greater incidence of [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]], [[transient ischemic attack]]s and congestive heart failure (CHF) when compared to placebo or pioglitazone.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nissen|first1=SE|last2=Wolski|first2=K|last3=Topol|first3=EJ|title=Effect of Muraglitazar on Death and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=23 November 2005|volume=294|issue=20|pages=2581â€“6|doi=10.1001/jama.294.20.joc50147|pmid=16239637|accessdate=9 November 2016}}</ref>
