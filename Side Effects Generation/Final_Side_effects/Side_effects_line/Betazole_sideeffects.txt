Betazole is used as a stimulant in preference to histamine because of its specificity for the [[histamine H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub> receptor]] and its advantage of not generating the undesirable side effects that histamine would induce. It therefore does not require concomitant use of antihistaminic compounds to block the actions of histamine at other histamine receptor types.

 
Its action in stimulating histamine release can be of use when testing the effectiveness of H<sub>2</sub> receptor blocking drugs such as [[nizatidine]].<ref>{{cite journal | author =Hammond JB, Offen WW| title =Effect of nizatidine and cimetidine on betazole-stimulated gastric secretion of normal subjects: comparison of effects on acid, water, and pepsin. |journal =Am J Gastroenterol.|year =1988 |volume =83 |pages = 32â€“6 | pmid =2892392 | issue =1}}</ref>
