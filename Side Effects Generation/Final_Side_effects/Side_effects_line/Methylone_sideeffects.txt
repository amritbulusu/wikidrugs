Methylone substitutes for MDMA in rats trained to discriminate MDMA from [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]. Methylone does not substitute for amphetamine or for the hallucinogenic DOM in animals trained to discriminate between these drugs and saline.<ref>TA Dal Cason, R Young, RA Glennon. Cathinone: an investigation of several N-alkyl and methylenedioxy-substituted analogs. ''Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 58'', 1109–1116 (1997)</ref> Further, also in common with MDMA, methylone acts on monoaminergic systems. ''[[In vitro]]'', methylone has one third the potency of MDMA at inhibiting platelet serotonin accumulation and about the same in its inhibiting effects on the dopamine and noradrenaline transporters.<ref>NV Cozzi, MK Sievert, AT Shulgin, P Jacob III, AE Ruoho.

In spite of these behavioral and pharmacological similarities between methylone and MDMA, the observed subjective effects of both drugs are not completely identical.

Methylone acts as a mixed [[reuptake inhibitor]]/[[releasing agent]] of [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]].<ref name="pmid10528135"/><ref name="pmid17223101">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagai F, Nonaka R, Satoh Hisashi Kamimura K | title = The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 559 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 132–7 |date=March 2007 | pmid = 17223101 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014-2999(06)01381-1}}</ref> In comparison to MDMA, it has approximately 3x lower [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[serotonin transporter]], while its affinity for the [[norepinephrine transporter|norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine transporter]]s is similar.<ref name="pmid10528135"/><ref name="pmid17223101"/> Notably, methylone's affinity for the [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2) is about 13x lower than that of MDMA.<ref name="pmid10528135"/> The results of these differences in pharmacology relative to MDMA are that methylone is less [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] in terms of [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]], has more balanced [[catecholaminergic]] effects relative to [[serotonergic]], and behaves more like a reuptake inhibitor like [[methylphenidate]] than a releaser like [[amphetamine]]; however, methylone has relatively robust releasing capabilities,<ref name="pmid17223101"/> perhaps due to its ability to [[phosphorylate]] the [[monoamine transporter]]s being similar in potency relative to MDMA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
