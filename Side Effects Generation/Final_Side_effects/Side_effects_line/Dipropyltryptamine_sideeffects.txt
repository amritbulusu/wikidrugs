Frequent physical effects are [[nausea]], [[paresthesia|numbness]] of the [[tongue]] or [[throat]], and [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]].

 
Studies on rodents have found that the effectiveness with which a selective [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] blocks the behavioral actions of this compound strongly suggest that the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor is an important site of action for DPT, but the modulatory actions of a [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] antagonist also imply a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-mediated component to the actions of DPT.<ref>William E. Fantegrossi, Chad J. Reissig, Elyse B. Katz, Haley L. Yarosh, Kenner C. Rice, Jerrold C. Winterb.

While dipropyltryptamine is chemically similar to [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT), its psychoactive effects are markedly different.<ref>{{cite book

 
== Side Effects ==

 
Negative side effects of human consumption of this drug can include, increased heart rate, dizziness, and nausea. There is one death associated with the use of dipropyltryptamine, which appears to have been the result of a fatal seizure caused by the drug itself. The dosage taken by the victim was unknown however the drug has never been known to cause harm at usual doses so any fatality can be assumed to be a massive overdose. <ref>[http://www.startribune.com/carver-county-teen-s-death-puts-spotlight-on-ease-of-purchasing-synthetic-drugs-online/330344661/]</ref>
