'''Tabimorelin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (developmental code name '''NN-703''') is a [[drug]] which acts as a potent, [[Oral administration|orally-active]] [[agonist]] of the [[growth hormone secretagogue receptor|ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor]] (GHSR) and [[growth hormone secretagogue]], mimicking the effects of the [[endogenous]] [[peptide]] [[agonist]] [[ghrelin]] as a stimulator of [[growth hormone]] (GH) release. It was one of the first GH secretagogues developed and is largely a modified [[polypeptide]], but it is nevertheless orally-active ''in vivo''.<ref>Hansen BS, Raun K, Nielsen KK, Johansen PB, Hansen TK, Peschke B, Lau J, Andersen PH, Ankersen M.
