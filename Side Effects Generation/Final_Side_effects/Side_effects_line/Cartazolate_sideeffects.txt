'''Cartazolate''' ('''SQ-65,396''') is a [[drug]] of the [[pyrazolopyridine]] class. It acts as a [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] [[positive allosteric modulator]] at the [[barbiturate]] [[binding site]] of the complex and has [[anxiolytic]] effects in animals.<ref name="pmid6103810">{{cite journal |vauthors=Placheta P, Karobath M | title = In vitro modulation by SQ 20009 and SQ 65396 of GABA receptor binding in rat CNS membranes | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 62 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 225–8 |date=March 1980 | pmid = 6103810 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(80)90281-2| url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid6114867">{{cite journal |vauthors=Supavilai P, Karobath M | title = Action of pyrazolopyridines as modulators of &#91;3H&#93;flunitrazepam binding to the gaba/benzodiazepine receptor complex of the cerebellum | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–93 |date=March 1981 | pmid = 6114867 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(81)90213-2| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0014-2999(81)90213-2}}</ref><ref name="pmid7050308">{{cite journal |vauthors=Leeb-Lundberg F, Snowman A, Olsen RW | title = Perturbation of benzodiazepine receptor binding by pyrazolopyridines involves picrotoxinin/barbiturate receptor sites | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 471–7 |date=May 1981 | pmid = 7050308 | doi = | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7050308}}</ref><ref name="pmid2154549">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bristow DR, Martin IL | title = Biochemical characterization of an isolated and functionally reconstituted gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 751–61 |date=March 1990 | pmid = 2154549 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.1990.tb02315.x| url = }}</ref> It is also known to act as an [[adenosine]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] at the [[adenosine A1 receptor|A<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Adenosine A2 receptor (disambiguation)|A<sub>2</sub> subtypes]] and as a [[phosphodiesterase inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid2829919">{{cite journal |vauthors=Daly JW, Hong O, Padgett WL, Shamim MT, Jacobson KA, Ukena D | title = Non-xanthine heterocycles: activity as antagonists of A1- and A2-adenosine receptors | journal = [[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 655–64 |date=February 1988 | pmid = 2829919 | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90139-6| url = | pmc=3445624}}</ref><ref name="pmid6182575">{{cite journal | author = Wachtel H | title = Characteristic behavioural alterations in rats induced by rolipram and other selective adenosine cyclic 3', 5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitors | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 309–16 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6182575 | doi = 10.1007/BF00432761| url = }}</ref> Cartazolate was tested in human [[clinical trial]]s and was found to be efficacious for [[anxiety]] but was never marketed.<ref name="isbn0-8247-7548-1">{{cite book | author = O'Brien, Robert | title = Receptor binding in drug research | publisher = Dekker | location = New York | year = 1986 | page = 519 | isbn = 0-8247-7548-1 | oclc = | doi = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GDE2VTeeHPIC&lpg=PA78&dq=cartazolate&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> It was developed by a team at E.R.
