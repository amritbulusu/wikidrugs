Adrafinil is a [[prodrug]]; it is primarily [[metabolize]]d ''[[in vivo]]'' to [[modafinil]], resulting in very similar [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effects.<ref name="Milgram2014" /> Unlike modafinil, however, it takes time for the [[metabolite]] to accumulate to active levels in the bloodstream. Effects usually are apparent within 45–60 minutes when taken orally on an empty [[stomach]].

 
Because [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]s were found to block effects of adrafinil and modafinil in animals, "most investigators assume[d] that adrafinil and modafinil both serve as α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonists."<ref name="Milgram2014" /> However, adrafinil and modafinil have not been found to bind to the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor and they lack [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[sympathomimetic]] [[side effect]]s associated with activation of this receptor;<ref name="pmid6310690">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon P, Chermat R, Puech AJ | title = Pharmacological evidence of the stimulation of central alpha-adrenergic receptors | journal = Prog.

In a [[clinical trial]] with [[clomipramine]] and [[placebo]] as active comparators, adrafinil showed efficacy in the treatment of [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="Milgram2014" /> In contrast to clomipramine however, adrafinil was well-tolerated, and showed greater improvement in [[psychomotor retardation]] in comparison.<ref name="Milgram2014" /> As such, "further investigations of the antidepressive effects of adrafinil are warranted."<ref name="Milgram2014" />
