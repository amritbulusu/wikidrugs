Flunixin is administered at a dose of 1.1&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="McIlwraith">McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 182-187.</ref> The full analgesic and antipyretic effects usually occur 1–2 hours following treatment, but there is often an effective analgesic effect within approximately 15 minutes. Despite its short [[biological half life|plasma half life]] of 1.6-2.5 hours, effects can persist for up to 30 hours,<ref>May SA, Lees P. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In McIlwraith CW, Trotter GW, eds. Joint disease in the horse. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1996;223–237.</ref> with maximal effects occurring between 2 and 16 hours. This is likely due to accumulation of the drug at inflammatory foci. Flunixin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.<ref>Soma, L R (11/01/1988).

Because it targets the inflamed tissue, flunixin is mainly used for [[colic]] pain, musculoskeletal pain, and ocular pain.<ref name="Foreman 2012">Foreman, J. H., Bergstrom, B. E., Golden, K.

==Side effects and precautions==

 
Flunixin is labeled for no more than 5 days of consecutive use and prolonged use increases the risk of toxicity. In horses, this includes [[equine gastric ulcer syndrome|gastric ulcers]],<ref>Videla, R. & Andrews, F.M. (2009) New perspectives in equine gastriculcer syndrome. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice, 25, 283–301.</ref> right dorsal colitis,<ref>McConnico, R.S., Morgan, T.W., Williams, C.C., Hubert, J.D. & Moore, R.M. (2008) Pathophysiologic effects of phenylbutazone on the rightdorsal colon in horses. American Journal of Veterinary Research, 69,1496–1505.</ref> and [[nephrotoxicity]].<ref>Black, H.E. (1986) Renal toxicity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Toxicologic Pathology, 14,83–90.</ref>

 
Administration of [[phenylbutazone]] to a horse also receiving flunixin has been shown to increase the risk of toxicity without improving analgesia.<ref>FOREMAN, J. H. and RUEMMLER, R. (2011), Phenylbutazone and flunixin meglumine used singly or in combination in experimental lameness in horses.

(2006) Effects of phenylbutazone alone or in combination with flunixin meglumine on blood protein concentrations in horses. Am. J. vet. Res. 67, 398-402.</ref> For this reason, concurrent administration with another NSAID is not recommended. Doubling the dose of flunixin produces no improvement in analgesia, while potentially increasing the risk of toxicity.<ref name="Foreman 2012" />
