'''Dexoxadrol''' ('''Dioxadrol''') is a [[Dissociative drug|dissociative]] [[anaesthetic]] drug which has been found to be an [[NMDA antagonist]] and produces similar effects to [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] in animals. Dexoxadrol, along with another related drug [[etoxadrol]], were developed as [[analgesic]]s for use in humans, but development was discontinued after patients reported side effects such as [[nightmares]] and [[hallucinations]].<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Sax, M. |author2=Wünsch, B. | title = Relationships between the structure of dexoxadrol and etoxadrol analogues and their NMDA receptor affinity | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | year = 2006 | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 723–732 | pmid = 16719812 | doi=10.2174/156802606776894483}}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Aepkers, M. |author2=Wünsch, B. | title = Structure-affinity relationship studies of non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists derived from dexoxadrol and etoxadrol | journal = Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry | year = 2005 | volume = 13 | issue = 24 | pages = 6836–6849 | doi = 10.1016/j.bmc.2005.07.030 | pmid = 16169732 }}</ref>
