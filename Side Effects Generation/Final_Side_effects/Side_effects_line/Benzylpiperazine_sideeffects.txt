'''Benzylpiperazine''' ('''BZP''') is a [[recreational drug]] with [[euphoriant]] and [[stimulant]] properties. The effects produced by BZP are comparable to those produced by [[amphetamine]]. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including [[psychosis|acute psychosis]], [[renal]] toxicity and [[seizures]].<ref name="Schep2011">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM, Gee P |title=The clinical toxicology of the designer "party pills" benzylpiperazine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine |journal=[[Clin Toxicol (Phila)]] |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=131–41 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21495881 |doi=10.3109/15563650.2011.572076 |url=}}</ref> No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, although there have been at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and [[MDMA]]. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania and other parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title =Legal dance drug faces ban amid fears over side-effects|author= Topping, Alexandra |work=The Guardian|date = 18 June 2007|url =https://www.theguardian.com/drugs/Story/0,,2105482,00.html|accessdate = 2008-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =Harney announces ban on stimulant BZP|author= Examiner|publisher = The Irish Examiner|date = 18 June 2007|url =http://www.examiner.ie/breaking/ireland/eyaueyidqlql/|accessdate = 2009-12-28}}</ref>

 
It is often claimed that BZP was originally synthesized as a potential [[antihelminthic]] (anti-parasitic) agent for use in farm animals.<ref>{{cite web|title = Lay off the party pills|publisher = New Zealand Medical Association| date = 1 November 2006|url =http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0611/S00001.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-22}}</ref> However, there are some references to BZP in medical literature that predate interest in [[piperazine]]s as antihelminthics. Even so, the majority of the early work with the piperazines were investigations into their potential use as antihelminthics with the earliest [[clinical trial]]s in the literature relating to piperazine being articles in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=White R, Standen O |title=Piperazine in the Treatment of Threadworms in Children |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=4839 |pages=755–7 |year=1953 |pmc=2029560 |pmid=13082101 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4839.755}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Standen O |title=Activity of Piperazine, in vitro, Against Ascaris lumbricoides |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=4930 |pages=20–2 |year=1955 |pmc=1980175 |pmid=14378628 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4930.20-a}}</ref> It was discovered that BZP had [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] and was largely abandoned as a worm treatment. It next appears in the literature in the 1970s when it was investigated as a potential [[antidepressant]] medication, but rejected when research reported that BZP had amphetamine-like effects and was liable to abuse. The study suggested that BZP “should be placed under statutory control similar to those regulating the use of amphetamine.”<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell H, Cline W, Evans M, Lloyd J, Peck A |title=Comparison of the effects of dexamphetamine and 1-benzylpiperazine in former addicts |journal=Eur J Clin Pharmacol |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=170–6 |year=1973 |pmid=4586849 |doi=10.1007/BF00558281}}</ref>

 
BZP has been shown to have a mixed mechanism of action, acting on the [[serotonin|serotonergic]] and [[dopamine]]rgic receptor systems in a similar fashion to [[MDMA]].<ref name=Baumann>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baumann M, Clark R, Budzynski A, Partilla J, Blough B, Rothman R |title=Effects of "Legal X" piperazine analogs on dopamine and serotonin release in rat brain |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume=1025 |pages=189–97 |year= 2004 |pmid=15542717 |doi=10.1196/annals.1316.024}}</ref> BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the [[monoamine transporter|serotonin reuptake transporter]], which increase serotonin concentrations in the [[extracellular fluid]]s surrounding the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors.<ref name=Tekes>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tekes K, Tóthfalusi L, Malomvölgyi B, Hermán F, Magyar K |title=Studies on the biochemical mode of action of EGYT-475, a new antidepressant |journal=Pol J Pharmacol Pharm |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=203–11 |pmid=2448760 |year=1987}}</ref> BZP has a lower potency effect on the [[monoamine transporter|noradrenaline reuptake transporter]] and the [[monoamine transporter|dopamine reuptake transporter]].<ref name=Baumann/> BZP has a high affinity action at the [[Adrenoceptor|alpha2-adrenoreceptor]], it is an antagonist at the receptor, like [[yohimbine]], which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released [[noradrenaline]].<ref name=" BilZ0r">{{cite web |author=BilZ0r |title=Neuropharmacology of BZP |publisher=Erowid.org |date=November 2003 |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bzp/bzp_article1.shtml |accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

 
BZP also acts as a non-selective [[serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]] on a wide variety of serotonin receptors;<ref name=Tekes/> binding to 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of [[migraine]] headaches.

 
== Effects ==

 
The effects of BZP are largely similar to [[amphetamine]]s,<ref name="Schep2011"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fantegrossi W, Winger G, Woods J, Woolverton W, Coop A |title=Reinforcing and discriminative stimulus effects of 1-benzylpiperazine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine in rhesus monkeys |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=161–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15664717 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.07.014}}</ref> with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts were unable to distinguish between [[dextroamphetamine]] and BZP administered intravenously.<ref name=Campbell /> Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being.

=== Toxic effects ===

 
As with most [[sympathomimetic]] [[stimulant]]s there appear to be significant side effects associated with BZP use. BZP reportedly produces insomnia and a mild to severe [[hangover]] after the drug effect wears off,<ref name="Nicholson-2006" /> however, some manufacturers in New Zealand have started including recovery pills which contain [[5-Hydroxytryptophan|5-HTP]] and vitamins which allegedly ease these hangovers.

 
The major side effects include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, [[pruritus]], [[confusion]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], tremor, extrapyramidal symptoms ([[dystonia]], [[akathisia]]), headache, [[dizziness]], anxiety, [[insomnia]], vomiting, [[chest pain]], [[hallucination]]s, [[paresthesia]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], [[palpitation]]s, collapse, [[hyperventilation]], sweating, [[hyperthermia]] and problems with [[urine retention]].<ref name="Schep2011"/><ref name="Nicholson-2006" /><ref name="Gee-2008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gee P, Gilbert M, Richardson S, Moore G, Paterson S, Graham P |title=Toxicity from the recreational use of 1-benzylpiperazine |journal=Clin Toxicol (Phila) |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=802–7 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18821145 |doi=10.1080/15563650802307602}}</ref><ref name="Gee-2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gee P, Richardson S, Woltersdorf W, Moore G |title=Toxic effects of BZP-based herbal party pills in humans: a prospective study in Christchurch, New Zealand |journal=[[The New Zealand Medical Journal|N Z Med J]] |volume=118 |issue=1227 |pages=U1784 |year=2005 |url=http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/118-1227/1784/content.pdf |pmid=16372033 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007080620/http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/118-1227/1784/content.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Theron-2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Theron L, Jansen K, Miles J |title=Benzylpiperizine-based party pills' impact on the Auckland City Hospital Emergency Department Overdose Database (2002–2004) compared with ecstasy (MDMA or methylene dioxymethamphetamine), gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), amphetamines, cocaine and alcohol |journal=[[The New Zealand Medical Journal|N Z Med J]] |volume=120 |issue=1249 |pages=U2416 |year=2007 |url=http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/120-1249/2416/content.pdf |pmid=17308553 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221915/http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/120-1249/2416/content.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohandas A, Vecchio D |title=A case report of Benzylpiperazine induced new onset affective symptoms in a patient with schizophrenia |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=23 |pages=S315–S316 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2008.01.1085}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Austin H, Monasterio E |title=Acute psychosis following ingestion of 'Rapture' |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=406–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15715818 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1665.2004.02137.x}}</ref> renal toxicity,<ref name=" Alansari-2006" /> [[respiratory failure]],<ref name="Schep2011"/> [[hyperthermia]],<ref name="Schep2011"/> [[serotonin syndrome]],<ref name="Schep2011"/> [[rhabdomyolysis]]<ref name="pmid20184432">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gee P, Jerram T, Bowie D |title=Multiorgan failure from 1-benzylpiperazine ingestion—legal high or lethal high? |journal=[[Clin Toxicol (Phila)]] |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=230–3 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20184432 |doi=10.3109/15563651003592948}}</ref> and [[seizure]].<ref name="Nicholson-2006" /><ref name="Gee-2005" /> Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or as part of a medicolegal death investigation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baselt, R. |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition=8|publisher=Biomedical Publications|place=Foster City, CA|year=2008|pages=155–156|isbn=0-931890-08-X}}</ref>

 
The majority of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the [[Emergency Department]] of [[Christchurch]] Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related to the use of benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic [[seizures]] were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening [[toxicity]] with [[status epilepticus]] and severe respiratory and [[metabolic acidosis]]. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects.<ref name="Gee-2005" /> The results of this study and others like it<ref name="Nicholson-2006" /><ref name="Theron-2007" /> showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.<ref name="Theron-2007" />

 
=== Addictive effects ===

 
One in every 45 (2.2%) last-year users of BZP in New Zealand is classed as dependent upon it, although 97.9% of users said that "it would not be difficult to stop using legal party pills", and 45.2% of people who reported using both BZP and illegal drugs such as [[methamphetamine]] reported that they used BZP so that they did not have to use methamphetamine, which was perceived as more harmful.<ref name="Wilkins">{{cite web|vauthors=Wilkins C, Girling M, Sweetsur P, Huckle T, Huakau J |title=Legal party pill use in New Zealand: Prevalence of use, availability, health harms and ‘gateway effects’ of benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluorophenylmethylpiperazine (TFMPP) |publisher=Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation (SHORE) |url=http://www.spiritualhigh.co.uk/spiritualhigh.co.uk/downloads/Legal-party-pills-in-New-Zealand-report.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318042503/http://www.spiritualhigh.co.uk/spiritualhigh.co.uk/downloads/Legal-party-pills-in-New-Zealand-report.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>

 
Studies undertaken on animals have indicated that BZP can substitute for methamphetamine in addicted rats, although it is one-tenth as potent and produces correspondingly weaker addictive effects.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brennan K, Johnstone A, Fitzmaurice P, Lea R, Schenk S |title=Chronic benzylpiperazine (BZP) exposure produces behavioral sensitization and cross-sensitization to methamphetamine (MA) |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=88 |issue=2–3 |pages=204–13 |year=2007 |pmid=17125936 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.10.016}}</ref>

 
Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be the subject of a [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may determine what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout [[European Union|the European Union]]. The [[risk assessment]] comes about as the result of a joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title =New drug under formal scrutiny: Council asks EMCDDA to assess risks of BZP|publisher = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|date = 23 March 2007|url =http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=public.AttachmentDownload&nNodeID=27522&slanguageISO=EN| format = PDF|accessdate = 2007-04-14}}</ref> The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown.
