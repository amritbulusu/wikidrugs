'''Ensaculin''' ('''KA-672''') is a drug from the [[coumarin]] family, which has been researched as a potential treatment for [[dementia]]. It acts on a number of receptor systems, being both a weak [[NMDA antagonist]] and a [[5HT1A receptor|5HT<sub>1A</sub>]] agonist.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lishko | first1 = PV | last2 = Maximyuk | first2 = OP | last3 = Chatterjee | first3 = SS | last4 = Nöldner | first4 = M | last5 = Krishtal | first5 = OA | title = The putative cognitive enhancer KA-672.HCl is an uncompetitive voltage-dependent NMDA receptor antagonist | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 9 | issue = 18 | pages = 4193–7 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9926872 | doi = 10.1097/00001756-199812210-00035 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Winter | first1 = JC | last2 = Helsley | first2 = SE | last3 = Rabin | first3 = RA | title = The discriminative stimulus effects of KA 672, a putative cognitive enhancer: evidence for a 5-HT1A component | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 703–7 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9678654 | doi=10.1016/S0091-3057(98)00043-4}}</ref> Animal studies have shown promising [[nootropic]] effects,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hoerr | first1 = R | last2 = Noeldner | first2 = M | title = Ensaculin (KA-672 HCl): a multitransmitter approach to dementia treatment | journal = CNS Drug Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–58 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12177685 | doi=10.1111/j.1527-3458.2002.tb00220.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Knauber | first1 = J | last2 = Müller | first2 = WE | title = Anseculin improves passive avoidance learning of aged mice | journal = Pharmacological research : the official journal of the Italian Pharmacological Society | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–33 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12591018 | doi=10.1016/S1043-6618(02)00311-0}}</ref> although efficacy in humans has yet to be proven.
