Like [[ritonavir]] (Norvir), cobicistat is of interest for its ability to inhibit liver enzymes that [[Metabolism|metabolize]] other medications used to treat HIV, notably [[elvitegravir]], an HIV [[integrase inhibitor]]. By combining cobicistat with elvitegravir, higher concentrations of the latter are achieved in the body with lower dosing, theoretically enhancing elvitegravir's viral suppression while diminishing its adverse side-effects. In contrast with ritonavir, the only other booster approved for use as a part of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HAART]], cobicistat has no anti-HIV activity of its own.<ref name = "Highleyman">Highleyman, L.

Cobicistat is a drug analogue of [[ritonavir]], in which the [[valine]] moiety is exchanged for a [[Morpholine|2-morpholinoethyl]] group, and the backbone [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]] group is removed. These changes effectively eliminate the anti-HIV activity of ritonavir while preserving its inhibitory effects on the [[CYP3A|CYP3A isozyme]] family of proteins.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ml1000257 | volume=1 | issue=5 | title=Cobicistat (GS-9350): A Potent and Selective Inhibitor of Human CYP3A as a Novel Pharmacoenhancer | year=2010 | journal=ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters | pages=209â€“213 | last1 = Xu | first1 = Lianhong | last2 = Liu | first2 = Hongtao | last3 = Murray | first3 = Bernard P. | last4 = Callebaut | first4 = Christian | last5 = Lee | first5 = Melody S. | last6 = Hong | first6 = Allen | last7 = Strickley | first7 = Robert G. | last8 = Tsai | first8 = Luong K. | last9 = Stray | first9 = Kirsten M. | last10 = Wang | first10 = Yujin | last11 = Rhodes | first11 = Gerry R. | last12 = Desai | first12 = Manoj C.}}</ref> Cobicistat is therefore able to increase plasma concentration of other coadministered anti-HIV drugs without the risk of causing cobicistat-resistant [[HIV drug resistance|mutations]] in the HIV virus.
