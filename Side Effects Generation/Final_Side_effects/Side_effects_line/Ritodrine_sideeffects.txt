==Side effects and potential contraindications==

 
Most side effects of β<sub>2</sub> agonists result from their concurrent β<sub>1</sub> activity, and include increase in heart rate, rise in systolic pressure, decrease in diastolic pressure, chest pain secondary to myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. Beta agonists may also cause fluid retention secondary to decrease in water clearance, which when added to the [[tachycardia]] and increased [[Cardiac muscle|myocardial]] work, may result in [[heart failure]]. In addition, they increase [[gluconeogenesis]] in the liver and muscle resulting in hyperglycemia, which increases insulin requirements in diabetic patients. The passage of β agonists through the placenta does occur and may be responsible for fetal tachycardia, as well as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia at birth.
