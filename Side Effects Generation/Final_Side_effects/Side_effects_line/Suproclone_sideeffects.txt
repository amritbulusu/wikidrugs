Suproclone is very similar in structure to the related drug [[suriclone]], but little information has been published about it specifically. However it can be expected that the mechanism of action by which suproclone produces its sedative and anxiolytic effects is by modulating benzodiazepine receptors (resulting in an increased response to endogenous [[GABA]]), in a similar manner to other drugs of this class.<ref>Colin R.
