'''Rivanicline''' ('''TC-2403''', '''RJR-2403''', '''(E)-metanicotine''') is a drug which acts as a [[partial agonist]] at neural [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s. It is subtype-selective, binding primarily to the [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|α4β2]] [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor#Subunits|subtype]]. It has [[nootropic]] effects and was originally developed as a potential treatment for [[Alzheimer's disease]],<ref>Jang J, Sin KS, Park H.

''Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine''. 2006 Dec;142(6):700-2. {{PMID|17603674}}</ref> but a second action that was subsequently found was that it inhibits the production of [[Interleukin-8]] and thus produces an [[antiinflammatory]] effect, and so it has also been developed as a potential treatment for [[ulcerative colitis]].<ref>Spoettl T, Paetzel C, Herfarth H, Bencherif M, Schoelmerich J, Greinwald R, Gatto GJ, Rogler G.
