JWH-073 has been shown to produce behavioral effects very similar to [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] in animals.<ref name="DEA">{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/spice/spice_jwh073.html |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803203526/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/spice/spice_jwh073.html |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}</ref>

 
Its effects are produced by binding and acting as an agonist to the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> cannabinoid receptors. The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is found in the brain. JWH-073 bind to CB<sub>1</sub> with a higher affinity than THC, suggesting that taking more too soon after the initial dose could lead to diminished effects. CB<sub>2</sub> is found outside the brain, mostly in the immune system. The binding with CB<sub>2</sub> receptors has been shown to be similar between JWH-073 and THC.<ref name="DEA" />

 
A search in the literature yielded no published studies of the effects of JWH-073 in humans, but these studies in animals suggest with high probability that JWH-073 produces effects very similar to those of THC in humans.<ref name="DEA" />
