'''Pentamorphone''' ('''14Î²-pentylaminomorphinone''', '''RX-77989''') is a semi-synthetic [[opiate]] derivative related to compounds such as [[morphine]], [[hydromorphone]] and [[oxymorphone]]. Developed in 1984, it is a potent opioid [[analgesic]] several times stronger than [[fentanyl]], and with a similarly fast onset of effects and short duration of action.<ref>Glass PS, Camporesi EM, Shafron D, Quill T, Reves JG.
