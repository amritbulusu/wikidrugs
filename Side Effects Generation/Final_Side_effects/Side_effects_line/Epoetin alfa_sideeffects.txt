== Adverse effects ==

 
Epoetin alfa is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include high blood pressure, headache, disabling cluster migraine (resistant to remedies), joint pain, and clotting at the injection site. Rare cases of stinging at the injection site, skin rash, and [[flu-like symptoms]] (joint and muscle pain) have occurred within a few hours following administration. More serious side effects, including allergic reactions, seizures and thrombotic events (e.g., heart attacks, strokes, and pulmonary embolism) rarely occur. Chronic self-administration of the drug has been shown to cause increases in blood [[hemoglobin]] and [[hematocrit]] to abnormally high levels, resulting in [[dyspnea]] and abdominal pain.<ref>R.

Several publications and FDA communications have increased the level of concern related to adverse effects of ESA therapy in selected groups. In a revised black box warning, the FDA notes significant risks, advising that ESAs should be used only in patients with cancer when treating anemia specifically caused by chemotherapy, and not for other causes of anemia. Further, the warning states that ESAs should be discontinued once the patient's chemotherapy course has been completed.<ref name="urlMedWatch - 2007 Safety Information Alerts">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/safety07.htm#ESA2 |title=Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents: Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa), Epogen (epoetin alfa), and Procrit (epoetin alfa) |date=2008-01-03 |format= |work=MedWatch - 2007 Safety Information Alerts |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |pages= |language= |quote= |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409003452/http://www.fda.gov/MedWatch/safety/2007/safety07.htm |archivedate=April 9, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="urlwww.fda.gov_ Procrit">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2007/103234s5158lbl.pdf |title=Procrit (Epoetin alfa) for injection |date=2007-08-11 |format= |work= |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118031036/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2007/103234s5158lbl.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2009 |quote= |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes }}</ref><ref name="urlwww.fda.gov_ Aranesp">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2007/103951s5164lbl.pdf |title=Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) for Injection |date=2007-11-08 |format= |work= |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118031507/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2007/103951s5164lbl.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2009 |quote= |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes }}</ref><ref name="urlInformation on Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) (marketed as Procrit, Epogen, and Aranesp)">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/RHE/default.htm | title = Information on Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) (marketed as Procrit, Epogen, and Aranesp) | date = 2009-01-26 | work = | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | pages = | language = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-04-09}}</ref>
