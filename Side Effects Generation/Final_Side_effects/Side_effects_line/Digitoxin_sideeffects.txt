'''Digitoxin''' is a [[cardiac glycoside]]. It is a [[phytosteroid]] and is similar in [[chemical structure|structure]] and effects to [[digoxin]] (though the effects are longer-lasting). Unlike digoxin (which is eliminated from the body via the kidneys), it is eliminated via the liver, so could be used in patients with poor or erratic kidney function. However, it is now rarely used in current Western medical practice.  While several controlled trials have shown digoxin to be effective in a proportion of patients treated for heart failure, the evidence base for digitoxin is not as strong, although it is presumed to be similarly effective.<ref name=Belz>{{cite journal |author1=Belz, G.

Digitoxin exhibits similar toxic effects to the more commonly used [[digoxin]], namely: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, visual disturbances, and cardiac [[arrhythmias]].  Antidigoxin antibody fragments, the specific treatment for digoxin poisoning, are also effective in serious digitoxin toxicity.<ref name=Kurowsky>{{cite journal |author1=Kurowski, V. |author2=Iven, H. |author3=Djonlagic, H. | title = Treatment of a patient with severe digitoxin intoxication by Fab fragments of anti-digitalis antibodies | journal = Intensive Care Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 439–442 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1469187 | doi = 10.1007/BF01694351 }}</ref>
