Other tachykinins from nonmammalian sources include [[kassinin]] and [[physalaemin]]. The mammalian tachykinins [[substance P]], NKA, and NKB have similar effects as tachykinins of nonmammals and have been more widely studied and characterized.  These peptides exhibit a wide and complex spectrum of pharmacological and physiological activities such as [[vasodilation]], [[hypertension]], and stimulation of extravascular [[smooth muscle]].<ref name="grace">R.
