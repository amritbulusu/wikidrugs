In 1951 the "Speedy" character was introduced. The character was created by ad writer Chuck Tenant and designed by commercial artist Bob Watkins, both of the Wade Advertising agency.<ref>http://advertisingiconmuseum.org/inside/c5/3249039.html</ref>  Originally named Sparky, the name was changed to Speedy by sales manager Perry L. Shupert to align with that year's promotional theme, "Speedy Relief."  Speedy appeared in over 200 TV commercials between 1954 and 1964.  His body was one Alka-Seltzer tablet, while he wore another as a hat.  In his original spots he sang "Relief is just a swallow away"; in his 1978 revival he proclaimed Alka-Seltzer's virtues and sang the "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is" song in his high, squeaky voice (provided by veteran juvenile voice actor [[Dick Beals]]).<ref name="75thAnniversary">{{cite web|url=http://www.alkaseltzer.com/as/faqs.html|title=Alka-Seltzer FAQs|work=alkaseltzer.com}}</ref>  In the early 1960s a commercial showing two tablets dropping into a glass of water instead of the usual one caused sales to double.<ref name="snopes">{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/alka-seltzer.asp|title=Alka-Seltzer Marketing : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=29 January 2016|work=snopes}}</ref> In December 2010 Alka-Seltzer began a series of new commercials featuring Speedy, using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects to recreate the [[stop-motion]] puppetry of the 1950s and 1960s, with Speedy voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]].
