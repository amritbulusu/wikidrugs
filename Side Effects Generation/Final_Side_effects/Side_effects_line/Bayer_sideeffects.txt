There has been controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin.  [[Arthur Eichengrün]], a Bayer chemist, claimed to be the first to discover an [[aspirin]] formulation which did not have the unpleasant [[adverse effect|side effects]] of [[nausea]] and [[gastric pain]]. Eichengrün also claimed that he invented the name aspirin and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by [[Felix Hoffmann]] to alleviate the sufferings of his father, who had [[arthritis]]. Various sources support the conflicting claims.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Annual Conference Press Release.pdf|date=1999|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|url=http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|quote=Jewish Scientist's Claim to Discover Aspirin Denied by Nazis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528215006/http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrp.org/testimonypresentations/EPApesticide.php |title=Should EPA Accept Human Pesticide Experiments |publisher=Ahrp.org |accessdate=2011-06-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110614104951/http://www.ahrp.org/testimonypresentations/EPApesticide.php| archivedate= 14 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Felix Hoffmann and/or Arthur Eichengrün.<ref name="Sneader W 2000 1591–4">{{cite journal |author=Sneader W |title=The discovery of aspirin: a reappraisal |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1591–4 |year=2000 |pmid=11124191 |pmc=1119266 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1591|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mahdi JG, Mahdi AJ, Mahdi AJ, Bowen ID |title=The historical analysis of aspirin discovery, its relation to the willow tree and antiproliferative and anticancer potential |journal=Cell Prolif. |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=147–55 |date=April 2006  |pmid=16542349 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00377.x |url=}}</ref>

 
In the 1960s, Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, [[Primodos]], that consisted of two pills that contained [[norethisterone]] (as acetate) and [[ethinylestradiol]]. It detected pregnancy by inducing [[menstruation]] in women who were not pregnant. The presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for [[birth defect]]s, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s.  Litigation in the 1980s regarding these claims ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date, and concluded that it found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.<ref name=MHRAreview2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-ic/documents/websiteresources/con404471.pdf|title=

 
* ''Xarelto'' ([[rivaroxaban]]) is a small molecule inhibitor of [[Factor X]]a, a key enzyme involved in [[Coagulation|blood coagulation]].  In the United States, the FDA has approved rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke in people with [[atrial fibrillation]], for the treatment of [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]], and for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing hip surgery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/022406s004lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Rivaroxaban competes with other newer generation anticoagulants such as [[apixaban]] and [[dabigatran]] as well as with the generic anticoagulant warfarin.  It has similar efficacy to warfarin and is associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding, but unlike warfarin there is no established protocol for rapidly reversing its effects in the event of uncontrolled bleeding or the need for emergency surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sardar P, Chatterjee S, Wu WC, Lichstein E, Ghosh J, Aikat S, Mukherjee D |title=New oral anticoagulants are not superior to warfarin in secondary prevention of stroke or transient ischemic attacks, but lower the risk of intracranial bleeding: insights from a meta-analysis and indirect treatment comparisons |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=e77694 |year=2013 |pmid=24204920 |pmc=3808395 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0077694 |url=}}</ref>

Neonicotinoid use has been linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including [[honey-bee]] [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cressey | first1 = D. | title = Europe debates risk to bees | doi = 10.1038/496408a | journal = Nature | volume = 496 | issue = 7446 | pages = 408 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23619669| pmc = }}<br/>{{Cite journal | last1 = Gill | first1 = R.
