The inhibitory binding of Carlumab to CCL2 was hypothesized to inhibit [[angiogenesis]] and consequently modulate tumor cell proliferation.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> Studies focusing on the effects of Carlumab have been performed in vitro on cell lines and in vivo on mice and in humans including phase 1 and phase 2 [[clinical trial]]s evaluating the efficacy, safety and dose requirements of the drug. Clinical trials for Carlumab include studies of idiopathic [[pulmonary fibrosis]],<ref>{{Cite journal|title=http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2013.187.1_MeetingAbstracts.A3376|url=http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2013.187.1_MeetingAbstracts.A3376|doi=10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2013.187.1_meetingabstracts.a3376}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00786201?term=CNTO-888&rank=1|title=A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of CNTO 888 Administered Intravenously (IV) in Participants With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref> castration-resistant metastatic [[prostate cancer]]<ref name="Pienta 760–768"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00992186?term=CNTO-888&rank=4|title=A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Single-agent Carlumab (an Anti-Chemokine Ligand 2 [CCL2]) in Participants With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref> and solid tumors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sandhu|first=Shahneen K.|last2=Papadopoulos|first2=Kyri|last3=Fong|first3=Peter C.|last4=Patnaik|first4=Amita|last5=Messiou|first5=Christina|last6=Olmos|first6=David|last7=Wang|first7=George|last8=Tromp|first8=Brenda J.|last9=Puchalski|first9=Thomas A.|date=2013-04-01|title=A first-in-human, first-in-class, phase I study of carlumab (CNTO 888), a human monoclonal antibody against CC-chemokine ligand 2 in patients with solid tumors|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23385782|journal=Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology|volume=71|issue=4|pages=1041–1050|doi=10.1007/s00280-013-2099-8|issn=1432-0843|pmid=23385782}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00537368?term=CNTO-888&rank=3|title=First Study of the Safety of CNTO 888 in Patients With Solid Tumors - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref>
