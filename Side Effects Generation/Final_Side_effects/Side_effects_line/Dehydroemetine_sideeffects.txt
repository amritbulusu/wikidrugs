'''Dehydroemetine''' is a synthetically produced [[antiprotozoal agent]] similar to [[emetine]] in its anti-amoebic properties and structure (they differ only in a double bond next to the ethyl substituent), but it produces fewer side effects. In the United States, it is manufactured by [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]].

 
# A 1986 in vitro study compared the effects of dehydroemetine, metronidazole, ornidazole, and secnidazole on ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''. Metronidazole was found to be most effective, and the other three drugs were of similar effectiveness.<ref name="pmid2883732">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chintana T, Sucharit P, Mahakittikun V, Siripanth C, Suphadtanaphongs W |title=In vitro studies on the sensitivity of local Entamoeba histolytica to anti-amoebic drugs |journal=Southeast Asian J.
