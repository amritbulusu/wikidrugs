Phase IIb data presented at the 20th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in March 2013 showed similar viral suppression rates of 76% for patients taking 100&nbsp;mg cenicriviroc, 73% with 200&nbsp;mg cenicriviroc, and 71% with [[efavirenz]]. Non-response rates were higher with cenicriviroc, however, largely due to greater drop-out of patients. A new tablet formulation with lower pill burden may improve adherence. Looking at immune and inflammatory biomarkers, levels of [[CCL2|MCP-1]] increased and soluble [[CD14]] decreased in the cenicriviroc arms.<ref>[http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/hiv-aids/hiv-aids-topics/hiv-treatment/4009-croi-2013-dual-ccr5ccr2-inhibitor-cenicriviroc-has-both-anti-hiv-and-anti-inflammatory-effects CROI 2013: CCR5/CCR2 Inhibitor Cenicriviroc Has Both Anti-HIV and Anti-inflammatory Effects].
