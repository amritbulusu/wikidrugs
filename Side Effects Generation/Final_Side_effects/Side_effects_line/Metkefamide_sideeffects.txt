Despite its [[peptide|peptidic]] nature, upon [[systemic administration]], metkefamide rapidly penetrates the [[blood-brain-barrier]] and disperses into the [[central nervous system]] where it produces potent, centrally-mediated [[analgesic]] effects,<ref name="pmid6123675">{{cite journal |vauthors=Calimlim JF, Wardell WM, Sriwatanakul K, Lasagna L, Cox C | title = Analgesic efficacy of parenteral metkephamid acetate in treatment of postoperative pain | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8286 | pages = 1374–5 |date=June 1982 | pmid = 6123675 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(82)92497-7| url = }}</ref> of which have been shown to be dependent on activity at both the μ- and δ-opioid receptors.<ref name="pmid6256856" /><ref name="pmid6292609">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hynes MD, Frederickson RC | title = Cross-tolerance studies distinguish morphine- and metkephamid-induced analgesia | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 12-13 | pages = 1201–4 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6292609 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(82)90342-3| url = }}</ref> In addition, on account of modifications to the [[N-terminus|N-]] and [[C-terminus|C-terminals]], metkefamide is highly stable against [[proteolysis|proteolytic degradation]] relative to many other opioid peptides.<ref name="Lee1991"/><ref name="MathiowitzChickering1999">{{cite book | author1 = Edith Mathiowitz | author2 = Donald E.

Likely on account of its δ-opioid activity, [[clinical trial]]s have found metkefamide to possess less of a tendency for producing many of the undesirable [[side effect]]s usually associated with conventional opioids such as [[respiratory depression]], [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], and [[physical dependence]].<ref name="pmid6256856" /><ref name="Stein1990">{{cite book | author = Stanley Stein | title = Fundamentals of Protein Biotechnology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a-er5mhepr8C&pg=PA17 | accessdate = 27 April 2012 | date = 31 August 1990 | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 978-0-8247-8346-4 | page = 17}}</ref> However, it has been shown to cause some additional side effects that are considered unusual for standard opioid analgesics like [[sensations of heaviness in the extremities]] and [[nasal congestion]]—though these were not considered to be particularly distressing<ref name="pmid6123675" />—and it has also been shown to raise the [[seizure threshold]] in animals.<ref name="pmid6319916">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tortella FC, Robles LE, Holaday JW, Cowan A | title = A selective role for delta-receptors in the regulation of opioid-induced changes in seizure threshold | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 33 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = 603–6 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6319916 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(83)90575-1| url = }}</ref> In any case, clinical development was not further pursued after [[Phases of clinical research|phase I]] clinical studies and metkefamide never reached the pharmaceutical market.<ref name="Bailey1987">{{cite book | author = Denis M.
