== Side effects ==

 
The safety of Novolog in patients with diabetes has been evaluated in several clinical studies.  Novolog was compared with regular human insulin, and there was no difference in the frequency of adverse effects between the two treatments.  The side effects that are commonly associated with insulin therapy include: allergic reactions, injection site irritation, rashes, and [[hypoglycemia]].<ref name= www.novolog.com /> The most common side effect is hypoglycemia.  Long-term use of insulin, including Novolog®, can cause [[lipodystrophy]] at the site of repeated injections or infusion. To reduce the risk of lipodystrophy, rotate the injection sites within the same region.  Weight gain can also occur with the use of Novolog® and it has been attributed to anabolic effects of insulin and a decrease in [[glucosuria]]. Use of Novolog® has also been associated with sodium retention and [[edema]].<ref name="www.novo-pi.com" />
