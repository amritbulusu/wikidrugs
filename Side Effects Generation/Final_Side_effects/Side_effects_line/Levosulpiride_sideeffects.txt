In contrast to most other neuroleptics which block both dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors, sulpiride is more selective and acts primarily as a dopamine D<sub>2</sub> antagonist. Sulpiride appears to lack effects on norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. <ref>http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00391</ref>
