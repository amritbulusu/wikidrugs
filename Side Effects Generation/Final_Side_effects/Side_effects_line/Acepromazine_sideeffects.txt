The standard pharmaceutical preparation, acepromazine maleate, is used in [[veterinary medicine]] in dogs, and cats. It is used widely in horses as a pre-anesthetic sedative and has been shown to reduce anesthesia related death.<ref name="Dugdale 2016"/> However, it should be used with caution (but is not absolutely [[contraindicated]]) in stallions due to the risk of [[paraphimosis]] and persistent [[priapism]].<ref name=plumb /> Its potential for cardiac effects, namely [[hypotension]] due to peripheral vasodilation, can be profound and as such is not recommended for use in geriatric or debilitated animals.<ref name=forney>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wedgewoodpetrx.com/learning-center/professional-monographs/acepromazine-maleate-for-veterinary-use.html|title=Acepromazine Maleate for Veterinary Use|last=Forney|first=Barbara|date=|website=Wedgewood pharmacy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}</ref>

 
The clinical pharmacology of acepromazine is similar to that of other phenothiazine derived anti-psychotic agents. The primary behavioral effects are attributed to its potent antagonism of post-synaptic [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s and, to a lesser degree, the other [[D2-like receptor|D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor]]s. Additional effects are related to its appreciable antagonistic effects on various other receptors, including the [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub> receptors]], [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptors]], and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|mACh receptor]]s. It is metabolized by the liver, oxidized to produce its primary metabolite, hydroxyethylpromazine sulfoxide, which is then excreted in the urine.<ref name=choudhary>{{Cite web | last=Choudhary | first=Gargi | title=Determination of Acepromazine and its Major Metabolite in Equine Serum by LC-MS/MS using the Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer | url=http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/brochures/App-Note-318-Determination-of-Acepromazine-and-its-Major-Metabolite-in-Equine-Serum.pdf | publisher=Thermo Electron Corporation}}</ref><ref name=smallvet>{{cite book | editor-first=Jill E. |editor-last=Maddison |editor2-first=Stephen W. | editor2-last=Page |editor3-first=David | editor3-last=Church | title=Small Animal Clinical Pharmacology | location=Edinburgh; New York | date=2008 | edition=2 | publisher=Saunders/Elsevier | isbn=9780702028588 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RpsROVqemk8C&lpg=PA115}}</ref>{{rp|115}} Its action at the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] (in the [[area postrema]]) and the [[solitary nucleus]] (in the [[medulla oblongata]]) allow it to have an antiemetic effect.<ref name=valverde>{{cite journal | last1=Valverde | first1=A | last2=Cantwell | first2=S | last3=Hernández | first3=J | last4=Brotherson | first4=C | title=Effects of acepromazine on the incidence of vomiting associated with opioid administration in dogs | journal=Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia | date=April 2003 | doi=10.1046/j.1467-2995.2003.01331.x | issn=1467-2987 | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=99 | url=http://www.vaajournal.org/article/S1467-2987(16)30962-X/fulltext}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kolahian|first=Saeed|title=Efficacy of Different Antiemetics with Different Mechanism of Action on Xylazine Induced Emesis in Cats| journal=Iranian Journal of Veterinary Surgery | year=2014 | volume=9 | number=1 | url=http://www.ivsajournals.com/article_5789_6e9336886fafc7a62f1c710ade9bc1ef.pdf | page=10}}</ref>

 
The most common uses of acepromazine in animals are as an oral sedative before stressful events (such as thunderstorms), an injectable tranquilizer for particularly aggressive or fractious animal, and when combined with [[opiates]], a [[premedication]] or a post-operative pain reliever. Its effects as a [[CNS depressant]] means that less opiates are required to reach the same amount of sedation, and it prevents the [[arrhythmia]] and vomiting that many opiates induce. Its use as an oral sedative is somewhat controversial; acepromazine can increase sensitivity to noise and cause exaggerated startle reflexes. The [[dysphoric]] effect of phenothiazines and this increase in sensitivity can make some aggressive dogs and fractious cats more so.<ref name=drugs.com>{{Cite web | title=Acepromazine Maleate Injection for Animal Use | work=Drugs.com | accessdate=2017-06-11 | url=https://www.drugs.com/vet/acepromazine-maleate-injection.html}}</ref><ref name=1800petmeds>{{Cite web | title=Acepromazine: Pet Anxiety Medication for Dogs & Cats | work=1800PetMeds | accessdate=2017-06-11 | url=https://www.1800petmeds.com/Acepromazine-prod10209.html}}</ref><ref name=khuly>{{Cite web | last=Khuly | first=Patty | title=Acepromazine: Why I'm not a big fan when it comes to sedation via 'ace' | work=PetMD | accessdate=2017-06-12 | date=2009-10-22 | url=http://www.petmd.com/blogs/fullyvetted/2009/october/acepromazine-why-im-not-big-fan-when-it-comes-sedation-ace-6937}}</ref><ref name=smallvet />{{rp|116,130}}

====Adverse effects in dogs====

 
In [[Giant dog breed|giant-breed dog]]s and [[sighthound]]s, the sedative effects of acepromazine may last for 12–24 hours, which is much longer than the usual 3–4 hours.<ref name=brooks /><ref name="Ettinger 2010"/>

 
====Adverse effects====

 
Side effects are not common, but the use of acepromazine in [[stallions]] should be used with caution (but is not absolutely [[contraindicated]]) due to the risk of [[paraphimosis]] and [[priapism]].<ref name=plumb>{{cite book |last=Plumb |first=Donald C. |date=2011 |title=Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook, 7th ed. |url=http://www.plumbsonline.com |location=Ames, Iowa |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=4–5 |isbn=978-0-4709-5965-7}}</ref>
