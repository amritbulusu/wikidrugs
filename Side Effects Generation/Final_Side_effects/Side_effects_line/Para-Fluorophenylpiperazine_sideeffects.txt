pFPP has little stimulant effects, with its subjective effects derived mainly from its action as a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist.<ref>Scherman D, Hamon M, Gozlan H, Henry JP, Lesage A, Masson M, Rumigny JF. Molecular pharmacology of niaprazine. Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry. 1988;12(6):989-1001.</ref> pFPP is active at doses between 20 and 150&nbsp;mg, but higher doses cause a range of side-effects such as [[migraine]] [[headache]]s, [[muscle ache]]s, [[anxiety]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]]. Metabolic studies have shown pFPP to be an inhibitor of various [[Cytochrome P450]] enzymes in the liver which may contribute to its side-effect profile.<ref name="pmid19589229">{{cite journal |vauthors=Antia U, Tingle MD, Russell BR |title=Metabolic interactions with piperazine-based 'party pill' drugs |journal=The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology |volume=61 |issue=7 |pages=877–82 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19589229 |doi=10.1211/jpp/61.07.0006 |url=}}</ref>
