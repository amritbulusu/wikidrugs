In addition to its actions as an antihistamine, captodiamine has been found to act as a [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] and [[sigma-1 receptor|σ<sub>1</sub> receptor]] and [[D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]].<ref name="pmid23863923">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ring RM, Regan CM | title = Captodiamine, a putative antidepressant, enhances hypothalamic BDNF expression in vivo by synergistic 5-HT2c receptor antagonism and sigma-1 receptor agonism | journal = J.
