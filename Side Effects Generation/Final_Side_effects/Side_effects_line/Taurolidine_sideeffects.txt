'''Taurolidine''' is an [[antimicrobial]] that is used to try to prevent infections in catheters.<ref name=Li2013/> Side effects and the induction of bacterial resistance is uncommon.<ref name=Li2013/> It is also being studied as a treatment for [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neary|first1=PM|last2=Hallihan|first2=P|last3=Wang|first3=JH|last4=Pfirrmann|first4=RW|last5=Bouchier-Hayes|first5=DJ|last6=Redmond|first6=HP|title=The evolving role of taurolidine in cancer therapy.|journal=Annals of Surgical Oncology|date=April 2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=1135–43|pmid=20039217|doi=10.1245/s10434-009-0867-9}}</ref>

 
== Side effects ==

 
No systemic side effects have been identified. The safety of taurolidine has also been confirmed in clinical studies with long-term intravenous administration of high doses (up to 20 g daily). In the body, taurolidine is metabolized rapidly via the metabolites taurultam and methylol taurinamide, which also have a bactericidal action, to taurine, an endogenous aminosulphonic acid, CO2 and H2O. Therefore, no toxic effects are known or expected in the event of accidental injection. Burning sensation while instilling, numbness, erythema, facial flushing, headache, epistaxis, nausea <ref name=":11" />

 
Taurolidine binding to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prevents microbial adherence to host epithelial cells, thereby prevents microbial invasion of uninfected host cells. Although the mechanism underlying its antineoplastic activity has not been fully elucidated, it may be related to this agent's anti-adherence property.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Gorman|first=S.P.|last2=McCafferty|date=1987|title=Reduced adherence of micro-organisms to human mucosal epithelial cells following treatment with Taurolin, a novel antimicrobial agent|journal=J Appl Bacteriol  |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=315–20|display-authors=etal|pmid=3298185 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.1987.tb04926.x}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Blenkharn|first=J.I.|date=1989|title=Anti-adherence properties of taurolidine and noxythiolin.|journal=J Chemother |volume=1 |issue=Suppl 4|pages=233–4}}</ref> Taurolidine has been shown to block Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bedrosian|first=I.|last2=Sofia|first2=R.D.|date=1991|title=Taurolidine, an analogue of the amino acid taurine, suppresses interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells|journal=Cytokine  |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=568–75|display-authors=etal|pmid=1790304 |doi=10.1016/1043-4666(91)90483-t}}</ref> In addition, taurolidine also promotes apoptosis by inducing various apoptotic factors and suppresses the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=Jacobi|first=CA|last2=Menenakos|first2=C.|last3=Braumann|first3=C.|date=October 2005|title=Taurolidine--a new drug with anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects|journal=Anticancer Drugs  |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=917–21|doi=10.1097/01.cad.0000176502.40810.b0|pmid=16162968}}</ref>
