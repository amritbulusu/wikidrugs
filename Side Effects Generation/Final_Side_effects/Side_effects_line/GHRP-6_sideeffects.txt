GH secretagogues differ from exogenous rHGH in their effects primarily because endogenous GH contains all five isoforms of growth hormone, whereas exogenous GH contains only the 20 kilodalton isoform. Different isoforms affect tissues in discreet ways that the 20 kDa isoform cannot. Administration of GH secretagogues causes a pulse-release of GH from the pituitary which is cleared from the body within a few hours. This does not significantly raise plasma [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) levels.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
