DOET is in a class of compounds commonly known as [[substituted amphetamine]]s; its full chemical name is 4-ethyl-2,5-dimethoxy-alpha-methylbenzeneethanamine, or 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenyl)propan-2-amine. It has an active [[stereocenter]] and (R)-DOET is the more active enantiomer. DOET is an extremely rare compound and reports of its effects and toxicology in humans are sparse.  However, like the more common 2,5-dimethoxy-amphetamine analogues DOB, DOI and DOM, it is a potent and long-acting psychedelic.  Removal of the alpha-methyl moiety yields the 2-carbon analogue, commonly known as [[2C-E]], another psychedelic compound first synthesized by Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]].

 
== Effects ==

 
DOET produces psychedelic effects that last up 14-20 hours. In PiHKAL, Shulgin lists the dosage of DOET as being 2-7 mg orally, with 6-7 mg being the dosage for full, desired effects.<ref name="PiHKAL">{{cite book | title = PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story | last = Shulgin | first = Alexander |author2= Shulgin, Ann   | publisher = Transform Press | location = United States | isbn = 0-9630096-0-5 | pages = 978 | url = https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml |date= September 1991}}</ref>
