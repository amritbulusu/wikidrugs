It [[Competitive antagonist|competitively]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonizes]] the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|M<sub>1</sub>]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2|M<sub>2</sub>]], and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M<sub>3</sub>]] subtypes of the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]. It also has direct [[muscle relaxant#Spasmolytics|spasmolytic]] effects on bladder smooth muscle as a [[Voltage-gated calcium channel|calcium antagonist]] and local anesthetic, but at concentrations far above those used clinically.

 
Oxybutynin contains one [[Chirality (chemistry)|stereocenter]]. Commercial formulations are sold as the [[Racemic|racemate]]. The [[Enantiomer|(''R'')-enantiomer]] is a more potent anticholinergic than either the racemate or the (''S'')-enantiomer, which is essentially without anticholinergic activity at doses used in clinical practice.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kachur JF | year = 1988 | title = R and S enantiomers of oxybutynin: pharmacological effects in guinea pig bladder and intestine | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 247 | issue = | pages = 867–72 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Noronha-Blob L, Kachur JF | year = 1991 | title = Enantiomers of oxybutynin: in vitro pharmacological characterization at M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub> muscarinic receptors and in vivo effects on urinary bladder contraction, mydriasis and salivary secretion in guinea pigs | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 256 | issue = | pages = 562–7 }}</ref> However, (''R'')-oxybutynin administered alone offers little or no clinical benefit above and beyond the racemic mixture. The other actions (calcium antagonism, local anesthesia) of oxybutynin are not stereospecific. (''S'')-Oxybutynin has not been clinically tested for its spasmolytic effects, but may be clinically useful for the same indications as the racemate, without the unpleasant anticholinergic side effects.

 
== Adverse effects ==

 
Common adverse effects that are associated with oxybutynin and other [[anticholinergics]] include: dry mouth, difficulty in [[urination]], constipation, blurred vision, drowsiness, and dizziness.<ref>Mehta D (Ed.) 2006. [[British National Formulary]] 51. Pharmaceutical Press. {{ISBN|0-85369-668-3}}</ref> Anticholinergics have also been known to induce [[delirium]].<ref>Andreasen NC and Black DW, "Introductory Textbook of Psychiatry."

These are dose-related and sometimes severe. In one population studied—after six months, more than half of the patients had stopped taking the medication because of side effects{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and calcium defects. An intake of calcium of 800 to 1000&nbsp;mg is suggested.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Dry mouth may be particularly severe; one estimate is that over a quarter of patients who begin oxybutynin treatment may have to stop because of dry mouth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

 
Oxybutynin's tendency to reduce sweating can be dangerous. Reduced sweating increases the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke in apparently safe situations where normal sweating keep others safe and comfortable. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0011534/?report=details#warning</ref> Adverse effects of elevated body temperature are more likely for the elderly and for those with health issues, especially multiple sclerosis. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23599395/?i=4&from=/20671034/related</ref>

 
''N''-Desethyloxybutynin is an active metabolite of oxybutynin that is thought responsible for much of the adverse effects associated with the use of oxybutynin.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Allen B.

The long-acting formulations also allow once-daily administration instead of the twice-daily dosage required with the immediate-release form. The transdermal patch, in addition to the benefits of the extended-release oral formulations, bypasses the [[First pass effect|first-pass hepatic effect]] that the oral formulations are subject to.<ref>Oki T, et al. "Advantages for Transdermal over Oral Oxybutynin to Treat Overactive Bladder: Muscarinic Receptor Binding, Plasma Drug Concentration, and Salivary Secretion". ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics'' Fast Forward 316:1137-1145, 2006.</ref>  In those with overflow incontinence because of diabetes or neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord trauma, oxybutynin can worsen overflow incontinence since the fundamental problem is that the bladder is not contracting.

 
Oxybutynin chloride exerts direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. It exhibits one-fifth of the [[anticholinergic]] activity of [[atropine]] on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects).
