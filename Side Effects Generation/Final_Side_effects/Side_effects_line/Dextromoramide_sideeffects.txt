The main advantage of this drug is that it has a fast onset of action when taken orally, and has a high bioavailability which means that oral dosing produces almost as much effect as injection. It also has a relatively low tendency to cause [[constipation]] which is a common problem with opioid analgesics used for [[cancer pain]] relief, and tolerance to the analgesic effects develops relatively slowly compared to most other short-acting opioids.<ref>''Addictive Behaviours''. 1999 Sep-Oct;24(5):707-13. {{PMID|10574310}}</ref>

 
Dextromoramide was discovered during the course of research into a related family of compounds, the α,α-Diphenyl-γ-Dialkyamino-Butyramides, which show no analgesic activity, but are extremely active physiologically as inhibitors of gastric secretions in man. Other drugs from this series show antispasmodic and antihistamine effects, but most research was put into researching analgesics.
