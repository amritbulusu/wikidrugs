A 2014 Cochrane review did not find a difference between bevacizumab and ranibizumab in deaths or total severe side effects when used for macular degeneration.<ref name=Moja2014>{{cite journal|last1=Moja|first1=L|last2=Lucenteforte|first2=E|last3=Kwag|first3=KH|last4=Bertele|first4=V|last5=Campomori|first5=A|last6=Chakravarthy|first6=U|last7=D'Amico|first7=R|last8=Dickersin|first8=K|last9=Kodjikian|first9=L|last10=Lindsley|first10=K|last11=Loke|first11=Y|last12=Maguire|first12=M|last13=Martin|first13=DF|last14=Mugelli|first14=A|last15=Mühlbauer|first15=B|last16=Püntmann|first16=I|last17=Reeves|first17=B|last18=Rogers|first18=C|last19=Schmucker|first19=C|last20=Subramanian|first20=ML|last21=Virgili|first21=G|title=Systemic safety of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Sep 15, 2014|volume=9|pages=CD011230|pmid=25220133|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011230.pub2|pmc=4262120}}</ref> There; however, was not a lot of evidence and thus this conclusion is not that certain.<ref name=Moja2014/>

 
Ranibizumab does appear to result in a lower risk of stomach and intestinal problems.<ref name=Moja2014/> It is also associated with a low rate of eye related side effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmucker|first1=C|last2=Ehlken|first2=C|last3=Agostini|first3=HT|last4=Antes|first4=G|last5=Ruecker|first5=G|last6=Lelgemann|first6=M|last7=Loke|first7=YK|title=A safety review and meta-analyses of bevacizumab and ranibizumab: off-label versus goldstandard.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=e42701|pmid=22880086|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042701|pmc=3411814}}</ref>

 
The most common side effects in clinical trials were conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous [[floater]]s, increased [[intraocular pressure]], and intraocular inflammation.

 
</ref>  The trial showed that the two drugs "had equivalent effects on visual acuity when administered according to the same schedule;" however, serious adverse events were more common in the bevacizumab arm of the trial.

 
The results of several subsequent head-to-head trials of the two anti-VEGF treatments were later published, and the overall results reinforced CATT's findings. The two therapies performed equally at restoring visual acuity according to a 2012 meta-analysis,<ref name=Jiang2014>{{cite journal|author1=Jiang S|author2=Park C|author3=Barner JC|title=Ranibizumab for age-related macular degeneration: a meta-analysis of dose effects and comparison with no anti-VEGF treatment and bevacizumab|journal=J Clin Pharm Ther|date=Jun 2014|volume=39|issue=3|pages=234–9|doi=10.1111/jcpt.12146|pmid=24635444|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpt.12146/full|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> and also in the IVAN trial, alone and in the investigators' meta-analysis pooling its own results with CATT's.<ref name=IVAN2013>{{cite journal|author1=Chakravarthy U|author2=Harding SP|author3=Rogers CA|author4=Downes SM|author5=Lotery AJ|author6=Culliford LA|author7=Reeves BC|author8=IVAN study investigators|title=Alternative treatments to inhibit VEGF in age-related choroidal neovascularisation: 2-year findings of the IVAN randomised controlled trial|journal=Lancet|date=Oct 12, 2013|volume=382|issue=9900|pages=1258–67|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61501-9|pmid=23870813}}</ref>  A 2012 meta-analysis focused specifically on safety issues concluded that the rates of several adverse events were higher with bevacizumab, although the absolute rates of ocular serious adverse events were low with both therapies: ocular adverse events were about 2.8 times as frequent with bevacizumab than with ranibizumab, and "The proportion of patients with serious infections and gastrointestinal disorders was also higher."  The authors concluded that " clinicians and patients should continue to carefully weigh-up the benefits and harms when choosing between the two treatment options.
