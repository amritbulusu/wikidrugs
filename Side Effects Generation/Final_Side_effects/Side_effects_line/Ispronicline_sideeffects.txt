Ispronicline is subtype-selective, binding primarily to the [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|α4β2]] [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor#Subunits|subtype]]. It has [[antidepressant]], [[nootropic]] and [[neuroprotective]] effects.{{medcn|date=July 2014}}

 
Early stage clinical trials showed that ispronicline was well tolerated, with the main side effects being [[dizziness]] and [[headache]].<ref>Gatto GJ, Bohme GA, Caldwell WS, Letchworth SR, Traina VM, Obinu MC, Laville M, Reibaud M, Pradier L, Dunbar G, Bencherif M.
