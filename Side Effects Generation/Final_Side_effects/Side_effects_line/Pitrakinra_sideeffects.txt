Asthma results from a dysregulated, hyperresponsive [[immune response]] in the airways. Some immune cells in [[allergy|allergic]] asthmatics respond aggressively to foreign allergens with the release of IL-4 and 13, two key mediators that initiate a cycle of inflammation in the lung. Pitrakinra is an antagonist of the [[interleukin-4 receptor]] alpha chain, a protein that is also part of IL-13. It thereby blocks the inflammatory effects of IL-4 and IL-13, interrupting the [[Th2]] lymphocyte immune response.<ref name="Long" /><ref>{{Cite journal
