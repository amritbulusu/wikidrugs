'''Triclocarban''' is an [[antibacterial]] agent common in personal care products like [[soap]]s and lotions as well as in the medical field, for which it was originally developed.<ref>"Anti-bacterial personal hygiene products may not be worth potential risks." UC Davis Health System Feature Story: Anti-bacterial personal hygiene products.... UC Davis Health System, n.d. Web. 12 Mar. 2014. <http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20080903_anti-bacterial/>.</ref> Studies on its antibacterial qualities and mechanisms are growing. Research suggests that it is similar in its mechanism to [[triclosan]] and is effective in fighting infections by targeting the growth of bacteria such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. Additional research seeks to understand its potential for causing antibacterial resistance and its effects on organismal and environmental health.

 
The specific mechanism of action for triclocarban's health effects on humans, like in bacteria, is unclear. Generally, triclocarban enhances the gene expression of other steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and cortisol. It is hypothesized that the compound acts similar to [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s or coactivators that modulate the activity of [[estrogen receptor]]s and [[androgen receptors]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang CY, McDonnell DP | year = 2005 | title = Androgen receptor-cofactor interactions as targets for new drug discovery | url = | journal = Trends Pharmacol.

Activation of these receptors amplifies gene expression and, in doing so, may be the mechanistic base of triclocarban's health impact on humans. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether triclocarban increases the activity of sex steroid hormones by binding to the receptors or by binding to and sensitizing the receptor coactivators.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yueh|first1=Mei-Fei|last2=Li|first2=Tao|last3=Evans|first3=Ronald M.|last4=Hammock|first4=Bruce|last5=Tukey|first5=Robert H.|last6=Appanna|first6=Vasu D.|display-authors=2|title=Triclocarban Mediates Induction of Xenobiotic Metabolism through Activation of the Constitutive Androstane Receptor and the Estrogen Receptor Alpha|journal=PLoS ONE|date=15 June 2012|volume=7|issue=6|pages=e37705|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037705|pmc=3376094|pmid=22761658}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Jiangang|last2=Ahn|first2=Ki Chang|last3=Gee|first3=Nancy A.|last4=Ahmed|first4=Mohamed I.|last5=Duleba|first5=Antoni J.|last6=Zhao|first6=Ling|last7=Gee|first7=Shirley J.|last8=Hammock|first8=Bruce D.|last9=Lasley|first9=Bill L.|display-authors=3|title=Triclocarban Enhances Testosterone Action: A New Type of Endocrine Disruptor?|journal=Endocrinology|date=March 2008|volume=149|issue=3|pages=1173–1179|doi=10.1210/en.2007-1057|pmid=18048496|pmc=2275366}}</ref>

 
Triclocarban has a [[hazard quotient]] rating of greater than one. Hazard quotients greater than one indicate the potential for adverse effects on organisms due to toxicity.<ref name="ac.els-cdn.com"/> As triclocarban is found in high concentrations in aquatic environments, there are concerns regarding its toxicity to aquatic species. Specifically, triclocarban has been shown to be toxic to amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and aquatic plants, and traces of the compound have been found in Atlantic dolphins.<ref name="ac.els-cdn.com"/><ref name="nrdc.org">http://www.nrdc.org/living/chemicalindex/triclosan.asp</ref> The antibacterial components of triclocarban may disrupt hormones critical to the developmental and endocrine processes in exposed animal wildlife. The [[neurological]] and [[reproductive]] systems are particularly affected through contact with this compound. Triclocarban may also affect animal wildlife behavior.<ref name="nrdc.org"/> For example, triclosan and triclocarban are 100-1,000 times more effective in inhibiting and killing algae, crustaceans and fish than they are in killing microbes. Triclocarban and triclosan have been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic blackworms, fish, and dolphins.<ref name="pubs.acs.org">Halden, Rolf U.

One study has investigated how triclocarban remains in the human system after using a bar of soap with traces of triclocarban. Analysis of urine samples from human test subjects shows that, after triclocarban has undergone [[glucuronidation]], its oxidative metabolites are less readily excreted than triclocarban itself. This same study performed [[topical medication|topical]] treatments of triclocarban on rats and, by analyzing urine and plasma levels, demonstrated that triclocarban does remain in the organism's system.<ref name="Schebb, Nils Helge 2011">{{cite journal | author = Schebb, Helge Nils, Inceoglu Bora, Chang Ahn Ki, Morisseau Christophe, Gee Shirley, Hammock Bruce | year = 2011 | title = Investigation of Human Exposure to Triclocarban after Showering and Preliminary Evaluation of Its Biological Effects | url = | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 7| pages = 3109–3115 | pmid = 21381656 | doi=10.1021/es103650m | pmc=3470465}}</ref>

 
Although triclocarban has few to no direct detrimental effects on health aside from allergic reactions, preventing exposure to triclocarban is recommended. Since triclocarban enters the body through pores, wearing gloves, properly washing hands, and overall proper hygiene reduces the risk of skin exposure and irritation.

 
In addition to its adverse effects on humans and the environment, solid triclocarban is a fire hazard. It is particularly combustible as dust. Contamination with other oxidizing agents may also result in combustion.<ref name="datasheets.scbt.com"/>
