Abciximab has a plasma [[half-life]] of about ten minutes, with a second phase half-life of about 30 minutes. However, its effects on platelet function can be seen for up to 48 hours after the infusion has been terminated, and low levels of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockade are present for up to 15 days after the infusion is terminated. Abciximab does not require dose adjustments for patients with renal failure.<ref name="pmid27519521">Usta C, Turgut NT, Bedel A (2016) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=27519521 How abciximab might be clinically useful.] ''Int J Cardiol''  {{DOI|10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.07.213}} {{PMID|27519521}}</ref>

 
==Side-effects==

 
Many of the side effects of abciximab are due to its anti-platelet effects. This includes an increased risk of bleeding. The most common type of bleeding due to abciximab is gastrointestinal [[hemorrhage]].
