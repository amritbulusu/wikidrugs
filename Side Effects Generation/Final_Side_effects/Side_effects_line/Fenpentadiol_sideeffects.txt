{{Quote|text=In three articles the properties of a new psychotropic agent from the series of araliphatic alcohols — phenpentanediol (CXV) — were described (477-479). It is not easy to place this substance anywhere in the pharmacodynamic system of psychotropic agents: on the one hand it potentiates the barbiturate narcosis, on the other it increases motility and exploratory activity in mice and potentiates the effects of amphetamine.|author=|source={{cite book|title=Farmaco.
