Studies have been done in the past on normal, mature and castrate female rats. Benzestrol produced the same type of estrus in the castrate rat when injected at 0.8 to 1.0 micrograms as when the rat was injected with 2.0 to 2.5 micrograms of estrone.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Effects of a New Synthetic Estrogen, Benzestrol Upon the Hematopoietic System in the Rat| doi = 10.1210/endo-36-5-305 |year=1945 |last1=Stebbins |first1=R.B. |last2=Blanchard |first2=E.W. |journal=Endocrinology |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=305}}</ref>  This is significant because less benzestrol could be used to produce the same effect as estrone in increasing estrogen production.  It has been used in the past as a nonsteroidal estrogen antagonist.
