LGD-2226 is an orally active, potent and selective agonist for androgen receptors which was shown to have [[anabolic]] effects in both muscle and bone tissue, but with considerably less effects on [[prostate gland|prostate]] weight and [[lutenizing hormone]] levels than [[testosterone]].<ref>Miner JN, Chang W, Chapman MS, Finn PD, Hong MH, López FJ, Marschke KB, Rosen J, Schrader W, Turner R, van Oeveren A, Viveros H, Zhi L, Negro-Vilar A.

Selective androgen receptor modulators may also be used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to [[anabolic steroid]]s but with significantly less side effects. For this reason, SARMs have already been banned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] since January 2008 despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs are currently being developed,<ref>Thevis M, Kohler M, Schlörer N, Kamber M, Kühn A, Linscheid MW, Schänzer W.
