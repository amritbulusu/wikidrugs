''Cannabis'' plants produce a group of chemicals called cannabinoids, which produce mental and physical effects when consumed.

 
The psychoactive effects of ''cannabis'' are known to have a triphasic nature. Primary psychoactive effects include a state of relaxation, and to a lesser degree, euphoria from its main psychoactive compound, [[tetrahydrocannabinol]]. Secondary psychoactive effects, such as a facility for philosophical thinking, [[introspection]] and [[metacognition]] have been reported among cases of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[paranoia]].<ref name="erowid.org">{{cite web|author=Cannabis|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis (Marijuana) Vault : Effects|publisher=Erowid.org|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Finally, the tertiary psychoactive effects of the drug cannabis, can include an increase in heart rate and hunger, believed to be caused by [[11-Hydroxy-THC|11-OH-THC]], a psychoactive metabolite of [[THC]] produced in the [[liver]].

 
Normal cognition is restored after approximately three hours for larger doses via a [[One hitter (smoking)|smoking pipe]], [[bong]] or [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizer]].<ref name="erowid.org"/> However, if a large amount is taken orally the effects may last much longer. After 24 hours to a few days, minuscule psychoactive effects may be felt, depending on dosage, frequency and tolerance to the drug.
