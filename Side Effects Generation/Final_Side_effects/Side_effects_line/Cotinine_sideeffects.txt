Because cotinine is the main metabolite to nicotine and has been shown to be pharmacologically active, it has been suggested that some of nicotine's effects in the nervous system may be mediated by cotinine and/or complex interactions with nicotine itself.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crooks|first1=PA|last2=Dwoskin|first2=LP|title=Contribution of CNS nicotine metabolites to the neuropharmacological effects of nicotine and tobacco smoking|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|date=Oct 1997|volume=54|pages=743–53|pmid=9353128|doi=10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00117-2}}</ref>
