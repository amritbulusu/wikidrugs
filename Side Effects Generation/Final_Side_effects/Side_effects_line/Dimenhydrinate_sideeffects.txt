8-Chlorotheophylline, a [[Halogenation|chlorinated]] derivative of [[theophylline]], was added in order to counteract [[Somnolence|drowsiness]]. Theophylline is very closely related to [[caffeine]] and [[theobromine]], mild [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant|stimulants]]. It was thought by scientists{{who|date=July 2014}} that by combining the [[antiemetic]] effects of diphenhydramine with a stimulant, the extreme drowsiness induced by the former could be mitigated somewhat by the latter. The sedation caused by diphenhydramine, however, is substantially stronger than the stimulation caused by 8-chlorotheophylline, so the overall effect is still mostly sedating.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

 
Many users report a side effect profile consistent with [[tropane alkaloid]] (e.g. [[atropine]]) poisoning as both show antagonism of [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]] in both the central and autonomic nervous system, which inhibits various signal transduction pathways.<ref name=":0" /> In the CNS, diphenhydramine readily crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]], exerting effects within the visual and auditory cortex.

 
Other CNS effects occur within the [[limbic system]] and [[hippocampus]], causing [[confusion]] and temporary [[amnesia]] due to decreased [[acetylcholine]] signaling. Toxicology also manifests in the autonomic nervous system, primarily at the [[neuromuscular junction]], resulting in [[ataxia]] and extrapyramidal side-effects and the feeling of heaviness in the legs, and at sympathetic post-ganglionic junctions, causing urinary retention, pupil dilation, [[tachycardia]], irregular urination, and dry red skin caused by decreased [[exocrine gland]] secretions, and mucous membranes. Considerable overdosage can lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack), serious [[ventricular dysrhythmia]]s, coma and death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.muirwoodteen.com/over-the-counter-drug-abuse/motion-sickness-pills/|title=Are Teens Abusing Motion Sickness Pills? - Muir Wood Adolescent and Family Services|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref> Such a side-effect profile is thought to give [[ethanolamine]]-class antihistamines a relatively low abuse liability. The specific antidote for dimenhydrinate poisoning is [[physostigmine]], usually given by IV in a hospital.
