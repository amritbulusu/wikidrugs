One significant clinical study in hypertension ran in 2013 using non-selective beta-blocker to study the effects on lowering blood pressure.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Blood pressure lowering efficacy of nonselective beta-blockers for primary hypertension|url = http://www.cochranelibrary.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007452.pub2|doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd007452.pub2|first = Gavin WK|last = Wong|first2 = James M|last2 = Wright}}</ref> In this study 30 participants were given 75&nbsp;mg of moprolol twice a day. Through this study it was found that moprolol had no significant effect on lowering the heart rate.

 
Moprolol was first patented by SIMS in 1987 under US patent number 4647590.<ref>{{Citation|title = Pharmaceutical compositions and their use in the treatment of glaucoma|url = http://www.google.co.ve/patents/US4647590|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> In this patent SIMS states that moprolol can be used to treat glaucoma when administered locally as well as arterial hypertension. Then it goes into the studies conducted that proved the effectiveness of moprolol to treat these conditions without having the side effects of treatments on the market. This led to many other patents over the years, a few of which are listed in the table below:
