* [[Remicade]] (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine [[TNF-alpha]] and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[plaque psoriasis]], and others.  Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life.  Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aaltonen KJ, Virkki LM, Malmivaara A, Konttinen YT, Nordström DC, Blom M |title=Systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of existing TNF blocking agents in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e30275 |year=2012 |pmid=22272322 |pmc=3260264 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030275 |url=}}</ref>

 
On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a [[clinical trial]] it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.<ref>[http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2004/prg101504.pdf Finance.senate.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029135457/http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2004/prg101504.pdf |date=October 29, 2004 }}</ref>  On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular [[COX-2 inhibitor]] [[Celebrex]], an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vaithianathan R, Hockey PM, Moore TJ, Bates DW |title=Iatrogenic effects of COX-2 inhibitors in the US population: findings from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey |journal=Drug Saf |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=335–43 |year=2009 |pmid=19388724 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200932040-00007|url=}}</ref>

Merck & Co. once used [[methylene chloride]], an animal carcinogen on the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.<ref>http://www.p2pays.org/ref%5C01/00155.pdf</ref>
