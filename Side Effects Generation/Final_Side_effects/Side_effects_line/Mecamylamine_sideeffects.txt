In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial in Indian patients with major depression, (''S'')-mecamylamine (TC-5214) appeared to have efficacy as an [[Augmentation (psychiatry)|augmentation]] therapy. This is the first substantive evidence that shows that compounds where the primary pharmacology is antagonism to neuronal nicotinic receptors will have antidepressant properties.<ref name="pmid19040552">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lippiello PM, Beaver JS, Gatto GJ, etal |title=TC-5214 (S-(+)-mecamylamine): a neuronal nicotinic receptor modulator with antidepressant activity |journal=CNS Neurosci Ther |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=266–77 |year=2008 |pmid=19040552 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00054.x |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid17016705">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rabenstein RL, Caldarone BJ, Picciotto MR |title=The nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine has antidepressant-like effects in wild-type but not beta2- or alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit knockout mice |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=189 |issue=3 |pages=395–401 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17016705 |doi=10.1007/s00213-006-0568-z |url=}}</ref> TC-5214 is currently in Phase III of clinical development as an add-on treatment and on stage II as a monotherapy treatment for major depression.
