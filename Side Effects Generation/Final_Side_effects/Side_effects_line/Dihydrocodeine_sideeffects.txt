Dihydrocodeine was developed during the intense international search for more effective antitussives, especially to help reduce the airborne spread of tuberculosis, pertussis, pneumonia, and similar diseases, in the years from c.a. 1895 to 1915. It is similar in chemical structure to [[codeine]]. Dihydrocodeine is twice as strong as codeine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chu-toulouse.fr/IMG/pdf/12_table_conversion_palier_ii_et_iii_v5-2.pdf|title=Equivalence table (in French)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date= 6 March 2016}}</ref>  Although dihydrocodeine does have extremely active metabolites, in the form of [[dihydromorphine]] and dihydromorphine-6-glucuronide (one hundred times more potent), these metabolites are produced in such small amounts that they do not have clinically significant effects.<ref name="IntJClinPharmacolTher2003-Schmidt">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt H, Vormfelde S, Walchner-Bonjean M, Klinder K, Freudenthaler S, Gleiter C, Gundert-Remy U, Skopp G, Aderjan R, Fuhr U |title=The role of active metabolites in dihydrocodeine effects |journal=Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=95–106 |year=2003 |pmid=12665158}}</ref>

 
== Side effects ==

 
Itching and flushing and other effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release in response to the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body.  First-generation antihistamines such as [[tripelennamine]] (Pyrabenzamine), [[clemastine]] (Tavist), [[hydroxyzine]] (Atarax), [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), [[cyproheptadine]] (Periactin), [[brompheniramine]] (Dimetapp), [[chlorphenamine]] (Chlor-Trimeton), [[doxylamine]] (NyQuil) and [[phenyltoloxamine]] (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine [[promethazine]] (Phenergan) may also have a positive effect on hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of promethazine may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (Demerol and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.

 
As with all drugs, side-effects depend on the person taking the medication. They can range in severity from mild to extreme, from headaches to difficulty breathing.

 
Constipation is the one side-effect of dihydrocodeine and almost all opioids which is near-universal.  It results from the slowing of peristalsis in the gut and is a reason dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, codeine, opium preparations, and morphine are used to stop diarrhoea and combat [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) in its diarrhoeal and cyclical forms as well as other conditions causing hypermotility or intestinal cramping. Opium/opioid preparations are used often as a last resort where pain is severe and the bowels are organically loose. It is generally better to treat IBS with a non psycho-tropic opioid such as loperamide hydrochloride which stays contained in the bowel, thereby not causing drowsy effects and allowing many people to work using machines etc. For IBS, hyoscine butylbromide ([[Butylscopolamine|Buscopan]] in the UK) and [[Mebeverine|mebeverine hydrochloride]] (Colofac) can be effective with or without an opium related compound.

 
; Japan : In Japan, dihydrocodeine is available without a prescription; used in cough medicines such as New Bron Solution-ACE.  Dihydrocodeine is used as an antitussive in many products as a Dextromethorphan alternative.  Medicines in Japan which contain dihydrocodeine are coupled with caffeine to offset the sedative effects and discourage recreational use.  Cough medicines containing dihydrocodeine are controlled similarly to dextromethrophan in the United States, in that its sale is strictly limited by purchase quantity and is restricted to persons 20 and older for purchase.

 
As dihydrocodeine can provide a euphoric high when taken in higher-than-therapeutic doses, it is quite commonly abused recreationally. The typical recreational dose can be anything from 70&nbsp;mg to 500&nbsp;mg, or, in users with tolerance, even more.  [[Potentiators]] and [[adjuvants]] are often included when dihydrocodeine is used in an unsupervised fashion, especially [[carisoprodol]], [[hydroxyzine]] and [[first-generation antihistamine]]s, both to intensify the effect and lessen side-effects such as itching.<ref>Jack El-Hai : ''The Nazi and the Psychiatrist: [[Hermann Göring]], Dr. Douglas M.
