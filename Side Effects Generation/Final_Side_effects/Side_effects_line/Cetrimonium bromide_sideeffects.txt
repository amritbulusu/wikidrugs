CTAB has been shown to have potential use as an [[apoptosis]]-promoting anticancer agent for head and neck cancer (HNC).<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Potential Use of Cetrimonium Bromide as an Apoptosis-Promoting Anticancer Agent for Head and Neck Cancer|url = http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/76/5/969|journal = Molecular Pharmacology|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 1521-0111|pmid = 19654225|pages = 969–983|volume = 76|issue = 5|doi = 10.1124/mol.109.055277|first = Emma|last = Ito|first2 = Kenneth W.|last2 = Yip|first3 = David|last3 = Katz|first4 = Sonali B.|last4 = Fonseca|first5 = David W.|last5 = Hedley|first6 = Sue|last6 = Chow|first7 = G.

CTAB exhibited anticancer cytotoxicity against several HNC cell lines with minimal effects on normal [[fibroblast]]s, a selectivity that exploits cancer-specific metabolic aberrations. ''In vivo'', CTAB [[Ablation|ablated]] tumor-forming capacity of FaDu cells and delayed growth of established tumors. Thus, using this approach, CTAB was identified as a potential apoptogenic quaternary ammonium compound possessing ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' efficacy against HNC models.

 
CTAB has been used for applications from nanoparticle synthesis to cosmetics. Due to its use in human products, along with other applications, it is essential to be made aware of the hazards this agent contains. [http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-278833.pdf The Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.] offers a comprehensive [[Safety data sheet|MSDS]] for CTAB and should be referred to for additional questions or concerns.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-278833.pdf|title = Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

CTAB along with other [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium salts]] have frequently been used in cosmetics at concentrations up to 10%. Cosmetics at that concentration must only be used as rinse-off types such as shampoos. Other leave-on cosmetics are considered only safe at or below 0.25% concentrations. Injections into the body cavity of pregnant mice showed [[embryo]]toxic and [[Teratology|teratogenic]] effects. Only [[Teratology|teratogenic]] effects were seen with 10&nbsp;mg/kg doses, while both effects were seen at 35&nbsp;mg/kg doses. Oral doses of 50&nbsp;mg/kg/day showed embryotoxic effects as well.<ref name=":1" /> Similar tests were completed by giving rats 10, 20, and 45&nbsp;mg/kg/day of CTAB in their drinking water for one year. At the 10 and 20&nbsp;mg/kg/day doses, the rats did not have any toxic symptoms. At the highest dose, the rats began experiencing weight loss. The weight loss in the male rats was attributed to less efficient food conversion. The tests showed no microscopic alterations to the gastrointestinal tract of the rats.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The subacute and chronic toxicity of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), a cationic surfactant, in the rat|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00372762|journal = Archives of Toxicology|date = 1976-06-01|issn = 0340-5761|pages = 91–96|volume = 35|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/BF00372762|first = B.|last = Isomaa|first2 = J.|last2 = Reuter|first3 = B.
