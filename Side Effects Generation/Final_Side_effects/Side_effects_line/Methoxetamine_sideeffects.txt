MXE acts mainly as a [[binding selectivity|selective]] and high-[[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] [[NMDA receptor antagonist]], specifically of the [[dizocilpine]] (MK-801) site (K<sub>i</sub> = 257&nbsp;nM).<ref name="pmid23527166" /><ref name="pmid27128862">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zanda MT, Fadda P, Chiamulera C, Fratta W, Fattore L | title = Methoxetamine, a novel psychoactive substance with serious adverse pharmacological effects: a review of case reports and preclinical findings | journal = Behav Pharmacol | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 489–96 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27128862 | doi = 10.1097/FBP.0000000000000241 | url = }}</ref> It produces [[ketamine]]-like effects.<ref name="pmid27128862" /><ref name="pmid22819129">{{cite journal | vauthors = Coppola M, Mondola R | title = Methoxetamine: from drug of abuse to rapid-acting antidepressant | journal = Med.

The qualitative effects of MXE were first described online in May 2010 and the compound became commercially available on a small scale in September 2010,<ref name=emcdda/><ref name="Morris"/> by November use and sale of the MXE had increased enough for it to be formally identified by the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]]. By July 2011, the EMCDDA had identified 58 websites selling the compound at a cost of 145–195&nbsp;euros for 10&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{ cite report | url = http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_143801_EN_SnapshotSummary.pdf | title = Online sales of new psychoactive substances/‘legalhighs’: Summary of results from the 2011 multilingual snapshots | publisher = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction | date = 2011-11-15 | accessdate = 2012-01-23 }}</ref> MXE remains popular despite bans in many countries.
