Selank is a synthetic analogue of the immunomodulatory peptide [[tuftsin]]; as such, it mimics many of its effects. It has been shown to modulate the expression of [[Interleukin-6]] (IL-6) and affect the balance of [[T helper cell]] [[cytokine]]s.<ref name=Uchakina>{{Cite journal

Selank, as well as a related peptide drug, [[Semax]], have been found to inhibit [[enzyme]]s involved in the degradation of [[enkephalin]]s and other [[endogenous]] regulatory [[peptide]]s, and this action may be involved in their effects.<ref name="pmid11443939">{{cite journal |author1=Kost NV |author2=Sokolov OIu |author3=Gabaeva MV | title = Semax and selank inhibit the enkephalin-degrading enzymes from human serum | language = Russian | journal = Bioorg.

In clinical trials, the drug has shown to provide a sustained nootropic and anxiolytic effect which is useful for the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD).<ref name=Uchakina/> Selank has an advantage over traditional anxiety treatments, such as [[benzodiazepines]], as it has no [[sedation|sedating]] or negative cognitive side effects and no associated [[addiction]] or withdrawal problems.
