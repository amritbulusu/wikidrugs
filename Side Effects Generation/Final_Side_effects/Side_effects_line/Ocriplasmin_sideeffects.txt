ThromboGenics, the manufacturer of ocriplasmin, encountered several problems when trying to get approval for the drug. In 2012, the FDA brought up the problem of adverse side effects associated with the drug. The FDA stated that the adverse effects may not cause long-term harm, but that conclusion could not be definitively made.<ref>Carroll J.

The advisory committee brought up several safety issues, but the committee ended up voting that no additional studies were needed.<ref>McBride R.
