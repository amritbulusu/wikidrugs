The effectiveness of orlistat in promoting [[weight loss]] is definite but modest.

Benefits aside, however, orlistat is notorious for its gastrointestinal [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] (sometimes referred to as ''treatment effects''), which can include [[steatorrhea]] (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug.<ref>{{cite web|title=Orlistat Side Effects|url=http://weight-loss.emedtv.com/orlistat/orlistat-side-effects.html}}</ref> In Australia, the United States and the European Union, orlistat is available for sale [[over-the-counter drug|without a prescription]].<ref>{{cite web|title=POISONS STANDARD JUNE 2017|date=June 2017|accessdate=18 August 2017|website=Federal Register of Legislation|publisher=Therapeutic Goods Administration|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L00605}}</ref> Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with [[consumer organization|consumer advocacy]] group [[Public Citizen]] repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds.<ref name="WP2" /> [[Generic drug|Generic]] formulations of orlistat are available in some countries.

Orlistat may reduce plasma levels of [[ciclosporin]] (also known as "cyclosporin" or "cyclosporine", trade names Sandimmune, Gengraf, Neoral, etc.)<!-- "ciclosporin" is the International Nonproprietary Name, not a typo; please do not alter the spelling without discussing -->, an [[immunosuppressive drug]] frequently used to prevent [[transplant rejection]]; the two drugs should therefore not be administered concomitantly.<ref name="XenicalLabel" /> Orlistat can also impair absorption of the [[antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmic]] [[amiodarone]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhi J, Moore R, Kanitra L, Mulligan TE |title=Effects of orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of three highly lipophilic drugs (amiodarone, fluoxetine, and simvastatin) in healthy volunteers |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=428–35 |year=2003 |pmid=12723464 |doi=10.1177/0091270003252236}}</ref> The [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] has recently suggested that Orlistat could theoretically reduce the absorption of [[antiretroviral]] [[HIV]] medications.<ref>{{cite web

 
Orlistat was also recently found to [[Discovery and development of gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors#Mechanism of action|inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS)]], an enzyme involved in the proliferation of cancer cells but not normal cells. However, potential side effects of Orlistat, such as inhibition of other cellular off-targets or poor bioavailability, might hamper its application as an effective antitumor agent. One profiling study undertook a chemical proteomics approach to look for new cellular targets of orlistat, including its off-targets {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}.
