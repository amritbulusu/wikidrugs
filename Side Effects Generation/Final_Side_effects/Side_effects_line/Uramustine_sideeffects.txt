'''Uramustine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''uracil mustard''' is a [[chemotherapy]] [[medication|drug]] which belongs to the class of [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s.  It is used in [[lymph]]atic malignancies such as [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. It works by damaging [[DNA]], primarily in [[cancer]] cells that preferentially take up the [[uracil]] due to their need to make [[nucleic acids]] during their rapid cycles of [[cell division]]. The DNA damage leads to [[apoptosis]] of the affected cells. [[Bone marrow]] suppression and nausea are the main side effects.
