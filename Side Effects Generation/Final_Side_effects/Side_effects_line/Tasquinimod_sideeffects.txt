Tasquinimod may also target the tumor microenvironment by suppressing the tumor hypoxic response, in which genes involved in the adaptation and survival of cells during hypoxia are induced.<ref name="isaacs2012" /> Tasquinimod reduces tumor [[angiogenesis]]; but its anti-angiogenic effects do not appear to be linked to [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) neutralization or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition.<ref name="isaacs2006" /><ref name="olsson2010" />
