In addition to vasodilation, the effects of relaxin are also seen in the kidneys, by significantly increasing [[creatinine]] clearance,<ref name="Ponikowski" /> which is a measure of kidney function, as well as increased renal blood flow.<ref name="Teichman1" />

 
Serelaxin has undergone clinical trials in patients with acute heart failure,<ref name="Teerlink" /> conducted by [[Novartis]].  Serelaxin has completed several clinical trials as a therapy for AHF.  Phase I trials examined safety and tolerability,<ref name="Du" /> while phase II trials evaluated its haemodynamic effects and symptom relief.  The Pre-RELAX-AHF phase II trial administered a dose of 30&nbsp;µg/kg/day and showed a decrease in blood pressure, improved [[dyspnoea]], and increased renal blood flow.<ref name="Teichman1" />  In phase III the RELAX-AHF trial gave a 48hr intravenous infusion of the same dose.<ref name="King" />  It significantly improved patients' dyspnoea, resulted in a 30% reduction in worsening of heart failure symptoms, a decreased hospital stay and a reduction in signs and symptoms of congestion.<ref name="Teerlink" /><ref name="Filippatos" />  The FDA granted serelaxin "breakthrough therapy" designation, meant to expedite the development and review of drugs for life-threatening conditions.<ref name="Novartis" /> On 22 March 2017, Novartis announced that the global Phase III study of serelaxin in patients with acute heart failure did not meet its primary endpoints.<ref>https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-provides-update-phase-iii-study-rlx030-serelaxin-patients-acute-heart</ref>
