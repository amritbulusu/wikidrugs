The dosage and effects are reported to be similar to those of methaqualone, but shorter acting and slightly weaker.

 
Typical reports use between 50 and 500&nbsp;mg of etaqualone, depending on desired effects. Old pharmaceutical formulations of Ethinazone were 350&nbsp;mg tablets. 

 
Etaqualone is thought to act in a similar way to barbiturates and benzodiazepines by increasing the sensitivity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Recreational effects include euphoria, relaxation, increased sociability and sexuality, reduction of short-term memory, and loss of coordination. Combination with other depressants has a potentiating effect and can cause overdose. Tolerance to benzodiazepines or alcohol will also reduce effects.
