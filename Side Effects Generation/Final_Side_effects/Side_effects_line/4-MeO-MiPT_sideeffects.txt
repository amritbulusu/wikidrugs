'''4-MeO-MiPT''', or '''4-[[methoxy]]-''N''-[[methyl]]-''N''-[[isopropyl]][[tryptamine]]''', is a lesser-known [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelic drug]].  It is the 4-methoxy [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[MiPT]]. 4-MeO-MiPT was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and is mentioned in his book ''[[TiHKAL]]'' (''Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved''). Subsequent testing by Shulgin on human test subjects showed the [[effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] as 20-30 [[Milligram|mg]] (or 0.4&nbsp;mg per Kg body weight of subject); the onset time between ingestion and the first noticeable effects was 45-60 min, with sensations lasting between 2-2.5 hours.<ref name=Shulgin /> The sensation were significantly milder than those of [[4-HO-MiPT]], with 4-MeO-MiPT producing [[erotic]]-enhancing effects, and few of the visuals common with [[tryptamines]]. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-MeO-MiPT.
