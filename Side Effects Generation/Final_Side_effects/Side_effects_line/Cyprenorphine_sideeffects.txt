'''Cyprenorphine''' ('''M-285''') is an [[opioid]] [[drug]]. It is related to more well-known opioids such as [[buprenorphine]], which is used as an [[analgesic]] and for the treatment of opioid [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[diprenorphine]], which is used as an [[antidote]] to reverse the effects of other opioids.

 
Cyprenorphine has mixed [[agonistâ€“antagonist]] effects at opioid receptors, like those of buprenorphine. However the effects of cyprenorphine are somewhat different, as it produces pronounced [[dysphoric]] and [[hallucinogenic]] effects which limit its potential use as an analgesic.<ref>Bentley KW, Boura ALA, Fitzgerald AE, Hardy DG, McCoubrey A, Aikman ML, Lister RE.
