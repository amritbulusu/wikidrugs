[[Pelletizing|Pellets]] of mepacrine are inserted through the cervix into a woman's [[uterus|uterine cavity]] using a preloaded inserter device, similar in manner to [[Intrauterine device|IUCD]] insertion. The procedure is undertaken twice, first in the proliferative phase, 6 to 12 days following the first day of the menstrual cycle and again one month later. The [[sclerosing]] effects of the drugs at the utero-tubal junctions (where the [[Fallopian tubes]] enter the uterus) results in [[scar|scar tissue]] forming over a six-week interval to close off the tubes permanently.
