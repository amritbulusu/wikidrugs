Clevidipine is a dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker, highly selective for [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular]], as opposed to [[cardiac muscle|myocardial]], smooth muscle and, therefore, has little or no effect on myocardial [[contractility]] or [[conduction (cardiology)|cardiac conduction]]. It reduces [[mean arterial pressure|mean arterial blood pressure]] by decreasing [[systemic vascular resistance]]. Clevidipine does not reduce cardiac filling pressure ([[preload (cardiology)|pre-load]]), confirming lack of effects on the venous capacitance vessels. No increase in myocardial [[lactic acid|lactate]] production in [[coronary sinus]] blood has been seen, confirming the absence of [[myocardial ischemia]] due to [[coronary steal]].

 
[[Hypotension]] and [[reflex tachycardia]] are potential consequences of rapid upward titration of Cleviprex. In [[clinical trial]]s, a similar increase in heart rate was observed in both Cleviprex and comparator arms. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can produce negative [[inotrope|inotropic]] effects and exacerbate [[congestive heart failure|heart failure]]. Heart failure patients should be monitored carefully. Cleviprex gives no protection against the effects of abrupt [[beta-blocker]] withdrawal.
