* Pregnancy: as with all new molecules, administration of rilmenidine should be avoided in pregnant women, although no teratogenic or embryotoxic effects have been observed in animal studies. 

 
* Effects on the ability to drive motor vehicles or operate machinery: double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have not shown rilmenidine to have any effect on alertness at therapeutic doses (1or 2 daily administrations of 1 mg). If these doses are exceeded, or if rilmenidine is combined with other drugs capable of reducing alertness, vehicle drivers or machine operators should be warned of the possibility of drowsiness.

 
== Side effects ==

 
* At a dose of 1 mg given as a single daily administration during controlled trials, the incidence of side effects was comparable to that observed with placebo. 

 
* At a dose of 2 mg per day of rilmenidine, controlled comparative studies versus [[clonidine]] (0.15 to 0.30 mg/day) or alpha2-[[methyldopa]] (500 to 1000 mg/day) demonstrated that the incidence of side effects was significantly lower with rilmenidine than with either clonidine or a-methyldopa. 

 
Side-effects are rare, non-severe, and transient at therapeutic doses: [[asthenia]], palpitations, insomnia, drowsiness, fatigue on exercise, epigastric pain, dryness of the mouth, diarrhea, skin rash; and exceptionally, cold extremities, postural hypotension, sexual disorders, anxiety, depression, pruritus, edema, cramps, nausea, constipation, hot flushes.
