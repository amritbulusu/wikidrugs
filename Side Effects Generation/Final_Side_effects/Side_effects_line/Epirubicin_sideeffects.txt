Intercalation results in complex formation which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. It also triggers DNA cleavage by [[topoisomerase II]], resulting in mechanisms that lead to cell death. Binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins may be involved in the compound's cytotoxic effects. Epirubicin also generates [[free radical]]s that cause cell and DNA damage.

 
Epirubicin is favoured over [[doxorubicin]], the most popular anthracycline, in some [[chemotherapy regimen]]s as it appears to cause fewer side-effects. Epirubicin has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4' carbon of the sugar – it has the opposite chirality – which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. Epirubicin is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas.
