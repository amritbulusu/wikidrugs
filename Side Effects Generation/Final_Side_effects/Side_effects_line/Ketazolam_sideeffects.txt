Chronic use of ketazolam as with other [[benzodiazepines]] can lead to [[physical dependence]] and the appearance of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] upon cessation of use or decrease in dose. [[drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to ketazolam's therapeutic effects occurs over a period of 15 days.<ref>{{cite journal | journal =Psychol Med Monogr Suppl | year =1988 | volume =13 | pages =1–55 | title =The natural history of tolerance to the benzodiazepines | author =Higgitt A |author2=Fonagy P |author3=Lader M  | pmid =2908516 | doi =10.1017/S0264180100000412 }}</ref>
