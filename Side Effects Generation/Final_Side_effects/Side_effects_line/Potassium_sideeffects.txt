{{chem|40|K}} occurs in natural potassium (and thus in some commercial salt substitutes) in sufficient quantity that large bags of those substitutes can be used as a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations. {{chem|40|K}} is the radioisotope with the largest abundance in the body. In healthy animals and people, {{chem|40|K}} represents the largest source of radioactivity, greater even than {{chem|link=Carbon-14|14|C}}. In a human body of 70&nbsp;kg mass, about 4,400 nuclei of {{chem|40|K}} decay per second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/presentations/radioactive-human-body|title=Radiation and Radioactive Decay.
