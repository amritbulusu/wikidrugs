Remifentanil's short context-sensitive half-life makes it ideal for intense pain of short duration. As such, it has been used for analgesia in labor successfully; however, it is not as effective as epidural analgesia.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|title=A randomized controlled trial of the efficacy and respiratory effects of patient-controlled intravenous remifentanil analgesia and patient-controlled epidural analgesia in laboring women.|date= Mar 2014|pmid=24149580|doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182a7cd1b|volume=118|issue=3|pages=589–97}}</ref>

 
Due to its quick metabolism and short effects, remifentanil has opened up new possibilities in anesthesia. When remifentanil is used together with a hypnotic (i.e. one that produces sleep) it can be used in relative high doses.  This is because remifentanil will be rapidly eliminated from the blood plasma on termination of the remifentanil infusion, hence the effects of the drug will quickly dissipate even after very long infusions. Owing to synergism between remifentanil and hypnotic drugs (such as [[propofol]]) the dose of the hypnotic can be substantially reduced.<ref name = Patel>{{cite journal |doi= 10.2165/00003495-199652030-00009 |vauthors=Patel SS, Spencer CM |title=Remifentanil |journal= Drugs |volume= 52|date=Sep 1996 |issue=3 |pages=417–27 |pmid=8875131}}</ref> This leads often to more hemodynamic stability during surgery and a quicker post-operative recovery time.

 
==Side-effects==

 
Remifentanil is a specific [[Μ-opioid receptor|μ-receptor]] agonist.<ref name = Patel/>   Hence, it causes a reduction in [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone, [[respiratory depression]] and [[analgesia]]. The drug's effects include a dose-dependent decrease in [[heart rate]] and [[arterial pressure]] and [[respiratory rate]] and [[tidal volume]]. [[Muscle rigidity]] is sometimes noted.

 
The most common side effects reported by patients receiving this medication are a sense of extreme "dizziness" (often short lived, a common side effect of other fast-acting synthetic phenylpiperidine narcotics such as [[fentanyl]] and [[alfentanil]]) and intense itching ([[pruritus]]), often around the face.  These side effects are often controlled by either altering the administered dose  (decreasing or in some cases, increasing the dose) or by administering other [[sedative]]s that allow the patient to tolerate or lose awareness of the side effect.

 
Prior to the development of remifentanil, most short-acting hypnotics and amnestics faced issues with prolonged use, where accumulation would result in unfavorable lingering effects during post-operative recovery. Remifentanil was designed to serve as a strong anesthetic with an ultra-short and predictable duration that would not have accumulation issues.<ref>Feldman, P. L. (2006).
