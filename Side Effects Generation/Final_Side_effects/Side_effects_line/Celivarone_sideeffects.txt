Celivarone is a non-iodinated [[benzofuran]] derivative, structurally related to [[amiodarone]], a drug commonly used to treat arrhythmias.<ref name = "Gautier" /> Celivarone has potential as an antiarrhythmic agent, attributable to its multifactorial mechanism of action; blocking [[Sodium channel|Na<sup>+</sup>]], [[L-type calcium channel|<small>L</small>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] and many types of [[Potassium channel|K<sup>+</sup> channel]]s ([[hERG|''I''<sub>Kr</sub>]], [[KCNE1|''I''<sub>Ks</sub>]], [[G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel|''I''<sub>KACh</sub>]] and [[KCNA5|''I''K<sub>v</sub>1.5]]), as well as inhibiting β<sub>1</sub> receptors, all in dose-dependent manners.<ref name = "Gautier"/><ref name = "Kowey">{{cite journal|last1=Kowey|first1=PR|last2=Aliot|first2=EM|last3=Cappucci|first3=A|last4=Connolly|first4=SJ|last5=Crijns|first5=HJ|last6=Hohnloser|first6=SH|last7=Kulakowski|first7=P|last8=Roy|first8=D|last9=Radzik|first9=D|last10=Singh|first10=BN|title=Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Dose-ranging Study of the Efficacy and Safety of SSR149744C in Patients with Recent Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter [abstract]|journal=Heart Rhythm|date=2007|volume=5|issue=Suppl|page=S72}}</ref> The mechanisms by which celivarone modifies ion flow through these channels is unknown, but hearts demonstrate longer PQ intervals and decreased cell shortening, indicative of blocked <small>L</small>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, depressed maximum current with each action potential with no change in the [[resting membrane potential]], caused by blocked Na<sup>+</sup> channels, and longer action potential duration due to K<sup>+</sup> channel blocks.<ref name = "Gautier"/><ref name = "Gautier2">{{cite journal|last1=Gautier|first1=P|last2=Serre|first2=M|last3=Cosnier-Pucheu|first3=S|last4=Djandjighian|first4=L|last5=Roccon|first5=A|last6=Herbert|first6=JM|last7=Nisato|first7=D|title=''In vivo'' and ''in vitro'' Antiarrhythmic Effects of SSR149744C in Animal Models of Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology|date=February 2005|volume=45|issue=2|pages=125–135|doi=10.1097/01.fjc.0000151899.03379.76|pmid=15654261}}</ref> Celivarone is therefore described as having class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties.<ref name = "Gautier"/><ref name = "Gautier2" />

 
Celivarone may be an effective [[Antihypertensive drug|antihypertensive]] therapy, as it inhibits both [[angiotensin II]] and [[phenylephrine]] induced [[hypertension]] in dogs, despite having no affinity for these receptors.<ref name = "Gautier" /> Atrial fibrillation is especially common in hypertensive adults<ref name = "Hoffmann" /> so a single drug to combat both problems is desirable. The non-iodinated nature of celivarone means that the harmful side-effects on the [[thyroid]] commonly seen with amiodarone therapy are eliminated, making the drug an attractive alternative.<ref name = "Gautier" /><ref name = "Gautier2" /> Higher oral [[bioavailability]], shorter duration of action, and lower accumulation in [[body tissue]]s are also benefits of celivarone.<ref name = "Gautier" /><ref name = "Gautier2" /> Presently, two studies are underway to determine if the effects observed in the animal models are reproducible in a human population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double Blind Placebo Controlled Dose Ranging Study of the Efficacy and Safety of SSR149744C 300 or 600 mg for the Conversion of Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter (CORYFEE)|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00232310|website=ClinicalTrials.gov|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dose Ranging Study of Celivarone with Amiodarone as Calibrator for the Prevention of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Interventions or Death (ALPHEE)|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00993382|website=ClinicalTrials.gov|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref>
