The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for biotin in 1998. At that time there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for biotin. In instances such as this, the Board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The current AI for adults ages 19 and up is 30 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 30 μg/day. AI for lactation is 35 μg/day. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 5-6 μg/day For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 8 to 25 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of biotin there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline | chapter = Biotin | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 1998 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 374–389 | url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6015&page=374 | accessdate = 2017-08-29 | isbn = 0-309-06554-2}}</ref>  

 
Animal studies have indicated few, if any, effects due to high level doses of biotin.  This may provide evidence that both animals and humans could tolerate doses of at least an order of magnitude greater than each of their nutritional requirements.  There are no reported cases of adverse effects from receiving high doses of the vitamin, in particular, when used in the treatment of metabolic disorders causing seborrheic [[dermatitis]] in infants.<ref name=Combs2>{{Cite book| author = Combs, Gerald F.
