Outside the [[central nervous system]], dopamine functions primarily as a local [[neurotransmitter|chemical messenger]].  In blood vessels, it inhibits [[norepinephrine]] release and acts as a [[vasodilator]] (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the [[pancreas]], it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces [[Gastrointestinal physiology#Motility|gastrointestinal motility]] and protects [[intestinal mucosa]]; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of [[lymphocytes]].  With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.

 
Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. [[Parkinson's disease]], a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the [[midbrain]] called the [[substantia nigra]]. Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured, and in its pure form marketed as ''Levodopa'' is the most widely used treatment for the condition. There is evidence that [[schizophrenia]] involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drugs]] used to treat this are [[dopamine antagonist]]s which reduce dopamine activity.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Moncrieff J | title =The myth of the chemical cure.

===Cellular effects===

Whereas emotions are difficult to investigate in animals, the learning function is mediated by neuronal reward prediction error signals which implement basic constructs of reinforcement learning theory.

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (“wanting”) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&nbsp;... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.<!--&nbsp;...

Later observations, however, have caused the dopamine hypothesis to lose popularity, at least in its simple original form.<ref name=Howes/>  For one thing, patients with schizophrenia do not typically show measurably increased levels of brain dopamine activity.<ref name=Howes/>  Also, other [[dissociative]] drugs, notably [[ketamine]] and [[phencyclidine]] that act on [[glutamate]] [[NMDA receptor]]s (and not on dopamine receptors) can produce psychotic symptoms.<ref name=Howes/> Perhaps most importantly, those drugs that do reduce dopamine activity are a very imperfect treatment for schizophrenia:  they only reduce a subset of symptoms, while producing severe short-term and long-term side effects.<ref name=Muench/>  Even so, many psychiatrists and neuroscientists continue to believe that schizophrenia involves some sort of dopamine system dysfunction.<ref name=Healy/>  As the "dopamine hypothesis" has evolved over time, however, the sorts of dysfunctions it postulates have tended to become increasingly subtle and complex.<ref name=Healy/>

Altered dopamine neurotransmission is implicated in [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), a condition associated with impaired [[cognitive control]], in turn leading to problems with regulating attention ([[attentional control]]), inhibiting behaviors ([[inhibitory control]]), and forgetting things or missing details ([[working memory]]), among other problems.<ref name="Malenka ADHD neurosci">{{cite book | vauthors = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE | veditors = Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 0-07-148127-3 | pages = 266, 318–323 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapters 10 and 13}}</ref>  There are genetic links between dopamine receptors, the dopamine transporter, and ADHD, in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters.<ref name=Wu>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu J, Xiao H, Sun H, Zou L, Zhu LQ | title = Role of dopamine receptors in ADHD: a systematic meta-analysis | journal = Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 605–20 | year=2012 | pmid = 22610946 | doi = 10.1007/s12035-012-8278-5 }}</ref> The most important relationship between dopamine and ADHD involves the drugs that are used to treat ADHD.<ref name=Berridge3/> Some of the most effective therapeutic agents for ADHD are psychostimulants such as [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin, Concerta) and [[amphetamine]] (Adderall, Dexedrine), drugs that increase both dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain.<ref name=Berridge3>{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge CW, Devilbiss DM | title = Psychostimulants as cognitive enhancers: the prefrontal cortex, catecholamines, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = e101-11 | year=2011 | pmid = 20875636 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.06.023 | pmc=3012746}}</ref> The clinical effects of these psychostimulants in treating ADHD are mediated through the [[indirect agonist|indirect activation]] of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, specifically [[dopamine receptor D1|dopamine receptor D<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|adrenoceptor A<sub>2</sub>]], in the [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref name="Malenka ADHD neurosci" /><ref name="Unambiguous PFC D1 A2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The cognition-enhancing effects of psychostimulants involve direct action in the prefrontal cortex | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 77 | issue = 11 | pages = 940–50 | year=June 2015 | pmid = 25499957 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.09.013 | pmc=4377121}}</ref><ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 1069–89 | year=2015 | pmid = 25591060 | doi = 10.1162/jocn_a_00776 }}</ref>
