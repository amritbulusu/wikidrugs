It was under development as drug candidate for [[female sexual dysfunction]] and [[erectile dysfunction]] but clinical development ceased by 2003, and as of 2017, no product containing melanotan II was marketed and all commercial [[drug development|development]] had ceased.<ref name=Adis/> Unlicensed and untested powders sold as "melanotan II" are found on the Internet, and purported to be effective as "tanning drugs", though side effects such as uneven pigmentation, new [[nevi]] (moles) and darkening or enlargement of existing moles are common and have led to medical authorities discouraging use.<ref>Brennan R, Wells JS, Van Hout MC.

To the extent that melanotan II produces [[melanogenesis]], this is thought to be caused by activation of the MC<sub>1</sub> receptor, whereas its observed sexual effects are thought to be related to its ability to activate the MC<sub>4</sub> receptor (though the MC<sub>3</sub> is thought to possibly also be involved).<ref name="NorrisLopez2010">{{cite book|author1=David O.

Other effects of melanotan II, mostly regarded as [[adverse effect]]s, include [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[stretching]], [[yawning]], and [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]] (the last via activation of MC<sub>4</sub>).<ref name="PlantZeleznik2014">{{cite book|author1=Tony M.
