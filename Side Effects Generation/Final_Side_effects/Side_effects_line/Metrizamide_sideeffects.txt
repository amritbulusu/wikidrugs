Both agents are administered by spinal tap (lumbar puncture - LP or cisternal puncture at the cervicocranial junction).  The human patient is rolled from the lateral decubitus (lying on the side) to prone.  Ankles are strapped to the end of a hard X-ray, CT, or MRI table.  To obtain images of the cervical region the patient is then carefully tilted cephalad (toward the head) so contrast agent (particularly Pantopaque) can enter the neck region.  Care is given to prevent spilling dye into the posterior fossa (back of the head) or to enter the cranial cavity in general.  This speaks to the inability to remove the heavier or more viscous Pantopaque without aspirating it with spinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture needle in the low back (sticking up vertically) or back of the neck.  With Metrizamide the issue is that if entering the cranial cavity and high dose exposure to the blood brain barrier, side effects are more likely encountered.  Issues related to absorption into the general circulation are also encountered.
