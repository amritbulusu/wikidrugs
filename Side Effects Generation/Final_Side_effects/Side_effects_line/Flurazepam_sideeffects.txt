== Side effects ==

 
The most common adverse effects are dizziness, drowsiness, light-headedness, and [[ataxia]]. Flurazepam has abuse potential and should never be used with [[alcoholic beverage]]s or any other substance that can cause drowsiness.  Addictive and possibly fatal results may occur. Flurazepam users should only take this drug strictly as prescribed, and should only be taken directly before the user plans on sleeping a full night. Next day drowsiness is common and may increase during the initial phase of treatment as accumulation occurs until steady-state plasma levels are attained.

 
A review paper found that long-term use of flurazepam is associated with [[drug tolerance]], [[drug dependence]], [[rebound insomnia]] and CNS related adverse effects. Flurazepam is best used for a short time period and at the lowest possible dose to avoid complications associated with long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirkwood CK |title=Management of insomnia |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=688–96; quiz 713–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10533351 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Flurazepam and other benzodiazepines such as [[fosazepam]], and [[nitrazepam]] lost some of their effect after seven days administration in [[psychogeriatric]] patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Viukari M |author2=Linnoila M |author3=Aalto U.  |date=January 1978 | title = Efficacy and side effects of flurazepam, fosazepam, and nitrazepam as sleeping aids in psychogeriatric patients | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–35 | pmid = 24980 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1978.tb06871.x }}</ref> Flurazepam shares cross tolerance with barbiturates and [[barbiturates]] can easily be substituted by flurazepam in those who are habituated to barbiturate sedative hypnotics.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rooke KC. | year = 1976 | title = The use of flurazepam (dalmane) as a substitute for barbiturates and methaqualone/diphenhydramine (mandrax) in general practice | journal = J Int Med Res. | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 355–9 | pmid = 18375 | doi=10.1177/030006057600400510}}</ref>

 
Flurazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] drugs causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.<ref name="Mets-2010">{{cite journal | last1 = Mets | first1 = MA. | last2 = Volkerts | first2 = ER. | last3 = Olivier | first3 = B. | last4 = Verster | first4 = JC. | title = Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness. | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 14 |date=Feb 2010 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 | pmid = 20171127 }}</ref> An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including flurazepam, the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy in elderly persons. Tolerability in elderly patients, however, is improved marginally in that benzodiazepines have moderately higher risks of falls, memory problems, and disinhibition ("paradoxical agitation") when compared to non-benzodiazepine sedatives. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Chronic use of sedative-hypnotic drugs for the management of insomnia does not have an evidence base and has  been discouraged due to concerns including potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of sedative hypnotics has been determined to be no better than placebo after 3 months of therapy and worse than placebo after 6 months of therapy.

Flurazepam is a "classical" benzodiazepine; some other classical benzodiazepines include [[diazepam]], [[clonazepam]], [[oxazepam]], [[lorazepam]], [[nitrazepam]], [[bromazepam]], and [[clorazepate]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Braestrup C |author2=Squires RF. | date=1 April 1978| title = Pharmacological characterization of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain | journal = Eur J Pharmacol | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–70 | pmid = 639854 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(78)90085-7 }}</ref> Flurazepam generates an [[active metabolite]] with a very long [[elimination half-life]].<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov" /> Flurazepam could be therefore unsuitable as a sleeping medication for some individuals due to next-day sedation; however, this same effect may also provide next-day anxiety relief. Residual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of flurazepam, such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions, may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and [[hip fractures]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vermeeren A. | year = 2004 | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs. | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–328 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref>
