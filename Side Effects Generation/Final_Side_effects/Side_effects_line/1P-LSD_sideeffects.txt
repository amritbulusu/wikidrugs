While 1P-LSD shows only 38% the potency of LSD in mice, LSD is detected via [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] when 1P-LSD is incubated in human serum.<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Simon D.

This partially explains the effects of 1P-LSD, because the compound itself is unable to bind to the 5-HT2A receptors responsible for the effects of psychedelic drugs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://detect-kit.com/is-1p-lsd-a-prodrug-to-lsd/ | title=Is 1P-LSD A Prodrug To LSD? | publisher=Detect-Kit | date=15 October 2015 | accessdate=15 October 2015 | author=Jose}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jhet.5570200154/abstract | title=Hydrolysis of amides.

The effects profile of 1P-LSD is not well defined. It is generally thought to be comparable to that of LSD.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://link.springer.com/bookseries/7854 | chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7854_2016_15 | DOI=10.1007/7854_2016_15 | pmid=27272067 | ISSN=1866-3370 | title=Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences | publisher=Springer International Publishing | author=Fabrizio Schifano | author2=Laura Orsolini | author3=Duccio Papanti | author4=John Corkery | date=June 2016 | pages=1–30 | OCLC=643052237 | chapter=NPS: Medical Consequences Associated with Their Intake}}</ref>
