===Side effects===

 
The main side effects of glybuzole and other sulphonylureas are induction of [[hypoglycaemia]], weight gain, abdominal upset, [[headache]], and [[hypersensitivity]] reactions. Hypoglycaemia is mainly caused by excesses in insulin production due to doses that are too high, or due to the eating habits of the patient.<ref name="diabeta"/>

 
There are some drugs that prolong the effects of drugs such as glybuzole and thereby increase the possibility of hypoglycaemia, these drugs include allopurinol, sulfonamides, acetylsalicylic acid and derivatives and fibrates.<ref name="Haberfeld"/><ref name="Dinnendahl"/>

 
In case of pregnancy, there are more severe toxic effects as tested in rats. At a dose of 2100&nbsp;mg/kg, there were cases of fetal death, developmental abnormalities in the [[central nervous system]], the eye and ear, and [[craniofacial]] abnormalities (including face and nose) 7 to 13 days after conception. At a lower dose (1050&nbsp;mg/kg) it resulted in [[fetotoxicity]] (no death, but e.g. [[stunted growth|stunted fetus]]), and developmental abnormalities in the [[musculoskeletal system]].<ref name="yamaguchiglybuzole"/>
