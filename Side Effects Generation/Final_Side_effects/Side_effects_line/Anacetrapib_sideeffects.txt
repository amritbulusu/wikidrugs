Merck started a Phase III trial to assess the drug's effects on LDL, HDL, clinically measurable cardiovascular events, and safety;<ref name=NCT00685776>{{cite web

 
Cardiologist [[Steven Nissen|Steve Nissen]] (in 2010) described DEFINE as a medium-sized safety trial intended to find out "whether anacetrapib would show the same increase in adverse cardiovascular events that was seen with torcetrapib." Fortunately, anacetrapib did not.  In his opinion the DEFINE study was too small to show a clear benefit, but the trends in the major adverse cardiovascular events were going in the right direction.<ref>{{cite web | title=DEFINE: Large effects on LDL and HDL cholesterol with CETP inhibitor anacetrapib | url=http://www.theheart.org/article/1151979.do|author =O'Riordan, Michael|publisher = theheart.org

 
The REVEAL (Randomized EValuation of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid-modification) will assess whether there is clinical benefit associated with anacetrapib. REVEAL recruited 30,000 participants<ref>{{cite web|title=HPS3/TIMI55 â€“ REVEAL trial of Anacetrapib in high-risk vascular patients recruits the target of 30,000 participants |url=http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/news/REVEAL%20Press%20Release%2002%20September%202013.pdf |publisher=University of Oxford Clinical Trial Service Unit & Epidemiological Studies Unit |date=September 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022217/http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/news/REVEAL%20Press%20Release%2002%20September%202013.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}</ref> for a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial]].

 
The study will compare patients with a history of vascular disease (such as heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease) on 100&nbsp;mg of anacetrapib daily to those on placebo, to determine if the addition of anacetrapib reduces the risk of major coronary events (defined as the composite of coronary death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization).<ref>{{cite web | title= REVEAL: Randomized EValuation of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid-modification | url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01252953?term=reveal&rank=1 | author=National Institute of Health | publisher = clinicaltrials.gov |date=January 30, 2012}}</ref>
