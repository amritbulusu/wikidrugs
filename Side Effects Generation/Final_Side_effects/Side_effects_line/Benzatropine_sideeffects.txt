Benzatropine is an [[anticholinergic]] drug used in patients to reduce the side effects of [[antipsychotic]] treatment. Benzatropine is also a second-line drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It improves [[tremor]], and may alleviate rigidity and [[bradykinesia]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. Benzatropine is also sometimes used for the treatment of [[dystonia]], a rare disorder that causes abnormal muscle contraction, resulting in twisting postures of limbs, trunk, or face. In veterinary medicine, benzatropine is used to treat [[priapism]] in stallions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=DV|last2=Nickels|first2=FA|last3=Williams|first3=MA|title=Pharmacologic treatment of priapism in two horses|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=1 Nov 1991|pages=1183–4|accessdate=}}</ref>

Drugs that decrease cholinergic transmission may impair storage of new information into long-term memory. Anticholinergic agents can also impair time perception.<ref name="pmid2661606">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gelenberg AJ, Van Putten T, Lavori PW, Wojcik JD, Falk WE, Marder S, Galvin-Nadeau M, Spring B, Mohs RC, Brotman AW | title = Anticholinergic effects on memory: benztropine versus amantadine. | journal = Clinical Psychopharmacology | year = 1989 | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 180–5 | pmid = 2661606 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-198906000-00004 }}</ref>

 
Benzatropine is a centrally acting [[anticholinergic]]/[[antihistamine]] agent. It is a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Benzatropine partially blocks cholinergic activity in the basal ganglia and has also been shown to increase the availability of dopamine by blocking its reuptake and storage in central sites, and as a result, increasing dopaminergic activity. Animal studies have indicated that anticholinergic activity of benzatropine is approximately one-half that of atropine, while its antihistamine activity approaches that of [[mepyramine]]. Its anticholinergic effects have been established as therapeutically significant in the management of Parkinsonism. Benzatropine antagonizes the effect of [[acetylcholine]], decreasing the imbalance between the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and [[dopamine]], which may improve the symptoms of early Parkinson's disease.<ref>MIMS Australia Pty Ltd.
