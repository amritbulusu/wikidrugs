Its analgesic effects are due to its actions on the sensory tracts of the spinal cord. In addition, phenacetin has a depressant action on the heart, where it acts as a negative [[inotrope]]. It is an [[antipyretic]], acting on the brain to decrease the temperature set point. It is also used to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (subacute type) and intercostal [[neuralgia]].

 
Phenacetin was widely used until the third quarter of the twentieth century, often in the form of an '''"A.P.C."''' or [[aspirin]]-phenacetin-[[caffeine]] [[compound analgesic]], as a remedy for fever and pain. An early formulation (1919) was [[Vincent's APC]] in Australia. However the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing phenacetin in November 1983, owing to its [[carcinogen]]ic and kidney-damaging properties (Federal Register of October 5, 1983 (48 FR 45466)). It was also banned in India.<ref name=ban>{{cite web|url=http://cdsco.nic.in/html/drugsbanned.html|title=Drugs banned in India|publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India|accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref> As a result, some branded, previously phenacetin-based preparations continued to be sold, but with the phenacetin replaced by safer alternatives. A popular brand of phenacetin was [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]]'s [[Saridon]], which was reformulated in 1983 to contain [[propyphenazone]], [[paracetamol]] and [[caffeine]]. [[Coricidin]] was also reformulated without phenacetin. Paracetamol is a metabolite of phenacetin with similar analgesic and antipyretic effects, but the new formulation has not been found to have phenacetin's carcinogenicity.

 
Phenacetin, and products containing phenacetin, have been shown in an [[animal model]] to have the side effect and after-effect of [[carcinogenesis]]. In humans, many case reports have implicated products containing phenacetin in urothelial neoplasms, especially [[urothelial carcinoma]] of the [[renal pelvis]]. In one prospective series, phenacetin was associated with an increased risk of death due to urologic or renal diseases, death due to cancers, and death due to cardiovascular diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199101173240304 |vauthors=Dubach U, Rosner B, Stürmer T | title = An epidemiologic study of abuse of analgesic drugs.
