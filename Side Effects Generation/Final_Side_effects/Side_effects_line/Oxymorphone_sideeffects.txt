Oxymorphone extended-release tablets are indicated for the management of chronic pain and only for people already on a regular schedule of strong opioids for a prolonged period. Immediate-release oxymorphone tablets are recommended for breakthrough pain for people on the extended-release version. Some protocols for severe breakthrough pain in chronic pain conditions add Numorphan ampoules as a third form of the drug. As of 2009, an oxymorphone nasal spray was being developed for this purpose with unknown release date; some practitioners prefer [[fentanyl]] immediate-release formulations such as [[Actiq]] or [[Fentora]] for this purpose despite fentanyl's occasional severe side effects.<ref name="OUP09">{{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-19-157532-7 | title = Opioids in Cancer Pain | last1 = Davis | first1 = MP | author2 = Glare, PA | author3 = Hardy, J | edition = 2nd | year = 2009 | origyear = 2005 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, UK  | pages =  }}</ref>

 
== Adverse effects ==

 
The principal adverse effects of oxymorphone are similar to other opioids with constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dry mouth and drowsiness being the most common adverse effects. This drug is highly addictive as with other opioids and can lead to chemical dependence and withdrawal.<ref name = MD/>

 
It elicits its effects by binding to and activating the [[mu opioid receptor]] (MOR) and, to a lesser extent, the [[delta opioid receptor]] (DOR).<ref name = OUP09/> Its activity at the DOR likely augments its action at the MOR.<ref name = OUP09/> Oxymorphone is 10 times more potent than morphine.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prommer|first1=E|title=Oxymorphone: a review|journal=Supportive Care in Cancer|date=February 2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=109â€“15|pmid=16317569|doi=10.1007/s00520-005-0917-1}}</ref>
